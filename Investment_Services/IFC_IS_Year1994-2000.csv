The 13,900 ha rubber plantation is located within a concession of 35,000 ha.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Privatization plans call for the Government to sell to private investors 75% of the shares of the company.  The project also involves rehabilitation of 1,000 ha of plantation, modernization of the processing plant, and installation of new machinery for widening the firm''s product line.Environmental Category and Issues		This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure. Environmental and occupational and health issues associated with this project include land use, air emissions, liquid effluents, noise generation and pesticide handling and application.  The SOGB plantation was originally established on a 35,000 ha concession of which approximately 50% was developed and 50% was retained as original vegetation.  This 50:50 split will be sustained.  The facilites do not generate air emissions other than the normal odors associated with a rubber processing unit and the liquid effluent is treated in a series of solid rubber traps and aerobic/anaerobic ponds to bring the BOD level below 50 mg/liter. The treated effluent is used for irrigation purposes.  As part of the project, the processing operation will be modernized to bring noise levels below 85 dBA.  SOGB has agreed to comply with the World Bank guidelines for pesticide handling and application.  Mature rubber plantations use virtually no chemicals other than occasional use of herbicides for control of vegetation in the tree row, and at SOGB weed control is normally done by manual labor.  IFC will ensure ongoing compliance with World Bank guidelines during the life of the project by evaluating monitoring reports submitted annually to IFC by SOGB, and by conducting periodic supervision.

Given that Smith-Enron''s revenues are linked to US dollars whereas the loan payments are to be made in DEM, the DEG loan would give rise to currency risk.  The proposed currency swap would exactly match the DEM payments required under the DEG loan and provide a hedge, effectively transforming the liability into a fixed rate US dollar series of obligations.  The currency swap transaction would be priced on the basis of standard IFC pricing guidelines for client risk management transactions.  IFC''s total exposure on this risk management transaction is estimated at approximately US$1.5 million.This transaction will support the developmental objective cited in IFC''s initial investment in this power project.  The proposed swap transaction would serve as a hedge to reduce the potential currency risk arising from DEM liability payments against US dollar-based revenues.  The currency swap would improve the stability of the Company''s future cashflows and enhance its underlying profitability.Environmental Categories and IssuesThe proposed transaction is of a financial nature only, and accordingly is classified as a category C Project according to IFC''s environmental review guidelines and procedures.Date SPI sent to PIC	August 11, 1995For additional Information contact:  Corporate Relations Unit - telephone:(202) 473-7711 facsimile:(202) 676-0365.","","","","","","","","","","","","","",1.50 million (USD)Product LineIFC Investment (million USD)Risk Management1.50GuaranteeLoanEquity* These investment figures are indicative,"","","","","","",7131,"",AC - Heavy Fuel Oil - Thermal Power Generation,"","","",""

KRB will provide banking and financial services to micro-enterprises which would otherwise be excluded from borrowing from formal financial institutions due to lack of collateral and high transaction costs.  The transformation is necessary because K-Rep''s micro-credit program in existence, since 1984, has long since surpassed its ability to fund continued growth via non-market, concessional sources.  As a bank, KRB will be able to fund itself directly through deposit taking and public stock offerings.  KRB will be the first private bank in Kenya, and just one of the two banks in Africa, that is fully targeted to serving micro-enterprises.  KRB is expected to have a major impact on income and employment creation among low-income groups as has been demonstrated by K-Rep and similar institutions worldwide.  In addition to its very real benefits vis-a-vis income and employment, the KRB project represents an extension of the Kenyan financial system: a broadening of the range of financial services offered and the percentage of the population with access to these services; and an opening and democratization of capital markets.Environmental Categories and Issues	The project is a Category ""C"" project according to IFC Environmental Review Procedures and therefore no environmental review is required.Date SPI sent to PIC		September 7, 1995For additional information contact:  Corporate Relations Unit:telephone: (202) 473-7711facsimile: (202) 676-0365","","","","","","","","","","","","","",1.0 million (USD)Product LineIFC Investment (million USD)Risk ManagementGuaranteeLoanEquity1.0* These investment figures are indicative,"","","","","","",7017,"",HA - Microfinance and Small Business - Non Commercial Banking,"","","",""

It operates six malt plants in Germany, with total production capacity of 425,000 tons annually. WM also operates the IFC funded Albadomu malt project in Hungary which has a capacity of 65,000 tons p.a. About 50 percent of its production is exported worldwide, notably to Japan and Latin America. WM sales for 1995 are expected to exceed US$200 million. WM will own 50% of the equity, and IFC and DEG 25% each. This structure is similar to that of the Albadomu project in Hungary.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The US$27.5 million investment program will be financed with (i) a US$7.2 million equivalent long-term loan from DEG; (ii) a US$7.2 million equivalent long-term loan from IFC; (iii) a US$1.4 million equivalent in shareholders loan from WM; a(iv) US$3.5 million in short-term debt from local banks in Poland; and(v) US$8.2 million equivalent in equity from WM (50%), DEG (25%), and IFC (25%). Location of project and Description of site	The project will be located on a 3 hectare site leased from the port authority for 30 years in the port of Gdansk and thus well placed to export malt. Gdansk is at the center of a barley producing area and the project will be in a favorable position to source its raw materials. The annual requirements of 81,500 tons of barley will be procured within a distance of less than 120 kms.	The malt plant will be located in the industrial part of the Gdansk port, in northern Poland. The site can be reached by sea, by rail and by road.	The property has a size of 30,000 m2, with a quay line of about 80 m facing the Martwa Wisla, a branch of the Wisla, Polands main river.	Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The project addresses the existing malting capacity shortage by establishing a modern and efficient plant with significant competitive advantages vis-a-vis existing malt plants in Poland, such as modern and efficient technologies, economies of scale and proximity to raw materials.  The project is a net foreign exchange earner with the combined savings and earnings of about US$30 million annually.  Given the stringent specifications required for the malting process, a malsters and farmers need to establish close and durable relationships which are mutually beneficial.  Working closely with the Company and becoming steady suppliers, farmers would experience noticeable benefits since malting barley is generally more profitable than other cereals, especially in the proximity of a malting plant.  In addition, farmers would benefit from WM''s agriculture research efforts, which would result in the introduction of better barley varieties and farming practices.  The economic rate of return for the project is estimated at 31%.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFC environmental review procedures. The plants is designed to meet exceedingly strict German environmental standards with regards to effluent discharge, dust emission, and noise levels. The company has confirmed that it will comply with all applicable World Bank environmental standards.	The malting process uses 3 to 4 m3 of water for each ton of malt produced. Water is to be sourced from ground wells to be constructed on the site; which is situated on the banks of the River Wisla. The plant''s water off-take will have no impact on the underlying aquifer and ground water levels. After steeping the water would normally have a high biological oxygen demand (BOD) level but the use of water for cleaning the chambers means that the final BOD after water arriving at the effluent treatment plant is much lower. The treatment plant consists of settlement tanks and aerobic treatment systems. After meeting all relevant standards, the water will be discharged into the river. Effluent discharge amounts to less than 1 m3 of water per ton of malt - as moisture is lost to the atmosphere during the germination and kilning processes.The  is  from the Public Information Center.Date SPI sent to PIC December 1, 1995For Additional Information contact:  Corporate Relations Unit -telephone: (202) 473-7711facsimile: (202) 676-0365Environmental documents for this project are available at http://www.ifc.org and from the World Bank InfoShop (http://www.worldbank.org/html/pic/aboutinfo.html).","","","","","","","","","","","","","",8.79 million (USD)Product LineIFC Investment (million USD)Risk ManagementGuaranteeLoan6.84Equity1.95* These investment figures are indicative,"","","","","","",4928,"","AA - Grain Processing (Milling, Starch, Flour, Malt)","","","",""

IFCs portion will be US$4.5 million.Location of project and Description of site	The project is at Iduapriem in the Western Region of Ghana.  The project is located within the existing Mining Lease granted by the Republic of Ghana in 1989.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The project consists of the construction of Heap Leach pads and associated facilities to process low grade ore.  The project also includes a national employee housing component.  The existing open pit gold mine and a carbon-in-pulp (CIP) treatment plant was commissioned in 1992 to mine and treat 1.5 mtpa of ore to produce 110,000 ounces of gold per annum.  Fine tuning after commissioning increased nominal capacity to 2.1 mtpa.  High grade ore was to be processed in the initial years of operation with low grade ore to be stockpiled for later processing.  Over the last two years GAG has considerably expanded its Reserve and Resource estimates.  Based on the additional Reserves, GAG decided to expand processing capacity to 4.0 mtpa.  The expansion is being undertaken in two phases.  Phase I, an upgrade of the existing CIP plant to allow 2.8 mtpa throughput producing about 150,000 oz of gold per annum, and the provision of Gold Hedging facilities, has been approved by IFC (IFC/R95-141).  Phase II, the current project, will heap leach low grade ore from mining operations and from the existing low grade stockpile.  Gold production will increase by about 40,000 oz per year for the first two years, and once the ore stockpile is exhausted, incremental production will be about 20,000 oz of gold per year, bring total annual production to about 170,000 oz.  The housing component will construct 60 senior staff houses and 150 junior staff houses for Ghanaian staff.  The financing package for Phase I and II involves a combination of Shareholder and Senior Loans as well as the introduction of Gold Hedging facilities.  IFC, as lead financier of the original mine financing, was requested by GAG to co-ordinate the expansion financing. Gold is Ghanas largest export product, and Government development strategy emphasizes the continued expansion of the mining sector.  The GAG project is consistent with Government strategy and will increase Ghanas gold exports and the Government of Ghanas taxation revenues.     Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to the IFCs environmental review procedure because a limited number of impacts may occur, for which there are recognized performance standards and design criteria for minimizing or avoiding impacts.  The environmental review comprised a review of the environmental assessment undertaken for the proposed operation, further information supplied by the sponsor and site visits undertaken by Technical and Environmental staff.  The existing operation is well run and fully complies with World Bank and host country guidelines and policies.  Annual Environmental audits are carried out by the sponsor.

Sucrerie Bourbon - Tay Ninh,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,East Asia and the Pacific,Vietnam,Sucrerie de Bourbon - Tay Ninh Limited,Regional Industry - MAS Asia & Pac,1996-02-07T05:00:00Z,"",B,Loan,"Summary Of Project Information (SPI)Project NameViet Nam-Sucrerie Bourbon - Tây NinhRegionAsiaSectorProject No004810Projected Board DateFebruary 28, 1996Company NameSucrerie Bourbon - Tây Ninh (SBT), Ltd.Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders	The main sponsor is Groupe des Societes de Bourbon (GSB), a family owned company based in Réunion, a French island in the Indian Ocean. GSB started operations in 1948 with a sugar refinery, among the first in Réunion. The project is co-sponsored by two Vietnamese companies: Vinasugar, a State-owned enterprise, whose mandate is the development of the sugar industry in Southern Viet Nam, and Tanisugar, a province-owned enterprise in Tây Ninh whose main operation is the production and trade of sugar. GSB would own 70% of the voting shares and the two Vietnamese companies 15% each.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Total project cost is estimated at US$95 million. IFC is considering a US$42.0 million investment in SBT, of which US$22.0 million for IFCs own account (the IFC A Loan) and US$20.0 million for participants accounts (the IFC B Loan). Location of project and Description of site	The proposed sugar mill is to be built on a 32 ha site located about 25 km north of the city of Tây Ninh. The land will be excised from the Tan Hung state farm which is presently producing sugar cane and manioc. The topography of the area is flat with a slight, less than 1%, slope to the south west. Preliminary soil tests show this to be a relatively homogeneous site with an adequate load bearing capacity of 12 tons per square meter; some piling will be required for more massive structures but this is not expected to exceed 20 meters.	The site is 6 km from the main provincial road to Tây Ninh and the access road will be upgraded to an all-weather standard. In addition the provincial government has agreed to construct a new north-south district road to improve access to the site for cane transport. Sugar will be evacuated to Ho Chi Minh City by way of the Vàm Cò Dong River using barges. This route will also be used to import the larger items of machinery. Project plans call for the construction of a jetty and 1,000 m2 warehouse on a site which has been acquired some 15 km south east of Tây Ninh.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The Company will construct a sugar refinery to produce 100,000 tpy of sugar to international quality standards and meet anticipated growth in demand in the country. Currently, Viet Nam imports over 20% of its sugar requirements of about 500,000 tpy, from Thailand and China. Sugar consumption in Viet Nam is constrained by product availability.	The economic fundamentals of the refining operation favor local production of sugar over importation of the finished product and the Government has a policy of supporting and enhancing the viability of the sugar industry which will make the country self sufficient in sugar. Under its Master Plan Study, the Government has estimated that sugar production will have to increase to 1 million tons per year by the year 2000 in order to meet domestic requirements. The introduction of modern sugar production technology is therefore a key element in the Governments strategy to increase sugar production in Viet Nam. The area currently planted with sugar cane in Viet Nam would allow increasing sugar production from 325,000 tpy to 655,000 tpy, thus moving towards the Governments goal of reaching 1 million tpy of sugar by 2000. Project completion is estimated for December 1997. The project would operate during the sugarcane harvest season which lasts about five months (December-April) in Tây Ninh province. During this period, waste and residue will be used to fuel a power plant with a capacity of 24 MW, to be used by Sucrerie Bourbon - Tây Ninh (SBT).Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure. Environmental, health and safety issues include site location, air emissions, liquid effluent, and solid waste management. Occupational health and safety issues include fire safety and emergency response, and general employee health and safety. The facilitys site is now part of  a state-owned farm. It is about 4.5 km from the nearest village and there are no concentrations of people residing in the immediate vicinity. People living on the state farm are expected to produce sugar cane for SBT because it would be the most profitable activity. However, should they prefer different activities, they would be free to do so. The factory design incorporates the latest state of the art wet scrubbing of flue gases to eliminate particulate emissions which are the most objectionable feature of older sugar mill chimneys. Liquid effluent will receive primary and secondary treatment and will comply with local requirements and World Bank guidelines. Solid wastes from the process will be used to generate electricity. The facility will use fire protection codes, work instructions and employee training programs. IFC will ensure ongoing compliance with World Bank guidelines during the life of the project by evaluating monitoring reports submitted annually to IFC by SBT and by conducting periodic supervision.The  is available from the Public Information Center.Date SPI sent to PIC February 7, 1996For Additional Information contact:  Corporate Relations Unit -telephone: (202) 473-7711facsimile: (202) 676-0365Environmental documents for this project are available at http://www.ifc.org and from the World Bank InfoShop (http://www.worldbank.org/html/pic/aboutinfo.html).","","","","","","","","","","","","","",22.0 million (USD)Product LineIFC Investment (million USD)Risk ManagementGuaranteeLoan22.0Equity* These investment figures are indicative,"","","","","","",4810,"",AB - Sugar and Confectionery,"","","",""

The Sisecam Group controls all five operating companies.  Sisecam''s major shareholder is Turkiye Is Bankasi A.S., one of Turkey''s largest commercial banks, with about 70% ownership of the Group. Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment                     The total project cost including all five sub-projects is $334 million.  The projected IFC funding will be a $70 million loan of which about $35 million on IFC''s account and $35 million on the account of participants.Location of project and Description of site                     The float glass line is located at a new site within an existing industrial park, about 20 km from the port of Mersin in South East Anatolia.  The glassware factory and glass container factory will be located adjacent to one of Sisecam''s existing glass container factories near Mersin, about 7 km from the float glass project.  The glass fiber project is located at its existing site near the town of Gebze, 40 km south east of Istanbul.  The cogeneration project will be located adjacent to Sisecam''s existing float glass lines near Kirklareli in the Thrace region of Turkey.Description of Company and Purpose of Project                     The Sisecam Group is implementing a major modernization and expansion program from 1994 through 1997, to alleviate production capacity constraints caused by growing demand for glass products. The five sub-projects are as follows:  (i) a float glass line of 215,000 tonnes capacity to be operated by Trakya, Sisecam''s float glass producer;  (ii) a glassware factory with a capacity of 35,000 tonnes of soda lime mechanical glassware, to be operated by Kirklareli; (iii) a glass container factory with a capacity of 95,000 tonnes, to be operated by ACS; (iv) a glass fiber factory with a capacity of 30,000 tonnes, to be operated by Cam Elyaf; and (v) a 27 MW cogeneration plant supplying electricity and steam to Trakya and Kirklareli, to be operated by Camis Elektrik, a new Sisecam company.  The cogeneration project is motivated principally by forecasts of power shortages in Turkey beginning in 1997.Environmental Category and Issues                     This is an environmental review category B project;  principal issues include air emissions, liquid effluent, waste management and occupational health and safety.  Sisecam is investing in environmental protection measures to mitigate the environmental impacts of the projects and meet local requirements and World Bank guidelines.  For its Trakya float glass line, the company will install a flue gas desulfurization unit and an electrostatic precipitator to treat waste gases from the float furnace.  Because centralized wastewater treatment facilities will not be installed by the industrial park until a future date, biological wastewater treatment facilities for the Trakya plant will be constructed as part of the project.  At the ACS and Kirklareli plants, Sisecam will use the locally available No. 6 fuel oil in the expansions, but by December 31, 1999, will either switch to natural gas which is expected to arrive in the area by that time, or bring the plants into compliance with European Union requirements by that time.  The new glass fiber production line at Cam Elyaf will include bag filters to control particulates.  Sisecam''s cogeneration plant will be fueled by natural gas and employ low NOx burners to reduce emissions.  Solid wastes from Sisecam''s plants are used internally in other operations, disposed of in accordance with local practice, or recycled. Noise abatement procedures are included in designs, while filters and ventilation measures will be used to reduce particulate matter and vapors.

Mr. Stead owns an engineering company in Harare, Zimbabwe.  Mr. Walsh, who oversees the current operations, will be General Manager of the project in Mozambique.  He will manage both CBF and CPT (Companhia de Pescas de Tete).  The other 27% of the shares are jointly owned by Israel Franca and Caesar Bento, both Mozambican nationals. Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Total Project cost is estimated at US$413,000 equivalent and IFC has been asked to provide a loan of US$205,000.Location of project and Description of site	CPT will fish, mainly for Kapenta, on Lake Cahora-Bassa.  It will have a landing, and fish drying and packing facilities at a site in the central region at Manyere Island on Lake Cahora Bassa.  This is located 35kms from the main fishing area of Chikowa.  The lake is a man-made reservoir, over 250 kms long and up to 50 kms wide, on the lower Zambezi River above the Cahora Bassa high dam.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	CBF already operates five Kapenta fishing rigs on the lake.  Kapenta, small sardine-like fish which travel in large shoals and which have become established in the lake, are caught and landed at CBFs site where they are sun-dried and exported mostly to the main population centers in Zimbabwe.  The project is for the expansion of the fleet from five to ten rigs and the improvement of the shore-based facilities.  As one company is only allowed five rigs, CPT, the new company, will use the five new licences by leasing the rigs from CBF.  CPT will sell all its produce to CBF who will be responsible for all the marketing of the Kapenta.  The main markets for the increased output will be in Zimbabwe and Zambia where Kapenta is a highly popular, low cost food, very high in protein content.  The project will employ over 40 people.

This resulted in the destruction of infrastructure and disrupted commercial and other activities. Apart from providing low cost food, employment will be created especially for unskilled local people. IFCs role is to provide the shortfall in finance to bring the project to reality considering the acute lack of term financing in Mozambique. Environmental Category and Issues	This is an environmental review category B project.  Environmental and occupational health and safety issues include: sustainable fishing, waste disposal, CFCs (if the sponsors decide to build a cold room), general housekeeping and safety issues, and emergency preparedness.  Sustainability of fish stocks is not, at this stage, an issue as fishing fleets and processing plants on Lake Cahora Bassa are relatively small and undeveloped as compared with Lake Kariba for instance.  IFC and CBF have been in touch with the Government concerning the fleet carrying capacity of the lake, the issue of sustainibility will be closely monitored.

IFC would provide a loan of US$250 million, of which US$75 million would be for IFCs own account. The balance would be provided through debt for debt swaps from existing lenders (US$100 million) and through a syndication with participant banks (US$75 million).Location of project and Description of site	Throughout VenezuelaDescription of Company and Purpose of Project	CANTV is the Venezuelan national and international telecommunications operator which was partly privatized in 1991, with World Bank assistance.  The privatization involved the sale of 40% of the Companys shares, with control, via a competitive bidding process to a consortium led by GTE Corporation, for a consideration of US$1.885 billion. CANTV currently operates a telecommunication network with 2.5 million telephone lines in service, plus a cellular telephone subsidiary with 170,000 subscribers. In accordance with its Concession Agreement, CANTV is required to modernize and expand its telephone network annually during the period 1992-2000.  During this period CANTV must, inter alia, install a minimum of 3 million new digital telephone lines (including 640,000 replacement lines) and 53,400 additional new public telephones.                                                                              Given the current difficulties Venezuelan companies are experiencing in accessing international capital and bank syndicated loan markets, IFC has been requested to arrange a syndicated loan of about  US$250 million, of which US$75 million would be from IFCs own resources.  The loan would (i) assist with the funding of the 1996 and 1997 portions of the Investment Program which will cost US$774 million, and (ii) help with a US$556 million restructuring of CANTVs debt by swapping US$100 million of existing 3 and 4 year loans into an 8 year IFC B loan.                                                                                           Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria. Key environmental and occupational health and safety issues that are of potential concern in this project include: right-of-way alignment; development of previously undisturbed land (e.g. forest); solid and liquid wastes; PCBs; fire prevention and emergency response; and employee exposure to noise, other physical agents, and hazardous  materials.  The Environment Division has completed a review of the environmental information submitted by CANTV, dated December 18, 1995.  This information adequately addresses issues pertaining to right-of way, waste disposal, and safety issues.

Engro Paktank Terminal Limited,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Middle East and North Africa,Pakistan,Engro Vopak Terminal Limited,Regional Industry - MAS Asia & Pac,1996-03-07T05:00:00Z,"",B,Loan,"Summary Of Project Information (SPI)Project NamePakistan-Engro Paktank TerminalRegionAsiaSectorProject No007163Projected Board DateMay 14, 1996Company NameEngro Paktank Ltd.Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders	Engro Paktanks shareholders are: (i) Engro Chemical Pakistan (50%), an existing IFC client, Pakistans second largest producer of urea fertilizer; and Royal Pakhoed N.V. (50%) of the Netherlands, a leading international company in chemical handling and tank farm operations.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The project cost is estimated at US$65 million, with start of commercial operations scheduled for September 1997.  IFCs proposed financing consists of a US$12 million A loan, and a US$5 million B loan for the account of participants.Location of project and Description of site	The project will be located in Port Qasim on the outskirts of Karachi, Pakistan.  The project site is next to the main dry cargo handling berths.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Engro Paktank (EPTL) is a joint venture Company established to set up a dedicated liquid chemical jetty and tank farm in Port Qasim.  The facilities, which include a jetty capable of handling up to 2 million mtpy of products, and a tank farm with an initial capacity for storage and handling of 280,000 mtpy, will serve the needs of existing chemical importers in Port Qasim, and of new chemical plants being set up in an industrial development zone adjacent to the harbour area.  The project will remove a major bottleneck to import of liquid chemicals feedstocks to Pakistan, and will help divert the handling of potentially hazardous products from the congested downtown Karachi port.  EPTLs first major customer will be ICI Pakistan Ltd., which will import paraxylene and acetic acid for a grassroots PTA plant now under construction in Port Qasim.  PTA is the main feedstock for polyester production.  The project will thus assist the backward integration of the textile industry, Pakistans most important manufacturing base, helping to secure its long term competitiveness.  EPTL is also expected to act as a catalyst for the development of new chemical projects in Pakistan, particularly plastics producers, who in turn will foster downstream, labor intensive plastics processing industries.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure.  Environmental and occupational health and safety issues associated with this project include site location and potential impact on local eco systems, air emissions, liquid effluent treatment, spill prevention, fire protection and emergency response, public consultation and public dissemination.  The Engro Paktank project is located within the Port Qasim area which is being developed as a major industrial area.  The terminal will be built on a greenfield site, which is bare with only a few devastated mangrove bushes along the river bank.  Other nearby river banks are vegetated with mangroves but these areas will remain untouched by the project.  Air emissions from the facility will be limited.  Tanks will be of the fixed roof type equipped with internal floating roof to limit losses and procedures will be established to reduce losses from the tank truck filling.  Domestic sewage will be treated in a septic tank system to comply with local requirements and World Bank guidelines before discharge.  Rain water from areas with potential for contamination will be screened before discharge.  The terminal will be equipped with tanks to receive liquid contaminants.  The terminal will be designed to prevent spills according to international recognized standards.  Pipelines from the jetty to the storage area will only be filled during ship unloading.  All tanks will be equipped with automatic overfilling protection systems and bunds able to store the full tank load.  The bunds will be lined to prevent potential spillage from seeping into the ground.  A risk assessment study has been conducted including consequence calculations.  Conservative consequence calculations have shown that even a worst case spill will not result in irreversible impact on nearby mangrove areas.  The fire prevention and fire emergency plan includes foam and cooling water systems, fire hydrants and foam sprinklers.  During preparation of the environmental assessment for the terminal project, contact has been made with local, internationally recognized non-governmental organizations, who will review the environmental assessment and prepare comments based on contacts with local villagers.  Comments received will be considered during the final design.

Shantou Ocean Enterprises Petroleum and Petrochemical Company Limited (or its nominee), which is a subsidiary of Shantou Ocean Enterprise (Group) Company, will hold 40% of the equity.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The project cost is up to US$ 146 million of which IFC investment is up to $102.2 million, which comprises the A loan of up to $24.9 million, the B loan of up to $70 million, and the C loan of up to $7.3 million.  The C loan is subordinated to the A and B loans.Location of project and Description of site	The project is located in Shantou, Guangdong province, on Chinas southern coast.  The project will be built on a site of 57,000 square meters in Shantous Da Hao District, part of an industrial area in which a deep water port, power plant, petrochemical works, tank farms and storehouses are planned to be developed by 2010.Description of Company and Purpose of Project (include IFC role\development impact)	The Company is a Sino-foreign venture limited liability company to be incorporated in China.  The project plans to establish world-scale cavern and a breakbulk terminal facility for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to address growing LPG imports, particularly in South China, and the inefficiency and inadequacy in the existing LPG import, breakbulk and storage system.	The project is in line with IFCs strategy to catalyze large, high-quality investments by world class sponsors through limited recourse financing.  This project is also consistent with IFCs plan to support projects which have direct, positive environmental impacts.  By helping make LPG more readily available, this project could further encourage the substitution of LPG for coal and wood, thereby reducing air pollution in China.  The project is expected to have strong development impact:- it could help China make significant savings on foreign exchange; and - construction of the project is expected to take 2 years and could provide jobs to up to 1,000 persons, most of whom will be local residents.During its operation phase, the project expects to employ about 58 staff.                                                                                                                                                                                             Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category A project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure.  Environmental and occupational and health issues associated with this project include site locations, previous and existing land use, impact on the marine and terrestrial environment, wildlife and coastal resources, air emissions, waster water and solid waste management, fire and explosion prevention, emergency response, and public consultation and disclosure.  The sponsors have prepared a full comprehensive environmental assessment.  As described in the environmental assessment, the project will be designed, constructed and operated in a manner consistent with Caltex and industry standards as well as World Bank policies and guidelines to minimize any impact to the environment.  The project is located within the Shantou Economic Development Zone designated for industrial development.  The site is on the coast in an area characterized by granite formations with very sparse vegetation.  The land utilization after construction of the underground caverns will be low and impact on the terrestrial environment will be limited.  The sea bed around the terminal and jetty is mainly granite formations covered with sediments from a nearby river and not of special ecological value.  The site and the sea in front of the terminal is not used by the local villagers or fishermen and no resettlement will be necessary.  The terminal will be designed, built and operated according to state-of-the-art technology, and will be able to withstand potential seismic activities in the area.  Further, the terminal is located with a protective granite hill in between the facility and residential areas.  Public information on the general development of the area has been carried out by the local authorities and a project specific public meeting was held in January, 1996 after announcement on the front page of the local newspaper.  Local leaders, fishermen and villagers participated in this meeting in which the environmental assessment was discussed.  The environmental assessment has been disclosed locally.

LaSource is owned 60% by Normandy Poseidon Ltd, a publicly listed Australian Company, and 40% by Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières, a French state owned natural resource and geological survey group.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Total project cost is $100 million to be financed on a 60/40 debt:equity basis.  Senior Loans of $60 million will be financed by IFC, CDC, Proparco and the European Investment Bank (EIB).  IFCs investment will be $3.5 million in equity and $15.8 million in loans.Location of project and Description of site	The project is located at Kasese in the Western region of Uganda, 420 km west of Kampala.  The project site consists of a sublease from KML of approximately 75 ha of land that covers the existing pyrite stockpiles and sufficient area for the proposed processing plant and ancillary facilities.Description of Company and Purpose of Project (include IFC role\development impact)	The project will process an existing stockpile of cobalt-rich pyrite concentrate, in order to produce 1000 tonnes per annum of cobalt. The stockpile, of slightly more than 820,000 dry tonnes of pyrite concentrate assaying 1.38% cobalt, will provide sufficient reserves to produce 10,300 tonnes of cobalt over 11 years.  The concentrate stockpile remains from the mining and processing of a copper sulphide ore by KML.  The deposit was mined for 26 years (1956-1982) and processing the ore gave a copper concentrate which was sent to the Jinja Copper Smelter, and a cobalt rich concentrate which was stockpiled at the Kasese railway terminal, 12km from the Kilembe mine.  The project will utilize a bioleaching process to produce cobalt cathodes (99.8% cobalt).  The project will include a limestone quarry to produce 90,000 tpa of limestone to be used as a neutralizing agent, and a small dedicated 10 MW hydro-electric plant to provide power to the project. The project has a number of features that ensure a strong positive developmental impact.  The stockpile is a valuable resource which is not currently utilized and erosion of the stockpile has had a negative impact on the surrounding environment.  Reprocessing of the stockpile results in a significant environmental improvement by placing newly processed tailings in a more secure tailings deposit in a chemical matrix significantly less susceptible to leaching of heavy metals.  The project will provide a boost to economic activity through a combination of increased employment, local purchasing, exports and taxation receipts to Government.  The hydro electric power station will have surplus capacity during periods of high rainfall, and will be able to provide power to the national grid.  Commercial bank finance is not currently available to Uganda in sufficient quantities of the required maturity to finance a private sector project of this size. IFC involvement is essential to complete the financing plan.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category A project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure because diverse and significant environmental impacts may result.  Environmental issues relating to this project include: water supply and management for process water and hydroelectric power, tailings disposal following reprocessing, dust control, noise impacts from reprocessing and quarry operations, site reclamation, resettlement, and public consultation and disclosure. The existing cobalt concentrate stockpiles are severely eroding and visibly contaminating waterways and shorelines of Lake George within the Queen Elizabeth National Park.  The sponsor has implemented mitigation measures to intercept and control surface runoff above and on the site in order to minimize further erosion of the stockpiles.  Reprocessed tailings will be placed in new engineered tailings dams, and land reclamation will be phased throughout the projects lifetime to reduce erosion and dust generation.  Process water will be recycled, and any excess will be neutralized prior to discharge.  The sponsor has agreed to compensate land users for the hydroelectric plant transfer canal right-of-way and will provide water taps for local use.  The sponsor has also agreed to coordinate its construction plans for the hydroelectric plant for potential offtake of tailrace water by local water users.  Noise effects on residents near the projects limestone quarry will be mitigated by using conventional excavating techniques, and, when blasting is required, limiting blasting to once per week and using low burden explosives and microdelays to minimize noise. Approximately 200 squatters living in huts on the polluted sediment trails were relocated in 1992 and compensated by the municipality (funds for compensation were provided by the sponsor).

Ownership of this land will be transferred to smallholder farmers upon maturity of the palms.  This aspect of the project is expected to benefit up to 70,000 people.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category A project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure.  Environmental and occupational and health issues associated with this project include land development and forest sector policy, resource recovery and air emissions, liquid effluents, solid waste management and integrated pest management.  The KSP plantations are largely located within old underdeveloped transmigration schemes, and are designed to mitigate the social problems caused by the unsuccessful schemes.  No virgin forest will be converted due to the project.  Based on documentation supplied by KSP, the Environmental Assessment, documentation on public consultation and disclosure and site visits, it is concluded that the KSP project is being developed in full compliance with Government of Indonesia rules and regulations and World Bank policies and guidelines.  The project does not involve any involuntary resettlement and the local villagers can decide independently, village by village, whether they want to participate in the development scheme.  The wastewater treatment at the existing mill is designed to meet local requirements and World Bank guidelines and the effluent will be recycled for irrigation purposes.  New mills will be based on the same high standard.  KSP''s facilities will only produce solid waste which is all combustible in the installed boilers or biodegradable by digestion.  KSP has established integrated pest management (IPM) systems at its existing plantations and these will be expanded to all plantations.  KSP''s IPM includes use of nesting owls for rat control, biological control of pests and green ground coverage for weed and erosion control.  IFC will ensure ongoing compliance with World Bank guidelines during the life of the project by evaluating monitoring reports submitted annually to IFC by KSP and by conducting periodic supervision.The  are  from the Public Information Center.Host country location of environmental documentsUniversitas Panca Bhakti, Jl.

It will contribute 75% of the equity of MOCITA.  Its wholly-owned subsidiary, Anglo American Farms Limited (AMFARMS), will have primary oversight and management responsibilities for the project.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	US$10.6 million, of which IFC will provide loan of US$3.0 million for its own account.Location of project and Description of site	The Company is located in Xai Xai, which is some 220 km. northeast of Maputo (the capital of Mozambique).  The factory site is 4 km from the town center.Description of Company and Purpose of Project (include IFC role\development impact)	MOCITA was established in 1966 to process cashewnut into kernels for bulk export.  It operated profitably for 15 years and its production reached a peak of 18,000 tpa.  It stopped normal operations in 1981 as a result of civil war in the country and was taken over by the Government until 1994 when it was returned to the owners.  The proposed project will rehabilitate the factory, install a new processing line, and establish a nursery to distribute 100,000 cashew trees per annum to farmers.  IFC has worked closely with the sponsors for two years, beginning with the funding of the feasibility study by the Italian Trust Fund.  IFC assisted with restructructing the project concept to include proper arrangement for procuring the cashewnut and broadening the product mix to include branded consumer items  -  all of which will ensure that the project can operate effectively without protection.  The development impact of the project includes supporting 2,000 farmers who will be induced to reactivate their cashew farms so as to supply cashew to the project, creating 700 jobs in the factory, and generating export earnings of US$11 million per year.  In addition, the project will pay export parity price for its cashew, which will increase producers (mostly smallholder farmers) income and contribute toward poverty alleviation.  The project will also assist the tree planting program that will ensure the long-term survival of the cashew sector.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  Environmental and occupational health and safety issues associated with this project include site location, air emissions, liquid effluent treatment, solid waste management, fire prevention and emergency control.  The site has in the past been used for cashew nut processing and there are no environmentally sensitive areas in the vicinity.  Air emissions will mainly be from the factory boiler units.  These high efficiency units will utilize cashew nut shell liquid (CSNL) extracted from the cashew nuts during the processing.  Concentrations of SO2 and particulate matter in the flue gas will be negligible.  All other parameters will comply with local requirements and World Bank guidelines.  Wash water from the facility will be used to irrigate gardens and sports fields.  Sewage water will be treated in a septic tank system designed for more than 200% overload.  Solid wastes will consist of peels and nut rejects.  MOCITA is seeking to enter into agreement with a nearby ceramics factory to sell these wastes for use as a fuel.  Fire prevention will be included in the factory design and an emergency response plan will be developed and implemented before commissioning of the factory.  IFC will ensure ongoing compliance with World Bank guidelines during the life of the project by evaluating monitoring reports submitted annually to IFC by MOCITA and by conducting periodic supervision.The  is  from the Public Information Center.Date SPI sent to PIC April 16, 1996For Additional Information contact:  Corporate Relations Unit -telephone: (202) 473-7711facsimile: (202) 676-0365Environmental documents for this project are available at http://www.ifc.org and from the World Bank InfoShop (http://www.worldbank.org/html/pic/aboutinfo.html).","","","","","","","","","","","","","",3.0 million (USD)Product LineIFC Investment (million USD)Risk ManagementGuaranteeLoan3.0Equity* These investment figures are indicative,"","","","","","",7008,"",AI - Other Food,"","","",""

Another major shareholder is Consolidated Farming Investments (CFI) Limited which controls around 35% ownership.  One of CFIs subsidiary buys the offals generated by the Company for use in manufacturing livestock feed.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	US$9.35 million of which IFC has been requested to provide US$3.0 million (US$2.0 million of loan and US$1.0 of equity)Location of project and Description of site	Harare, ZimbabweDescription of Company and Purpose of Project	Midlands was established in 1929 and currently has capacity to mill 148 tons per day of wheat and 170 tons per day of maize.  In addition to wheat flour and maize flour, Midlands produces a wide range of other products, including snackfood based of maize grits, wheat and maize brans, stockfeeds for poultry and dog meals.  In addition, the Company breaks bulk of several consumer products, like rice, salt, groundnut, etc., for repackaging into small sizes for retail sale, primarily to utilize its marketing channels more fully.  The proposed project will erect a new wheat flour with 140 tons per day capacity in Harare.  Most of Zimbabwes wheat is grown around Harare and the city is the primary market for flour products.  Thus, the project will translate into lower transportation cost on wheat input and flour output, which are important competition considerations arising from Zimbabwes reform programs that deregulated the marketing functions of the state agency Grain Marketing Board and dismantled the price controls on bread.  IFCs assistance will play a complementary role to the Banks efforts in bringing about the reforms.  IFC will assist the private sector to adjust to the new environment, help to jump-start the supply reponse, and enhance competition in wheat flour milling.  In addition, IFC will be a catalyst for the listing of Midlands shares on the local stock exchange, thereby helping to deepen capital market activities in the country.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  Environmental and occupational health and safety issues associated with this project include site location, air emission control, solid waste recycling, noise emission, fire and dust explosion prevention, and compliance of existing facilities.  The project site is located in an industrial area with direct access to the national rail system.  Air pollution is controlled by a combination of cyclones and bag filters.  Of the 140 tons of grain processed per day, approximately 110 tons will end up as flour.  The remaining 30 tons of organic material will be used for production of stock feed.  The overall facility will have low ambient noise emissions.  The milling operation itself will be encapsulated, and employees in need of visiting this area will use hearing protection.  Fire and dust explosion prevention is an integral part of the mill design.  A health and safety committee is meeting regularly to ensure a continuous high safety standard.  Midlands is presently carrying out environmental audits for its existing mills and any deviation from full compliance with local requirements and World Bank guidelines will immediately be corrected.  IFC will ensure ongoing compliance with World Bank guidelines during the life of the project by evaluating monitoring reports submitted annually to IFC by Midlands and by conducting periodic supervison.The  is  from the Public Information Center.

(CAPSA or the Company)Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders	CAPSA is owned equally by the Götz, Etchepare and Bachiochi families.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	CAPSAs total financial needs are about US$70 million required to finance the Companys two year investment program and to restructure existing short-term debt.  It is proposed that IFC provide total financing of US$60 million: US$20 million for its own account and US$40 million for the account of participant banks.Location of project and Description of site	The Diadema field is located in the San Jorge basin in the Chubut province of Southern Argentina in a relatively remote, barren location with a low population density.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	CAPSA, the sponsor, is one of Argentinas smaller, family owned, oil and gas producers.  The Companys main area of activity is the operation of the Diadema oil field which produces some 5,500 bpd.  In addition, the Company holds 55% of CAPEX (the remaining 45% is publicly listed), which operates a 370 MW electricity generation plant utilizing the 2.45 million cubic meters per day output of CAPEXs Agua del Cajón and Senillosa gas fields in Neuquen.	The project to be financed is designed nearly to double daily oil production in the Diadema field through the extension of CAPSAs secondary recovery program.  The investment will finance a comprehensive drilling and workover program as well as the construction of various surface facilities.	Given the difficulty that smaller Argentine companies have in accessing the international capital markets, it is unlikely that CAPSA would be able to develop the Diadema field to its optimum recovery level without IFC assistance.  IFCs presence is required to attract the long-term finance necessary and prudent to enable CAPSA to weather the oil recovery and price risks inherent in the project.  This project would contribute to the development of second tier firms in the country while improving provincial industrial development.  Increased production of oil would generate export earnings and provide tax and royalty revenues for Chubut province which has few other income generation opportunities.  The project will also create some employment opportunities, directly with CAPSA as well as with its suppliers and contractors.  Finally, the Company would benefit from IFCs institution building effort which would help it move towards becoming a more mature and better balanced competitor.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  Environmental issues of potential concern with this project are the prevailing environmental conditions as a result of existing operations, the management of produced water and gas, the rehabilitation of lands impacted by the secondary recovery program and worker health and safety.  The Company has provided IFC with environmental baseline studies of its existing operations in order to demonstrate compliance with Government of Argentina environmental requirements as well as with World Bank environmental guidelines.  Detailed plans have been proposed for the management of produced water and gas (it is proposed, inter alia, that 6,000 m3/day of produced water will be re-injected), the rehabilitation of disturbed areas and worker health and safety.The  is  from the Public Information Center.Host country location of environmental documentsCompañías Asociadas Petroleras S.A., Avenida Eduardo Madero 940, 1106 Buenos Aires, ArgentinaDate SPI sent to PIC May 13, 1996For Additional Information contact:  Corporate Relations Unit -telephone: (202) 473-7711facsimile: (202) 676-0365Environmental documents for this project are available at http://www.ifc.org and from the World Bank InfoShop (http://www.worldbank.org/html/pic/aboutinfo.html).","","","","","","","","","","","","","",20.0 million (USD)Product LineIFC Investment (million USD)Risk ManagementGuaranteeLoan20.0Equity* These investment figures are indicative,"","","","","","",7418,"",AB - Oil and Gas Production (Includes Development),"","","",""

IFC Guarantee: a local currency guarantee of up to US$3.0 million equivalent approximately.Location of project and Description of site	The Companys operations are located in Odienné, the largest city of Northwestern Côte dIvoire.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	SODIRO is the processing subsidiary of the Odienné-based  Multiproduits/SODIRO Group which is involved in food processing and distribution.  The devaluation of the CFA Franc has made locally grown rice more competitive and the Company hopes to capitalize of this new opportunity by modernizing and upgrading its rice milling factory to its nominal 20,000 tons per annum.  In addition, other project investments are expected to improve the efficiency of the Groups distribution network and extend agricultural support services to about 700 existing rice farmers.  The project will benefit the Ivorian economy by saving around US$3.5 million annually in hard currency rice imports, and stimulating employment and revenue generation for farmers in one of the countrys poorest regions.  This contribution is particularly significant because Odienné suffers from heavy unemployment and depopulation.  The SODIRO plant is Odiennés first and so far only industrial installation, and the project will assist in expanding and consolidating its operations. Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure. Environmental and occupational and health issue associated with this project include air emissions, solid waste recycling, safety standard, induced development, and employee training standard.  The only air emissions are dust from the rice handling and milling operations, and air filtering systems will be incorporated into the design.

The remaining 14% will be owned by family members.Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment	Total project cost is estimated at US$0.73 million equivalent.  IFC has been asked to provide a venture loan of  US$0.29 million equivalent, representing 40% of total project cost.Location of Project and Description of Site	The fish processing plant will be located in Nouakchott, not far from the artisan fishing zone.   It will be built on land owned by the company.Description of the Company and Purpose of the project	The project consists of fishing operations and fish processing.  The acquisition of two small fiberglass boats, with a capacity for a weekly catch of 3 to 6 tons of fish per boat, will allow for semi-industrial fishing.  The projected annual catch of 500 tons necessary for the production of 450 tons of high value export products should be readily attainable. However, in case of shortfalls, the balance would be bought from local fishermen at going market rates.  Fish processing will take place in a small facility, with a capacity of 600 tons per annum, built under the project and responding to European Union norms.  The proposed loan will enable IFC to help local entrepreneurs become more active in a sector that  has traditionally been dominated by foreign fishermen.  IFCs investment will help establish a small but well structured indigenous company that will use labor-intensive technology to produce high quality, high value fish.  IFCs presence will also enable MAYO FISH to obtain loan funds from local banks which are usually reluctant to finance start-up companies.	Project Development Effects : The project will have considerable developmental impact especially in terms of helping Mauritanian entrepreneurs improve their competitiveness in an industry that contributes highly to the countrys overall economy.  The project also supports the governments initiatives in developing the artisan fishing zone, which promotes semi-industrial fishing techniques having a less destructive ecological impact.  Finally the project has example value as it will help build a plant which responds to all EU norms, something that is not at the present time widely spread in Mauritania.	Environmental Category  and Issues	This is an environmental review category B project.  Environmental, health and safety issues associated with the project include recycling/disposal of used motor fluids and oils, fire protection, safety at sea, solid and liquid waste treatment and disposal, CFC-free storage, provision of personal protective equipment, general housekeeping and plant hygiene, and  compliance with all applicable Mauritanian maritime requirements.

The World Bank estimates an immediate need for 200 MW of additional generation capacity by 1997-98.  This represents over 15% of the current installed capacity.  The World Bank estimates that by the year 2000 Sri Lanka needs to add at least 500 MW of additional power generation capacity.  Hence, addressing the power shortage problem of Sri Lanka has become one of the countrys high priorities.  To this end, the Government of Sri Lanka has introduced several policy changes aimed at increasing the participation of the Private Sector in power generation.  The proposed project will be Sri Lankas first independent power producer. 	The Sri Lankan system is predominantly hydro and thus dependent upon the monsoon.  Brown-outs and load shedding are common during the summer and/or dry seasonal spells.  There is a need to increase thermal generation capacity.  The project is to build own and operate a 51MW diesel plant fueled by the locally-available heavy residual fuel oil -- a by-product generated by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation.  The World Bank maintains that the best economic use of this heavy residual fuel oil is power generation.  The plant is to consist of eight generating units, each site rated at 6.35 MW with a power factor of 0.8 logging at 11kV/50Hz.  The prime movers are 16 cylinder, 600 rpm, compression ignition engines manufactured by Deutz/MWM of GermanyEnvironmental Category and Issues	This is a Category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  Environmental issues associated with this project include air emissions and dust, traffic during construction, noise levels, effects on biota, and visual impacts.  Occupational health and safety issues include noise and general worker safety.  The sponsors have submitted an independent environmental impact assessment (EA) report.

The reconstruction and upgrading of the Highway will provide a high quality road with modern services compared to the present poor level of service. The higher quality pavement will reduce vehicle operating costs and allow travel at higher operating velocity, thus reducing travel time.  Signaling, illumination and road barriers will all increase operating safety as will the redesigned road accesses. Accidents should decrease significantly from last years 14,000.  Additional lanes near Rio and São Paulo will increase vehicle capacity and reduce congestion.  New overpasses will allow vehicles and pedestrians safe crossing of the Highway. Additional services to motorists will include emergency call boxes located at one-kilometer intervals.  A series of medical first-aid stations, with ambulance service, will be spread at approximately 70-kilometer intervals.  Emergency service vehicles will also be made available for towing disabled vehicles to the nearest service area.  The Project will employ 3000 people during the Initial Works and around 2,300 during the remainder of the project.Environmental Category and Issues	This is an environmental review category B project; principal issues are air emissions, liquid effluents, solid waste, emergency response, resettlement, and employee and public safety.  The sponsor has presented plans to address these issues and to comply with applicable governmental and World Bank requirements; key actions include measures for air pollution control and wastewater treatment, employee training, and provisions for spill prevention, traffic safety and emergency response.  The sponsor is working with the local collectives and governmental authorities to ensure that the relocation of about 200 families located in the project right-of-way is handled in a fair and equitable manner.The  is available  from the Public Information Center.Date SPI sent to PIC August 2, 1996For Additional Information contact:  Corporate Relations Unit -telephone: (202) 473-7711facsimile: (202) 676-0365Environmental documents for this project are available at http://www.ifc.org and from the World Bank InfoShop (http://www.worldbank.org/html/pic/aboutinfo.html).","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",7545,"", Utilities,"","","",""

Agrimo has purchased a warehouse, an office and staff housing in the town of Morrumbala from where it will coordinate its activities.  A site for a cotton gin and for a small farm to produce cotton for seed will also be acquired in the vicinity of Morrumbala.  Extension posts will be located in small towns near where farming will be concentrated.  Corporate offices will be located in Quelimane and a representative will be based in Maputo.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Agrimo will provide agricultural inputs, assistance and a guaranteed market for cotton produced by 25,000 or more smallholder farmers in central Mozambique.  The project concept is not new and has been implemented successfully by other companies in northern Mozambique. The price paid to smallholder farmers for cotton is established by the Government of Mozambique near the beginning of the growing season.  Seed cotton, purchased from smallholders by Agrimo, will be processed at a gin to be built by Agrimo in Morrumbala.  The Cotton will be sold to the local textile industry or exported, and the Cotton seed will be sold locally.                                                                                                                                             The project will have a significant impact on the region in view of the civil war that prevailed for the past two decades.  Most of the smallholder families are recent returnees from neighboring Malawi or from the safety of nearby villages and almost all live in extreme poverty.  Agrimo will provide smallholder families with the means to diversify their risk of producing only traditional food crops and add an alternative source of income.  IFC''s role is to provide scarce equity and term-loan finance to make the project a reality.  The project is extremely important for the redevelopment of the area due to the large number of families that will benefit when the project is fully implemented.Environmental Category and Issues		This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure.  Environmental issues associated with the project include agricultural extension services, waste disposal, worker exposure to dust, general employee health and safety, and fire protection.

Location of project and Description of site	The Project is located in an industrial zone located near Baku.  The site is a land area of 4.2 hectares located near a good and plentiful water supply and a reliable power source, with easy access to Baku market.  The available space provides adequate space for production and warehouse facilities (8,200 m2), administrative offices(1,500 m2), water storage and parking, plus room for future growth for the addition of a second line.  Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Baku Coca-Cola Bottlers Ltd. was established in Azerbaijan in July 1994 and has been importing and distributing Coca-Cola products (Coke, Fanta, Sprite and Cappy) in the Baku Region.  In September 1995, the Company concluded a lease agreement for a site for a bottling facility near the City of Baku.  A tender for the construction of a bottling facility with an annual capacity of 60 million liters, based on 3 shifts, was finalized in February 1996.	The new bottling plant will be an state-of-the art facility located five miles outside of Baku and within a few miles of a high quality municipal water source.  The plant which is nearly 70% completed, is expected to commence commercial production in  September 1996.   	Azerbaijans local production of non-alcoholic beverages currently accounts for less than 5% of the market.  Imports from Turkey, Russia, Iran and Dubai make up the majority of beverage products sold on the local market.  The project will enable the Company to produce Coca-Cola products locally, and at a cost of 50% of its current imported cost.   Much of the cost savings will be will be passed on to consumers through lower prices.  The project will also enable the Company to increase its market share from 20% to 50% of the soft drink market by capturing Coca-Colas entire market share in Azerbaijan.Environmental Category and Issues	This is an environmental review category B project.  Environmental, occupational health and safety issues associated with this project include: water supply, liquid effluent treatment, air emissions from steam boilers, solid waste disposal, potential contamination of the site from present or past uses, use of CFCs in refrigeration systems and workplace noise and safety.

The major shareholders are an employee trust, Pakistani and foreign financial institutions, IFC and local small investors.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The total project cost, including working capital and interest during construction, is US$59 million.  IFCs proposed investment is an A loan of US$10 million and a B loan of US$12 million for the account of participants.Location of project and Description of site	The project will be located at the Companys existing production site at Daharki, Sindh Province.  The site, which was initially developed in the 1960s, is on barren land with an adjacent compound for employees and a small village.Description of Company and Purpose of ProjectThe project involves the retrofitting and modernization of a natural gas based amonia and urea plant, to improve energy efficiency, reduce effluents and increase production capacity. Engro, formerly Exxon Chemical Pakistan, produces urea for the local market and is Pakistans second largest producer with a 23% market share.  The Companys original manufacturing plant, with a capacity of 268,000 mt per year of urea was built in the 1960s.  In 1991 IFC helped Engro finance an expansion and debottlenecking of the plant to 600,000 mt per year of urea, together with a management buyout of Exxon USAs controlling equity stake.  This project was completed in 1993.  Engro has since completed a further debottlenecking to 750,000 mtpy.  The Retrofit project is designed to improve the energy efficiency and environmental performance of the plant, while boosting capacity to 850,000 mt of urea per year.  IFCs role in the project will be to provide access to long term foreign currency finance and to assist the continued development of a successful locally-owned fertilizer producer. IFC will thus promote an economically viable investment which will increase energy efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of one of Pakistans largest urea producers. Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure. Environmental, health and safety issues include site location, air emissions, liquid effluent treatment, solid waste, HAZOP study and safety audit, training and emergency response and occupational health and safety policies.  The project will be carried out on Engros existing plant site and no land acquisition will be necessary.  The additional production from the plant will be carried by rail or otherwise by truck.  The facility is already in compliance with relevant air and liquid emission standards. Air emissions will be further reduced by 36% on completion of the retrofitting.  Liquid effluent will also be reduced by 20%.  There will be no significant change in generation of solid waste or of ambient noise levels. A formal HAZOP study will be carried out for the process changes and recommendations will be incorporated in the design. Current training and emergency response programs, including environmental awareness and responsibility, safety orientation, and work permit systems and other programs will be amended as required. IFC will ensure ongoing compliance with World Bank environmental, health and safety policies and guidelines during the life of the project by evaluating annual monitoring reports and by conducting periodic supervision.The  is  from the Public Information Center.Date SPI sent to PIC August 30, 1996For Additional Information contact:  Corporate Relations Unit -telephone: (202) 473-7711facsimile: (202) 676-0365Environmental documents for this project are available at http://www.ifc.org and from the World Bank InfoShop (http://www.worldbank.org/html/pic/aboutinfo.html).","","","","","","","","","","","","","",9.0 million (USD)Product LineIFC Investment (million USD)Risk ManagementGuaranteeLoan9.0Equity* These investment figures are indicative,"","","","","","",7554,"",DA - Nitrogenous Fertilizer,"","","",""

The purpose of the Project is to meet the increased demand for plastic products brought about by renewed economic growth and stability in the country, and the trend towards substitution of plastics for more traditional packaging materials.  Availability of competitively-priced monomer is a critical factor in the continued growth of polymer producers, and indirectly, in that of third-generation plastic users which account for a significant share of the domestic economy.  The proposed expansion will also reinforce Brazils international competitiveness, a key objective of the Governments privatization program, by bringing about greater economies of scale, increased efficiencies and lower operating costs at Copesul.  Environmental Category and Issues	This is a Category B Project according to the World Banks environmental standards.  The existing plant conforms with all current Brazilian and World Bank standards.  The new cracker will be built to exceed the current plants standards.  The on-site organic and inorganic primary waste water treatment facilities will be expanded to treat the increased waste water flow from the expanded capacity, and to reduce the total quantities of contaminants leaving the site for downstream treatment by SITEL.  Rio Grande state law requires that Copesul publicize both its annual request for renewal of its operating permits and its intent to seek permission to expand production.  Copesul has already commenced the public disclosure process for the expansion.  The State Environmental Department, FEPAM, issued Terms of Reference for the EIA in December 1995.

A. is controlled by Wembley S.A., a Brazilian textile holding company. Wembley owns 100% of the companys common shares and 40% of the total capital of the company. Most of the remaining shares, though publicly traded, are held by 13 equity investment funds. Wembley also has the controlling interest in Coteminas, a leading producer of domestic linen fabrics in Brazil. Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	US$ 114 million. IFC is considering a total investment of US$45 million including:  (i) an A-Loan of US$15 million; and (ii) equity/quasi-equity of US$10 million, both for its own account; and (iii) a B-Loan of US$20 million for the account of participant banks.Location of project and Description of site	The project is located in the city of Campina Grande, Paraiba State, Northeast Brazil. It is being developed on 367,000 square meters of land in the citys new industrial estate on the outskirts of the urban area. The site is adjacent to the main highway to the East and adjacent to Embratex, a spinning mill being developed by Coteminas, a sister company. Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Wentex Textil S.A. is responsible for Wembleys investments in the knitted textile segment of the industry. The project will be the companys second knitted textile plant. The first, a 62 million pieces/year T-shirt production plant in Natal (also in northeast Brazil)started production in July 1996.  The project will produce 24,000 tons/year of knitted cotton fabrics for the domestic market. The fabrics will be offered to local apparel manufacturers at much lower prices than is now possible due to inefficiencies in the industry. Environmental Category and Issues	Category B. The main issues include air emissions, liquid effluents, solid wastes, fire safety, and employee protection from noise and dust. The plant will recycle water to minimize usage.  An in-house biological effluent plant will provide effluent quality within the World Banks guidelines. The Industrial estates effluent lagoon will provide additional polishing for effluent from the project. No metal based pigments will be used by the project. Cotton waste will be recycled or sold to other users. Sludge from the effluent plant will be  used as fertilizer or delivered to the citys landfills together with non-recyclable waste. Fire safety measures will include fire extinguishers, water hydrants and hoses, and emergency exits. Air filtering and temperature and humidity control will reduce the level of cotton dust and where necessary  workers will wear masks to reduce  exposure to dust and hearing protection in noisy sections. On-site doctors will provide constant care and carry out regular health checks on all employees.

This project also supports Chinas on-going reform process and would enable IFC to make a meaningful contribution to the development of financial markets in China. The IFC funding would encourage the development of non-state financial intermediaries such as OFC into competitive, market-based institutions, offering a more comprehensive alternative to public sector institutions in the provision of term financing in the local market.  Such new non-state sector financial intermediaries are expected to focus on small and medium-scale enterprises and to provide a greater range of financial services to local non-state businessesEnvironmental Category and Issues	This is a Financial Intermediary category (FI) project according to IFCs environmental review procedure. For relevant operations, the financial intermediary will be required to implement an environmental review system consistent with the Chinese governments requirements and the World Banks policies. In addition, IFC will assess the intermediaries capabilities to implement the system.

Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The total Project cost is US$389.6 million.  IFCs proposed investment amounts to US$290 million, consisting of an A Loan of US$30 million and a B Loan of US$260 million.  The B Loan would consist of two tranches: (i) a US$90 million tranche payable in four years, and (ii) a US$170 million tranche payable in nine years.  The first tranche will be used towards restructuring part of the Companys short-term debt.Location of project and Description of site	Expansion of IPQs production facilities at Triunfo (37 miles from Porto Alegre in the state of Rio Grande do Sul) to install: (i) a high-density polyethylene (HDPE)/linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) swing plant with a capacity of 150,000 metric tonnes per year (tpy), and (ii) a polypropylene (PP) plant with a capacity of 150,000 tpy.  The Triunfo complex comprises the Copesul naphtha cracker at the core of the facility and six second generation producers, in addition to IPQ.  The site is well-connected by road with the major market centers of the São Paulo/Rio de Janeiro and Montevideo/Buenos Aires areas. Description of Company and Purpose of Project	IPQ is a producer of HDPE, with a domestic market share of about 35%.  HDPE is a plastic resin used in a wide number of household and industrial applications.  IPQs facilities consist of two HDPE plants with a nameplate capacity of 220,000 tpy.  The Company is in the process of completing the construction of a third HDPE plant with an additional capacity of 135,000 tpy. The plant is expected to come on stream in early 1997.  IPQ proposes to expand its capacity further in response to an increase in Brazilian and Conesul demand brought about by strong GDP growth and low inflation following the implementation of the Real Plan in 1994, and the greater economic integration of the Conesul region.  The proposed expansion will allow IPQ to benefit from the diversification of its product range and to access new end-use application sectors, thereby increasing IPQs competitiveness by bringing about greater economies of scale and lower operating costs.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a Category B Project according to the IBRDs environmental standards.  The existing plant conforms with all current Brazilian and IBRD standards.  The Project will not create any air emissions under normal operation.  For emergency cases and venting under process disturbances the facility is equipped with a flare.  In common with the Companys existing plants, the organic and inorganic effluents generated by the Project will be pre-treated on-site to remove oil and grease and to ensure consistent concentrations in the effluent before it is transferred to SITEL (the central wastewater treatment plant for the Triunfo complex).  Solid waste, other than polymers separated from water streams and sold to licensed companies for reuse, will not increase significantly.  IPQ has carried out public information/consultation for the expansion project based on Brazilian regulation.

IFC is proposing to invest up to US$25.0 million in the project, including an A loan of US$12.0 million, a B loan of US$8.0 million, and equity of up to US$5.0 million equivalent.Location of project and Description of site	The project will be located in Ploesti, the capital city of Prahova county, approximately 60 km north of Bucharest.  The site is a 12 hectare plot of land on the outskirts of Ploesti.  It is adjacent to a railway network with good access to all parts of Romania, as well as the main road linking Ploesti to Bucharest.  Adequate water will be available from the municipal water system of Ploesti and from wells which will be drilled on the site.   Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The project is to construct and operate a brewery in Romania, with an initial production capacity of 750,000 hl per year.  The brewery will be owned by Romanian Efes Brewery SA, a Romanian company controlled by the Efes Group.  The brewery will be constructed over a two-year period, incorporating modern brewing and packaging technology.  Compared with beer from the countrys existing breweries, the projects beer will be more hygienically produced, will be of more consistent quality, and will have a longer shelf-life.  A modern distribution system will also be developed, combining both direct delivery and the use of exclusive wholesalers.                                                                                                                                          The economic rationale for the project is to supply good quality beer to the Romanian market at the lowest possible economic cost.  Given that the cost of transporting beverages is high relative to their value, the economic cost of producing these products locally is lower than the alternative of importation.  This economic saving will also lead to a reduction in retail prices of quality beer in the country, which will benefit consumers.  Furthermore, the project will have a positive development impact in the country by generating employment, by increasing skill levels in the workforce, and by developing the countrys business infrastructure, including distribution, wholesale and retail networks.  Overall, the project will assist the countrys transformation from a command, supply-driven economy towards one that is service-oriented and market-driven.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure; principal issues include water supply, liquid effluent treatment, air emissions, solid waste reuse and disposal, potential contamination of site from present or past uses, potential use of CFCs, fire and explosion prevention, and workplace health and safety.  Steam boilers at the brewery will be operated with low sulfur fuel to minimize sulfur dioxide emissions.  A new wastewater treatment facility will be installed such that liquid effluents will meet the respective Romanian standards and the World Bank guidelines.  The company will clean and reuse all types of product containers.  The site has not been contaminated by either present or past uses.  Ammonia will be used as the refrigerant for central cooling systems.  Fire protection programs will be implemented to meet local requirements and World Bank guidelines.

(7.5%).  It is proposed that IFC acquire a 3.5% equity interest which would reduce Amsas shareholding to 81.5%.  Amsa is also the project technical partner.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Project cost is US$430.0 million including all associated infrastructure and capitalized interest.  IFCs proposed investment is - (i) A loan - US$65 million, (ii) B loan - US$50 million and (iii) Equity - US$9.455 million.Location of project and Description of site	The Project is located in Venezuelas Miranda and Aragua States, some 80 kms south-west of Caracas, close to electric power, natural gas and paved roads and within 200 kms of the ocean port of Puerto Cabello.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The Project involves the commercial development of the Loma de Niquel lateritic nickel deposit 80 km southwest of Caracas, the installation of an on-site ferro nickel smelter to process ores from the mine, and the construction of associated infrastructure facilities including an access road, a water reservoir and a 17 km gas pipeline.  The Project is based on proven and probable ore reserves of 34 million tonnes, which is sufficient for a mine life of 27 years with an average production of nickel in ferro nickel of around 16,000 tonnes per year over the life of the Project with a peak production of 18,800 tonnes in 2001.  The Project will help Venezuela to diversify from its reliance on the oil industry and will enable the private sector to extend its reach into the mining business. The Project is expected to contribute substantial returns to Venezuela in terms of tax revenues, foreign exchange earnings and employment (direct employment will be 600 Venezuelans).  IFCs role is to provide, and attract, through the B loan mechanism, long term financing which may otherwise be unavailable to this viable, long term project.  Environmental Category and Issues	This a category A project under IFCs environmental review procedure because potentially diverse and significant adverse impacts on the environment may occur.  The ore body is grassland on the south crest of a long ridge.  There is no reported use of the project site for grazing or agricultural purposes because of the poor soils and grass growth.  Reclamation plans include backfilling, which will begin about 3-4 years after mining begins.  At the end of the project, overburden from the first 3-4 years will be deposited in the last pit area.  The mine is designed to be a zero discharge facility.  The nickel refinery will not generate tailings, but will generate a slag that is neither toxic nor acid-generating. Drainage from the slag heap, as well as cooling water from the refinery and drainage from the waste dump and low-grade ore stockpile, will be collected and reclaimed for process water.  Emissions (particulates and dust from stacks or stockpiles) will be tightly controlled, and all particulates will be collected and pelletized for reprocessing as ore material.  Under Venezuelan law, an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was prepared on the project.  The EIA was prepared as part of the feasibility study, and played a role in project concept and design. The EIA consultants worked with local people as information sources, and held meetings with local community groups during EIA preparation.  Following preparation of the EIA, local meetings were held in the nearby community municipal offices.

The remaining 20% is owned by Societe Nationale des Hydrocarbures (SNH), the Cameroonian national oil company.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The additional financing requirement will be US$115 million. It is proposed that IFC will provide some US$95 million, US$20 million for its own account and US$75 million for the account of participants.Location of project and Description of site	The project is located in seven oil fields in the Rio del Rey Basin, offshore Cameroon.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Pecten and Elf Serepca (which is owned 20% by SNH and 80% by Elf Aquitaine) are joint operators in a number of concessions which account for over 95% of Cameroon''s oil production.  The purpose of the Project is to improve recovery from mature fields by slowing down the production decline and thereby extending their useful economic life.  In 1990, Pecten was able to arrange financing on the international markets, independently of IFC.  Since then however, the international banking community has made it clear that it would no longer finance further development in Cameroon without IFCs participation to mitigate perceived political risks.  This continues to be the case today.  At the same time, the proposed financing is vital to ensure the optimal exploitation of the Republics most important oilfields.      In order to avoid transfer pricing difficulties and because the Republic prefers not to pay its share of development expenses up-front, Pecten seeks financing for development expenditure through external debt.  The Republics share of debt service is then reimbursed out of its share of oil revenues.      IFC intends to raise up to about 80% of the additional debt financing from external sources.  With IFC as the catalyst, this Project will be able to mobilize significant funds in a country with a high level of perceived political risk.	Cameroon is sub-Saharan Africas fifth largest oil producer and oil accounts for a large proportion of government revenue. The direct benefits of this Project to Cameroon are considerable as the Republic receives a large proportion of after tax operating income from production, as well as dividends. The project will therefore generate a significant amount of additional foreign exchange earnings for the country.  Oil remains of major importance to the economy and the full exploitation of the Republics reserves remains a major component of its continued economic development.      In order to address the decline in oil production which is expected as current reserves are fully exploited, the Republic has introduced measures to encourage private sector participation in the development of fields that are considered marginal.  Measures have also been instituted to incentivize private sector entities to explore for new sources of exploitable reserves.  Part of the development portion of the Project is directed at such marginal fields while the exploration portion will largely be directed at the so-called exploration incentive fields.  The Project will thus support these initiatives by assisting in the stabilization of the Republics overall oil production profile.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B Project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure.  Environmental issues of potential concern with this project include the discharge of drilling muds and cuttings, treatment and disposal of produced water and other liquid effluents, gas flaring and oil spill contingency plans and response capability.  Based on environmental monitoring reports and other information submitted by Pecten, IFC has concluded that the continued development of the fields is designed to meet World Bank environmental, health and safety policies and guidelines, and host country requirements.The  is  from the Public Information Center.Host country location of environmental documentsInternational Finance Corporation, Rue Flatters, B.P. 4616, Doula, CameroonDate SPI sent to PIC January 9, 1997For Additional Information contact:  Corporate Relations Unit -telephone: (202) 473-7711facsimile: (202) 676-0365Environmental documents for this project are available at http://www.ifc.org and from the World Bank InfoShop (http://www.worldbank.org/html/pic/aboutinfo.html).","","","","","","","","","","","","","",20.0 million (USD)Product LineIFC Investment (million USD)Risk ManagementGuaranteeLoan20.0Equity* These investment figures are indicative,"","","","","","",7621,"",AB - Oil and Gas Production (Includes Development),"","","",""

All of the three companies have been owned and controlled by Mr. Enrique Kleppe. The group has recently decided to concentrate its corporate  activities on the fruit business and sell the soft drink operations. As part of this effort, Neuquen Refrescos has been sold and El Caldero S.A. is being merged with Kleppe S.A. Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Project cost is estimated at US$12 million. IFC is considering an A loan of US$6 million.Location of project and Description of site	The project is located in the central region of the Rio Negro valley, an area with a low level of resource utilization and where arid land is being recuperated through irrigation by the Company. The project is the main employer in the region of Coronel Belisle, and has contributed significantly to its development area as the main fruit producing area in Argentina.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Kleppe, an existing IFC client located in Rio Negro Province in Argentina, is undertaking an investment program  with the following main elements: divestiture of the groups soft drinks bottling business and focus on the fruit production and marketing activities, merger and streamlining of the remaining fruit related companies, expansion of fruit plantations, as well as cold storage and packing facilities. The expansion would be achieved through capacity increases in the various facilities, and to a smaller degree acquisitions of existing plantations.  The expansion program would strengthen one of the important integrated fruit operations in Argentina, thus protecting and generating employment, including creation of significant seasonal employment for fruit pickers from Tucuman province. Kleppe, as one of the companies on the leading edge of the fruit sector in the Rio Negro valley, would continue to stimulate development of the sector and help increase exports and generation of foreign exchange. 	The project is consistent with several priorities in IFCs strategy in Argentina. First, IFC would provide long-term funding to a family owned, mid-size company. In Kleppe, IFC would support a company that is rather small compared to the overall profile, at least in Latin America. In the proposed transaction, IFC would continue to make a special effort to work with a client that, despite its business potential and development impact, would have no access to long term funding in Argentina because it is a relatively small company. Therefore, IFC support would be critical to help this program get off the ground. Second, IFCs support will help increase the export of high value agricultural products and diversity Argentinas export base.Finally, both IFC and IBRD have identified supporting economic development in the interior of Argentina as a priority. An IBRD adjustment loan to support provincial reforms was approved by the Board earlier this year, and IFC has been working closely with the Bank in assisting to privatize some provincial enterprises. In December 1995, the Board approved an investment in Ceramica Zanon S.A. located also in the Neuquen-Cipoletti metropolitan area and the largest industrial employer there.Environmental Category and Issues	The project is a Category B project under the IFCs environmental guidelines.  The company''s program for mitigating negative environmental impacts has been approved by the Environmental Unit.  This includes integrated pest management practices in the farms; correct training of workers in the use of pesticides, provision of protective clothing and regular medical supervision; treatment of the packing house effluent before discharge into the municipal sewer system to the required standards acceptable to the municipality.

The Project site itself is 19 ha, and is adjacent to the polypropylene plant.  Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The Project consists of the construction and operation of a greenfield polyethylene plant with a capacity of 250,000 tpy, to produce a wide range of linear low-density (LLDPE) and high-density (HDPE) products.  The Philippines currently has no domestic polyethylene production capacity, and domestic demand is met by imports.  Pending the construction of a naphtha cracker in the Philippines, which is currently under consideration, the Project will rely initially on imported ethylene.  The Project is scheduled to be commissioned in the third quarter of 1999. The petrochemical sector in the Philippines is still at a formative stage.  Despite a reasonably strong level of demand, the industry has not expanded historically due to (i) non-availability of feedstock; (ii) a limited availability of equity financing; and (iii) until recently, slow or stagnant economic growth.  Since 1992, with the overall improvement in the countrys economic conditions resulting from macroeconomics stabilization and structural reform policy measures undertaken by the Ramos Government, private investment and exports have boomed.  The Government has earmarked the petrochemical sector as a priority industry.  The Project forms part of a larger initiative to create the countrys first integrated petrochemical complex consisting of second generation polymer producers and eventually an olefins cracker.    Environmental Category and Issues	The Project has been rated Category A according to the World Banks environmental guidelines.   The Philippine Petrochemical Development Corporation (PPDC) has completed an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study for the entire petrochemical park, which has been reviewed by IFCs Environmental Unit.  The Environment Monitoring Board (EMB) of the Philippines has approved PPDCs submission, and has cleared the Project.  In addition, a Project-specific EIA, a plant monitoring program including occupational health and safety, and compliance statements establishing compliance with the World Bank and local guidelines were completed by BPC and reviewed by IFCs Environment unit.  The site visit by IFCs Environmental Specialist is planned for mid-March.  BPC will carry out hazard and operability (HAZOP) studies for the Project on a continual basis throughout implementation, and  will ensure that all HAZOP recommendations as applicable are complied with before commissioning.	Prior to the establishment of the park, the 550 ha of land owned by PPDC was occupied by about 380 informal dwellers who are in the process of being compensated and resettled in a new housing development adjacent to the site.  However, all 7 of the irregular settlers on BPCs site have been compensated and resettled.  The resettlement was undertaken by the PPDC, a government agency, after comprehensive public consultations and the compensation plan was successfully implemented.  The Project site was handed over to BPC by PPDC after the completion of the resettlement program.  BPC has agreed to undertake additional public consultation during the implementation and operation of the Project.  A separate monitoring plan has been developed by BPC and reviewed by IFCs environmental unit.

Messer Gases Dikheila Company S.A.E.,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Middle East and North Africa,"Egypt, Arab Republic of","Messer Gases Dikheila Company, S.A.E.",Regional Industry - MAS Africa,1997-03-28T05:00:00Z,"",B,Loan,"Summary Of Project Information (SPI)Project NameEgypt-Industrial Gas CenterRegionCentral Asia, Middle East and North AfricaSectorProject No008006Projected Board DateMay 17, 1997Company NameMesser Gases Dikheila (MGD)Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders	The main sponsors are Messer Griesheim (MG), a German company, and Alexandria National Iron and Steel Co.(ANSDK), an Egyptian integrated steel mill, which would own respectively 45% and 35% of MGD.  MG is majority owned by Hoechst AG and is one of the leading global industrial gases companies.  ANSDK, an IFC client, is a profitable and internationally competitive producer of steel rebars. Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Project Cost of US$20.3 million (including an IFC A loan of US$4 million and an equity investment of about US$1.2 million equivalent representing up to 10% of MGDs capital)Location of project and Description of site	 MGD will build and operate an air-separation plant and a cylinder filling station in El-Dikheila, 15 kms west of Alexandria. It would also invest in distribution equipment and road tankers.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The project consists of setting up MGD, which would have a capacity of 2,000 Nm3/hr of oxygen, 4,300 Nm3/hr of nitrogen and 70 Nm3/hr of argon.  MGD would supply ANSDK and the market in proximity to the plant.  Sales to ANSDK would take place under a long term supply contract and would absorb an important portion of  MGDs output. MGDs remaining output would be sold to smaller customers in the Alexandria area benefiting from low transportation cost.	This is MGs first industrial gas project in the Middle East. The project will contribute to expand and increase competition in the Egyptian industrial gas market which is currently dominated by a public sector company with about 40-50% market share. This is expected to result in a reduction in prices.       IFC is viewed as a neutral third party between MG and ANSDK and this would be useful for the smooth running of MGD.  Also, IFC intends to work closely with the sponsors to pursue a public offering of 10% of the MGDs capital. This will not only broaden MGDs ownership but also have a demonstration effect in Egypt as it would be the first public offering for a greenfield project.Environmental Category and Issues		This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure. The project does not produce undesirable emissions or effluents. Environmental, occupational health and safety issues associated with this project include: hazard assessment, employee exposure to the presence of high pressure gases and heavy steel cylinders, equipment safeguarding, fire prevention and emergency response.  The sponsors have presented plans to address these issues and demonstrate that the proposed project will comply with applicable governmental and World Bank requirements. Key actions include:                                                                                         A hazard assessment (Hazop) plan is in place at the facility, that includes the source of hazard associated with the handling of chemicals, and the circumstances and situations in which accidents are possible.  The general safety at the facility will be designed according to international rules and regulations.  These regulations apply not only to the design of equipment, but also to the regulations of accident prevention.  The electrical equipment, pressure vessels, tanks and pipes will be grounded.  Occasional rupture of pressure bearing vessels and pipes will be minimized by providing accurate design of the pressure system via safety valves.  The spill of liquid gases by rupture of hoses between tanks and trucks will be prevented by dead man protection circuits, which stops the supply pumps immediately when the operator leaves the pump.  Personnel will be trained on the job during installations and checking of equipment.  A fire protection and life safety plan as required by the local fire department will be implemented.  Extinguishers and other fire fighting equipment will be installed and placed according to the fire department recommendations.

Eleya Ould Saleck and Mohamed H. Bouamatou, two successful Mauritanian entrepreneurs who would like to diversify their business interests to include fish processing and exports.  Messrs. Saleck and Bouamatou own each 35% of STEPs UM 30 million share capital, with the balance divided among a few members of their family.Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment:	 Total project cost of is estimated at US$1.7 million financed by equity and a loan from IFC.  IFC''s investment would amount to US$0.843 million or 48% of total project cost.Location of the Project and Description of the Site:  The project would be located at the Nouakchott fishing harbor.  Access to the project site will be by asphalt road.  The processing plant will be built on a 1,943 square meter plot owned by the sponsors and will cover an area of 562 square meters.  It will have two cold store units, a chill room, a blast freezer, an ice machine, an ice silo, a fish reception room, and two processing rooms.  Additionally, there will be an amenities room, including sanitary facilities for the workers and an office block for the administrative staff.Description of Company and Purpose of Project:	STEP is a newly established Mauritanian company which intends to set up a modern fish processing plant in the vicinity of Nouakchott fishing harbor to process and export both fish and frozen fish products mainly to EU countries.  The Company will charter two ice-keeping vessels which are expected to produce an estimated 1,210 t of fish annually.  The remaining raw fish will be procured from artisanal fishermen.  At full capacity, the plant is expected to produce 1,543 t of fresh and frozen seafood per annum.  In addition, the Company will produce 1,375 t of ice per annum, of which 757 t will be sold to the public.Development Impact: The project will have considerable development impact by helping Mauritanian entrepreneurs improve their competitiveness and play a bigger role in an industry which is key to the local economy.  In addition, the project will build a plant which responds to all EU safety norms, and will support the Government''s efforts to promote artisanal fishing, which has been limited by the lack of modern infrastructure.  The fish sector contributes significantly to both export and Government revenues in Mauritania.  With annual export revenues of US$5.6 million, the STEP project would contribute to strengthening the country''s balance of payments.  The project would also contribute an estimated US$6.0 million to Government revenues in terms of taxes and duties over eight years.  Moreover, the project would create 48 new jobs at full capacity.IFC''s Role:  The IFC investment would help a local entrepreneur diversify into the export of fish products, an important economic activity for Mauritania.  IFC has played an important role in verifying the technical aspects of the project during appraisal.  Moreover, IFC is helping the sponsor find an experienced Production Manager to train Mauritanian workers on quality requirements for international markets as well as processing and packaging techniques.  Finally, IFCs loan will complete the financial structure of the project, and provide longer term financing than that of local banks.Environmental Issues:	This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedures. Environmental issues associated with this project include fish resource sustainability, safety at sea, water and power supply, liquid and solid waste disposal, CFC-free cold storage, noise levels, employee safety including protective equipment and plant hygiene and fire protection.

Wadi Holdings specializes mainly in the poultry business, but is also involved in the production of olives and olive oil. Messrs. Freiji and Nasrallah, shareholders of Wadi Holdings with 75% and 25% of the shares respectively, are also the shareholders of ADC, in the same proportion.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The four-year investment program is estimated at US$20 million, of which, IFC is considering a US$6 million A Loan.Location of project and Description of site	ADCs existing facilities, including the parent farms, the feed mill, and the hatchery, are all located in Zahle, the capital of the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon. All three sites are positioned in isolated zones, with at least 1 km separation between each other and from the nearest public road. 	ADC has also identified and bought in the Bekaa similarly isolated land parcels to construct its additional facilities. These include eight broiler farms of 30,000 m2 each, and the processing plant which will be built on a 20,000 m2 site at one hour proximity of the broiler farms, to reduce bird-weight losses during transportation.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The project is to rehabilitate and expand the existing facilities of Agricultural Development Co. (ADC), which currently include three broiler parent farms, a modern hatchery and a feed plant, into an integrated broiler meat production facility. The project will be located in the Bekaa valley of Lebanon and will have the capacity to produce over 9,600 tpy of broiler meat. The US$20 million investment program, to be carried out over two years, includes (i) the full rehabilitation of ADCs existing facilities, (ii) the construction and equipment of eight broiler farms, (iii) the setup of an administration and service center, (iv) the setup of a broiler meat processing plant, and (v) the setup of a distribution and sales center.  The Project will promote the introduction of the integrated meat processing concept and help satisfy the increasing demand for broiler meat in Lebanon, lessening the countrys dependence on the imports of such products. The project will promote technology transfer by importing the latest meat processing technology and training Lebanese nationals in international quality management, operational, marketing and sales skills. With its modern facility and experienced management team, the Company is expected to be the low-cost producer in Lebanon and provide higher quality products at competitive prices. The project would also serve as a platform for a broader development impact, as contract farming could be introduced at a subsequent phase, thus providing significant and stable employment opportunities to small and medium sized farmers who would supplement the Companys own production, within acceptable performance indicators and costs. Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure. Environmental, occupational, and health issues associated with this project include air emissions, solid waste management, liquid effluents, safe handling of food, and general employee training, health and safety. The following measures are considered by ADC to address these issues:i) Air Emissions:	 As part of the project, gas cleaning/filtering systems will be installed and rendering units will be fitted with deodorizers to reduce smell. ii) Solid Waste Management: Solid wastes from farming operations will be collected at the end of each farming cycle and sold to local farmers for use as fertilizer. Because of the extensive farming land in the Bekaa valley there is no risk from over-application of manure, and the system has a natural balance, in that, nutrients added are all taken up in crop growth. Solid waste from the processing plant will be treated at rendering facilities to produce animal feed.  iii) Liquid Effluents: All liquid effluents will be discharged to a treatment plant which will be constructed as an integral part of the processing plant. ADC will bring all its effluents in compliance with both local requirements and World Bank guidelines. iv) Food Handling: ADC will provide protective gear and appropriate training to all its employees. In addition, employees who will work at the processing plant will be provided with continued training and supervision to ensure adequate food handling.  v) General Employee Health and Safety: Employee occupational health and safety issues will be addressed through training associated with job responsibilities, general training in fire protection and safety, and periodic safety seminars. Workers will receive safety training and will be supplied with protective clothing and headgear. There will be a first aid center on premises. Also, all ADCs facilities will be equipped with a canteen and kitchen areas available to staff. vi) IFC will ensure ongoing compliance with World Bank guidelines during the life of the project by evaluating monitoring reports submitted annually to IFC by the Company and by conducting periodic supervision.The  is  from the Public Information Center.Date SPI sent to PIC April 9, 1997For Additional Information contact:  Corporate Relations Unit -telephone: (202) 473-7711facsimile: (202) 974-4384Environmental documents for this project are available at http://www.ifc.org and from the World Bank InfoShop (http://www.worldbank.org/html/pic/aboutinfo.html).","","","","","","","","","","","","","",5.0 million (USD)Product LineIFC Investment (million USD)Risk ManagementGuaranteeLoan5.0Equity* These investment figures are indicative,"","","","","","",7676,"",AG - Animal Slaughtering and Processing,"","","",""

Terminal 6 serves as the port facility through which the sponsors export their pelletized meal after crushing.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The estimated project cost is US$24.8 million, including civil works, equipment, contingencies, value added tax, working capital and financing fees. IFC''s proposed investment would include an A loan of US$10 million and a B loan of US$11 million.Location of project and Description of site	Terminal 6 is an agricultural port and storage facility located in the San Martin area approximately 450 km north of the mouth of the Paraná river. The terminal has 56 hectares of land, 1 berthing facility for 80,000 DWT vessels, a barge pier, 7 flat-floor silos, 10 concrete vertical silos, a rail unloading station, 2 truck unloading stations and ancillary office buildings, workshops and a laboratory.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The project consists of the expansion of the port facility to accomodate additional volumes from a new 4,800 ton per day soybean crushing plant located adjacent to the port. Major civil works would comprise the construction of 2 additional flat-floor and 34 vertical storage silos and the construction of an additional berth.  Terminal 6 currently handles an estimated 4 million tons of oilseed by-products and grains annually, with the bulk of its throughput provided by its sponsor companies and the remainder by third parties. The aim of the project is to increase Terminal 6''s storage and loading capacity to accomodate new volumes from a proposed crushing plant located adjacent to the port. IFC''s Agribusiness Department is considering the financing of the new crushing plant, T6 Industrial, which will be owned by Terminal 6''s shareholders. Given the current efficiency of the port terminal and its proximity to the crushing plant, the project would contribute to the creation of a highly competitive soybean crushing complex.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure. Principal issues include: air emissions, liquid effluents, solid wastes, spill prevention, fire prevention, emergency response, and employee exposure to noise and dust. Dust emissions due to the handling of grain or oil extracted meals are controlled with suction systems that convey the dust to cyclone separators, where it is reclaimed. Stormwater and washwater effluent can contain grain dust but no toxic substances are employed in the products handled. Fire prevention is designed into the plant through the selection of sealed and anti-static equipment and through housekeeping and operating practices.The  is  April 9, 1997 from the Public Information Center.Date SPI sent to PIC April 8, 1997For Additional Information contact:  Corporate Relations Unit -telephone: (202) 473-7711facsimile: (202) 676-0365Environmental documents for this project are available at http://www.ifc.org and from the World Bank InfoShop (http://www.worldbank.org/html/pic/aboutinfo.html).","","","","","","","","","","","","","",10.0 million (USD)Product LineIFC Investment (million USD)Risk ManagementGuaranteeLoan10.0Equity* These investment figures are indicative,"","","","","","",7962,"",BB - Port and Harbor Operations,"","","",""

The 20-year exploration and mining lease granted to Somisy in March 1989 covers an area of approximately 376 square km.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The Somisy mine was developed in two phases, with Phase 1 being the open-pit mining and processing of oxide ore, and Phase 2 the open-pit mining and processing of sulfide ore.  Phase I incorporated conventional Carbon-in-Leach (CIL) extraction technology and Phase II involved the construction of a roaster to treat the sulfide ore prior to cyanidation. IFC made an equity and shareholder loan investment in 1991 to assist with the financing of phase II.  IFCs existing investment is a 15% equity ownership and a US$26.8 million shareholder loan to Somisy.                                                                                The sulfide plant was completed in 1994 but has experienced technical difficulties such that it has yet to reach full operating capacity.  These difficulties resulted from a combination of factors, including incorrect ore test results and inadequate design and have led to reduced gold output and higher than anticipated operating costs. Randgold, which recently purchased BHPs 65% Somisy interest, has developed an extensive plan to overcome the technical problems and to increase gold production and reduce operating costs.                                                                                                                                                                            The project will be implemented in two phases at a cost of US$64 million and is designed to relieve technical constraints and expand the ore processing plant to 2.5 million tons per annum. Somisys mining capacity will remain the same, although mining equipment will be upgraded and replaced. The modifications to the processing plant will allow medium grade ore to be processed when mined, rather than stockpiled as at present. Gold production capacity is projected to increase from 190,000 to 270,000 ounces per annum.  Randgold has also proposed that IFC swap two thirds of its equity interest in Somisy(i.e. 10%) and two thirds of its shareholder loan to Somisy for a shareholding in Randgold.                                                                                                                                            The proposed investment will have a strong positive development impact as resource development remains a key component of Malian economic development. Gold output and exports will expand, generating net foreign exchange earnings for the country and taxation returns in the form of royalties, taxes and profit share.  The project is consistent with overall Bank objectives of private sector led resource development in Mali.  IFC will provide long term financing which would otherwise be unavailable to the project.  Additionally, IFC will, through its B loan mechanism, attract long term financing from international commercial banks.  Environmental Category and Issues	This is an environmental review category B project.  The following potential environmental impacts of the project were analyzed: surface water quality and wastewater/effluents management; air emissions including dust control; tailings disposal and sediment control; water supply and hydrological impacts; storage and handling of chemicals; solid waste management; and rehabilitation planning and land reclamation.  Social issues are public consultation and company disclosure policy and proper management of the interaction between the mine personnel, government and local population.  Occupational health and safety (HS) issues include health, training and awareness and general worker safety.  An Environmental Audit of the Syama gold mine and ore processing plant was submitted to IFC.  The audit includes a comprehensive project description, a summary of the natural environment baseline information, an assessment of the policy, legal and administrative framework, a review of the environmental impacts of the proposed improvements/changes linked with the capital expenditure program and a discussion of the audit results including detailed recommendations.  The existing operation meets World Bank guidelines, and many of the proposed improvements will address matters that have been identified by the new owners in their audit of the environmental performance of the existing facilities.  Randgold will implement a monitoring plan and mitigation measures to reduce various impacts.  IFC will monitor ongoing compliance with World Bank environmental, health and safety policies and guidelines. As a potential new shareholder in Randgold, IFC also carried out a review of the Companys Environmental Policies and Management System.  Randgolds investments are operated in an environmentally responsible manner, with a clear Environmental Management Mission Statement, committing to the integration of environmental management into all aspects and stages of their business activities.The  is  from the Public Information Center.Date SPI sent to PIC April 8, 1997For Additional Information contact:  Corporate Relations Unit -telephone: (202) 473-7711facsimile: (202) 676-0365Environmental documents for this project are available at http://www.ifc.org and from the World Bank InfoShop (http://www.worldbank.org/html/pic/aboutinfo.html).","","","","","","","","","","","","","",10.0 million (USD)Product LineIFC Investment (million USD)Risk ManagementGuaranteeLoan10.0Equity0.0* These investment figures are indicative,"","","","","","",7975,"",BE - Gold,"","","",""

In addition, to facilitate communication between customer sites/branches in Dar es Salaam, a Wireless Local Loop will be implemented to create a metropolitan backbone at 64/128 kbit/sec.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Datel is a joint venture between Nexus International and TTCL with a concession to establish, operate and maintain a national data communications network in Tanzania.  The project, which employs Very Small Apperture Terminal (VSAT) satellite technology upcountry, will be implemented in a gradual manner and grow to meet estimated demand of approximately 300 VSATs.  Datel began commercial operation in December 1996.	The telecommunications sector in Tanzania is extremely underdeveloped.  The present infrastructure is not able to serve the current needs for data communications due to its limited capacity, poor quality and unreliability.  The business community has indicated a need for reliable data transmission services, especially for money transactions.  Eliminating the physical transfer of money is likely to lead to increased security and confidence in the banking system, resulting in a relatively higher rate in the mobilization of domestic savings.  Moreover, improved data transmission would greatly increase overall business efficiency, thereby encouraging investment in other sectors and promoting economic growth.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  Environmental issues associated with this project include:  right-of-way alignment, tower site selection, PCBs, solid and liquid waste disposal.

IFC is also considering an equity investment (US$3 million) in the Company. The Facility would be an effective way of channeling long-term funds to financially and economically viable infrastructure projects which are too small for IFC to finance directly, through a financial intermediary with a proven track record and a strong local presence. A major constraint to private infrastructure investments in India has been the lack of necessary market mechanisms to provide funds in terms of  maturity, structure, and volume required. This is true not only of the larger infrastructure projects, but also small to medium sized projects which are wholly dependent on local financial institutions for financing.

The off-site infrastructure will be financed by the donor community led by the World Bank and USAID.  PADICO has also requested IFCs assistance in identifying a technical partner with experience in operating and managing a similar industrial estate.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The total project cost is estimated at about US$60.7 million, consisting of US$20.0 million for off-site infrastructure and US$40.7 million for on-site infrastructure and the construction of factory buildings(the Project).  IFCs investment will be a loan of about US$ 8.0 million and up to US$ 1.0 million in equity.Location of project and Description of site	The GIE is located on the border between Gaza and Israel, 3 km South of the center of Gaza City and 1 km from the main highway to Egypt. The site is well connected with the main commercial transfer points - 5 km from the proposed Gaza Port; 25 km from Gaza Airport (expected to be operational in mid-1997); 25 km from the port of Ashkalon; and 65 km from Lod International Airport in Israel.  The total size of the GIE is about 48 hectares.  The land was provided by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) under a 49 year lease agreement with PADICO.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The GIE will be developed by PADICO. PADICO was incorporated in 1993 with the main objective to develop and encourage investment in various sectors throughout the West Bank and Gaza. As of year end, 1995, PADICOs total shareholders equity was about US$58.3 million. To date, PADICO has established five subsidiaries in tourism, real estate and industrial development, telecommunications, and securities markets.  The total estimated cost of projects in PADICOs current investment program is over US$500 million.  PADICO has begun the process of establishing a new subsidiary company (Palestine Industrial Estate Development and Management Company) to operate and manage the project which consists of the construction, operation, and management of an industrial estate catering to small- medium-scale enterprises.  The project will address the critical shortage of infrastructure (water, sewage, power, etc.) for industries in Gaza and will draw on Gazas relatively low wage and productive labor force, its preferential trade arrangements with the US and EU, and the low lease for the land.  At full development, the project is expected to employ about 20,000 Palestinian workers.   IFCs developmental role consists of:  a) supporting a project that alleviates serious unemployment in Gaza and builds up Gazas trade and business potential; b) giving confidence to the private sector businesses, especially those from overseas, to locate at the site;  c) helping to complete the projects financial plan by providing funding on terms and maturities not otherwise available; d) playing a catalytic role in attracting financing from foreign sources; e) assisting PADICO to find a partner with experience in operating and managing an industrial estate; and f) creating a model for the development of future industrial estates in the West Bank and Gaza.  IFCs financing of the on-site development will be complemented by the World Bank and USAID financing for the off-site infrastructure development.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  Environmental issues associated with this project include liquid effluence, ground water resources, air emissions, and solid waste.  Health and safety issues include fire safety and emergency response.  The project will be designed to meet all local regulations as well as World Bank guidelines, and is likely to result in significant environmental benefits for Gaza as a whole by providing a well-serviced industrial estate under centralized management. An EIA for the project was completed under the supervision of USAID.

The paper mill was constructed in 1938 and upgraded over the years to produce 48,000 tons per year of unbleached kraft paper.   Description of Company and Purpose of Project	This project is the rehabilitation and modernization of Horizon Pulp & Paper Company, the only large paper company in Estonia.  The investments planned under this project are targeted to bring the company into compliance with the World Bank environmental standards, improve the quality and efficiency of the current unbleached kraft paper and sack production, and introduce limited tissue products. 	 This project will promote the development of a higher value added export oriented industry based on a local raw material which makes a significant contribution to the long-run sustainable development of the Estonian economy.  Estonia is a small country with few natural resources and a relatively small industrial base.  Timber, pulp and paper is one sector of clear comparative advantage for the country due to the relatively abundant and low cost local raw material.  However, due to the collapse of the markets and economies of the former Soviet Union (FSU) combined with the capital intensive nature of these industries and lack of local capital, the Estonian paper industry collapsed completely in the early 1990s.  As a result, currently the majority of harvested forest is exported in the form of uncut logs.  Environmental Category and Issues	This is an environmental review category B project.  The environmental, health and safety issues include forest management and sustainibility of wood supply, effluent discharges, air emissions and solid waste disposal.

Description of Company and Purpose of ProjectThe project involves the establishment of an auto ancillary fund of corpus of at least US$42 million that will focus on investment opportunities in Indias rapidly growing auto ancillary sector. The Fund is being promoted by IL&FS (Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services) Venture Corporation (IVC), a fund management company currently managed by IL&FS, an Indian non-bank financial institution engaged in commercial development of infrastructural services and provision of financial services, including investment banking, asset management, venture capital management, financial advisory and project development, and infrastructure project promotion and finance.The liberalization of restrictions on capacity, licensing requirements and foreign ownership has spurred growth in Indias automotive industry, and with it the ancillary sector with sales of US$2.6 billion in 1995/96 and with growth averaging over 26% p.a. in the last three years.  There has been a spate of joint ventures in the last three years between Indian companies and the automobile majors intent on establishing a presence in the Indian vehicle market.  Indications are that the new and existing auto players in India plan to operate from a platform of global competitiveness and will require from the ancillary companies they source from components that are internationally competitive in quality, price and delivery. The proposed Fund seeks to exploit investment opportunities in the new environment through direct equity and quasi-equity investments in ancillary companies undertaking expansions, upgradation as well as in greenfield projects.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a Financial Intermediary (FI) category project.

(NMCC), has a 65% ownership share in the Project.  NMCC is a consortium of the fourth and third largest Japanese cement producers, Nihon Cement Company Ltd. (70%) and Mitsubishi Materials Corporation (30%).  The local sponsor, Vietnam National Cement Corporation (VNCC), has a 35% ownership share in the Project.  VNCC is the state-owned company with responsibility for the production and distribution of cement in Vietnam.  Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Project Cost is estimated at US$ 373 million.  The proposed IFC investment consists of an A Loan of US$ 30 million, and a B Loan of US$ 26.5 million.Location of project and Description of site	The Project involves the use of 103 ha in Thanh Hoa Province, 155 ha in Nghe An Province (for quarry operations) and 9 ha in Nha Be District, Ho Chi Minh City (for a distribution terminal).  The plant site will be located in Thanh Hoa Province, approximately 210 km south of Hanoi.  The distribution terminal near Ho Chi Minh City is located about 25 km south of the center of the city.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The Project is a joint venture to construct and operate a new 2.14 million tons p.a. cement plant at Nghi Son in northern Vietnam.  The Project expects to sell most of its cement in the domestic market and export the balance to other Asian countries.  At present, demand for cement in Vietnam exceeds domestic supply by over 1.5 million tons p.a., and this gap will continue to grow unless additional capacity is added. The Project is one of several new plants and expansions which will help to bring domestic cement supply and demand into balance, hence reducing the countrys dependence on imports.  Moreover, Vietnams natural endowments of limestone, coal and other raw materials provide the basis for developing an internationally competitive cement industry.  Having secured a site for the cement plant which is on the coast and near abundant limestone reserves, the Project will take advantage of these natural endowments while also benefiting from the sponsors strengths.  The foreign sponsors will contribute the technical knowledge and experience to build and operate a state-of-the-art plant with efficient production techniques, and the local sponsor will offer knowledge of the Vietnamese cement market.  This combination of attributes should enable NSCC to compete effectively in Vietnams growing cement industry and provide about 13% of the countrys cement production capacity in the year 2000.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category A project under IFCs environmental review procedures.  Environmental issues associated with the Project include air emissions, liquid effluents, solid wastes, land use and resettlement, protection of marine resources and quarry reclamation.  Occupational health and safety issues include employee exposure to noise and dust.  Electrostatic precipitators will be installed to control dust emissions from the kiln line to less than 30 mg/Nm3, which is well within both the Government of Vietnam standard and World Bank guideline.  NSCC will cover or install dust collectors on coal, raw materials and cement products storage areas, and on the long-distance belt conveyor that will transport limestone, clay and pozzolana from the limestone quarry to the plant.  The plant will not discharge a significant amount of industrial water because the cooling water will be recycled.  Domestic sewage will be collected and treated by a system consisting of a stabilization pond and septic tanks.

Because fresh water is a scarce commodity in Senegal and especially in the Dakar area, the project will meet World Bank ambient air quality guidelines without using water injection to reduce NOx emissions.  Flue gas is emitted from a 30 m main stack.  The sponsor will conduct a thorough ambient air quality monitoring program to confirm compliance.  A one-pass sea water cooling system will be used to further reduce fresh water consumption.  Neutralization and oil-water separator will be used to treat wastewater.  The plant fire protection system will include automatic CO2 fire suppression systems for the combustion turbine generator and the control room and a water spray system for the steam turbine generator skid.

The turkey processing plant will be located next to the Companys existing beef processing facility but will be physically separate to avoid cross-contamination.  The hatchery will be located at a distance of 9 kms from the processing plant while the parent stock farms will be situated in a remote location (for good bio-security and reduced risk of disease) at a distance of 54 kms from the plant.   	Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Pinar Et is one of Turkeys leading meat processors and owns and operates a feed mill, slaughter-house (for cattle and sheep) and a meat processing unit.  Pinar Et is a pioneer in the meat industry in Turkey and is a market leader in the Aegean region with a wide range of beef-based, premium, value-added fresh, chilled, processed and frozen products.  The proposed investment will allow the Company to diversify into poultry and expand its value-added processed product range in order to take advantage of the growing demand for white meat in the domestic market. A sub-component of the project is the construction of an organic fertilizer plant to process animal waste generated from the cattle paddocks and poultry livestock outgrowers.  The project will introduce greater variety and higher quality of meat products to the Turkish consumers.  Pinar Et proposes to use contract farmers in its turkey rearing operations which will provide an additional source of income to rural farmers.  The construction of the organic fertilizer plant will help conserve the environment as it will process cattle manure and poultry litter and convert them into natural organic fertilizer pellets.  Through this project IFC will assist in introducing a new product in the meat industry to compete with red meat.  IFC would be providing long-term financing at reasonable rates that is currently not available to the Company given the high costs of local financing.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a Category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  Environmental, occupational health and safety issues associated with this project include : site selection and location; air and water emissions; solid waste handling and disposal; fire protection and emergency response; and general worker health and safety.

(Quimmco), a comparatively small and young industrial group based in Monterrey, Mexico.  Quimmco has interests in the automotive, chemical and construction industries.  Automotive industry operations account for over 90% of the groups sales, and Quimmco presently operates two foundries in partnership with Teksid (Fiat).Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Approximately US$50 million, including US$12 million IFC A Loan, a US$12 million IFC B Loan, and US$3 million of IFC equity.Location of project and Description of site	The proposed forge will be located in Ciudad Escobedo, near Monterrey in northern Mexico.  The site is located adjacent to another of Quimmcos automotive operations in an industrial area of the town.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Forja will focus on the production of large forged automotive components, specifically the production of I-beam front axles for heavy trucks and crankshafts for large diesel engines, but adaptable also to other heavy forgings.  The plant will have a design capacity of 24,300 metric tons of forged products per year.  The plant will be highly automated, allowing for greater process efficiency and quality at a lower cost than existing producers.                                           North American forge capacity has declined continuosly over the past two decades, as obsolete, small scale in-house presses have proven unable to compete against lower-cost specialized forging shops located predominantly overseas.  In particular, the NAFTA market today outsources the majority of of its class 5-8 truck front axle I-beams and crankshafts from suppliers in India, Hungary, Brazil, and Japan.  The sponsors believe that a Mexican supply source for high quality forgings would be a new strategic platform to service the North American truck and heavy machinery industry, able to compete on cost, quality and delivery time.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B Project according to IFCs environmental review procedure procedure.  Environmental issues associated wih this project include:  air emissions; liquid effluents; and occupational health and safety.  Air emissions will be limited by use of electrical induction heating and natural gas.  Liquid effluents will be recycled for irrigation.

AfricaSectorProject No007837Projected Board DateOctober 3, 1997Company NameIspat Karmet (the Company)Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders	The company is 100% part of the LNM Group (the Group), a London based group which is the worlds largest integrated mini-mill producer of steel, with steel shipments (excluding the company) exceeding 6 million tons a year.  The Groups net sales (excluding the Company) for 1996 was about $2 billion.  The Group has significant experience in managing steel plants as well as experience in managing coal mines and power plants. Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	$831 million with a proposed IFC investment of $132.5 million, including an A Loan of $65 million and a B Loan of $67.5 million.  IFC is also considering a possible equity investment of $5 million.Location of project and Description of site	The steel and power plants are located in Termirtau, Central Kazakhstan, 1,200 km North of the capital, Almaty.  The coal mines are located about 38 km East of Termirtau.Description of Company and Purpose of Project(include IFCs Role and Development Impact)	The company, formerly one of the largest producers of flat steel in the CIS with a capacity of 6 million tons of liquid steel, also owns 15 coal mines with a current capacity of about 15 million tons of coal a year, and two captive power generation plants with a combined rated capacity of 575 MW.  The steel plant along with the smaller 140 MW power plant was privatized in November 1995 through a competitive tender.  The larger 435 MW power plant was privatized in May 1996 through a Dutch Auction and the coal mines were privatized in July 1996.  The Group bought the assets in all three cases to form the company.  	The purpose of the project is to enable the company to compete effectively in the international steel market by: - restoring capacity in the steel, power and coal operations;- expanding the product mix to higher value added products; and - improving the environmental situation of the company to comply with relevant World Bank Environmental and Worker Health and Safety Guidelines.  The Group believes that IFC has a key role to play as IFCs presence provides the Group and other financiers with much needed political comfort.  In addition, IFCs due diligence has provided comfort to other financiers and has enabled the company to approach the bond market for a $150 million bond.  The Project will have a major developmental impact, both for Kazakhstan as a whole and for the regional development of the Karaganda area.  For Kazakhstan as a whole, the project will support the largest privatization to date, lead to significant technology transfer, encourage the presence and familiarization of foreign lenders in Kazakhstan and help bring in further foreign investment.  In addition, the project will lead to Kazakhstans largest export earnings besides earning from natural resources like oil, gas and gold.  For the Karaganda region, the developmental impact will be crucial.  The entire towns of Karaganda and Temirtau as well as the surrounding area (about 1 million people) indirectly depend on the Company, which used to previously account for nearly 10% of Kazakhstans GDP.  Employment not just in the plant, but in the area was thus heavily affected in 1995, when the plant was nearly closed and the workers were not paid.  The success of the project is thus essential to the economic well being of the region.  Environmental Category and Issues	This is an environmental review Category A project.   EBRD (the lead financing agency with a loan of $217.5 million)and IFC retained Dames & Moore as an independent environmental consultant to carry out and environmental audit (EA) and an environmental impact assessment (EIA) of all the operations of the company.  The main areas of environmental concerns are: - dust emissions; - emissions of SO2, NOX, and volatile organic compounds; - noise and vibration;- effluent waste water; - slag and other waste disposal issues; - the presence of methane gas in the coal mines; and- occupational health and safety concerns.  In this context, Dames & Moore, EBRD, the Company and IFC have developed three Environmental Action Plans (EAPs) for the steel works, the power plant TEC-2 and the coal mines.  The management has confirmed that it is committed to the implementation of the EAPs, through which the facilities will gradually reach full compliance with Kazakh environmental standards and with World Bank Environmental and Worker Health and Safety Guidelines.  Most of the actions required will be implemented within a three year period.  Some actions will require an additional implementation period, however, not exceeding five years except for the implementation of electrostatic precipitators in the TEC-1 power plant which will, due to technical constraints, have to be implemented gradually over eight years.  A Public Information Plan (PIP) has been carried out as part of the environmental due-diligence process.  The main objective of the PIP was to provide potentially affected residents of Temirtau, Karaganda and other communities with objective information concerning environmental impacts associated with the proposed investment program, and to incorporate, where possible, the concerns of the public into the final project plans.  The PIP, which included provision of information through local mass media including a dedicated television program as well as several public meetings, was fully implemented.  As per World Bank Environmental and Worker Health and Safety Guidelines, the Executive Summary of the Environmental, Health and Safety Audit and Assessment has been submitted to the Board of Directors.  The full environmental documentation (the EIA and the Executive Summary in Russian) has also been released for public review locally and regionally in Temirtau and Karaganda.The  is  from the Public Information Center.Host country location of environmental documentsThe Companys office in Termirtau and in Karaganda.Date SPI sent to PIC September 3, 1997This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

IFCs proposed investment consists of an A loan of up to US$22 million and a B loan of up to US$23 million.Location of project and Description of site	The project is located at Paramonga, on a coastal plain 195 km north of Lima.  The mill and 5,200 ha of cane fields are situated in a valley between the Fortaleza and Pativilca rivers.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project(include IFCs Role and Development Impact)	The project will produce 120,000 tons of refined cane sugar for domestic and industrial use.  It will be the first sugar estate in the country to be rehabilitated.  IFCs involvement supports the government program to captitalize the sugar sector, and has a strong demonstrative effect as the Paramonga model will undoubtedly be followed in the capitalization of other sugar companies.  IFC plays a catalytic role by mobilizing US$23 million in B loan participation.  Through the companys extension program, crop financing, know-how and new cane varieties will be made available to outgrowers. IFC was instrumental in bringing new technology to Peru (diffuser technology, co-generation), and in arranging for technical flows between the company and the sugar industry in South Africa.

Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedures.  The company has developed plans to address all environmental and social issues.  Mill process water is recycled for irrigation, filter cake is used as a fertilizer and bagasse is burnt to provide energy.  The boiler will be equippped with wet scrubbers to meet World Bank air emissions standards.  Due to overstaffing, the company plans to terminate 309 workers.  A comprehensive package of health and safety measures will be incorporated in the project, including training in the handling and use of fungicides/pesitcides.  Current overstaffing at the mill will be addressed through a phased program of retirement and lay-offs negotiated with staff and unions, and the company has prepared detailed plans to provide displaced workers with severance or retirement pay packages, training to acquire new job skills, and assistance in starting their own businesses.

IDFC will focus on innovative ways to create instruments to unbundle and mitigate risks for investors in infrastructure projects, to promote the development of local long-term bond markets and to develop expertise in structured financing for infrastructure.  Although IDFC has been promoted by the Government of India, it will have majority private sector ownership, with an independent Board and a strong commercial orientation.  Apart from IFC, the significant private sector and institutional shareholders in IDFC include life insurance companies, commercial banks and bilateral and multilateral institutions such as Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GSIC), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC).Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The proposed share capital of IDFC is Rs. 10 billion (US$285 million equivalent).  The IFC investment will be for up to US$20 million in equity for up to 7% of the equity in IDFC.Location of project and Description of site	IDFC was incorporated in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, on January 30, 1997.  Its headquarter is in Chennai, but it also has a significant presence in Mumbai, the major financial center in India.	Description of Company and Purpose of Project	India needs to develop its infrastructure to sustain its economic growth and the demand for infrastructure investment is expected to grow susbstantially as the level of industrialization and modernization accelerates and the degree of urbanization increases.  Existing financial institutions and banks are constrained by the time profile of their own liabilities and cannot prudently provide large volumes of long-term debt.  Given the complexity of risks inherent in infrastructure projects, lenders and investors often perceive the project cash flows and the collateral as insufficient inducement to invest the amounts needed.  IDFCs credit enhancement and secondary market liquidity mechanisms, are expected to address these issues and thereby assist in deepening and broadening the domestic capital market.  Through financial innovations and its high credit rating, IDFC would also be able to competitively mobilize long-term funds from the international capital markets.  	IDFC will help create a long-term debt market for infrastructure projects in a way that will allow it to leverage its capital many more times than if it had acted as a direct lender.  IDFC will complement the role of the existing financial institutions and banks in the financing of infrastructure projects in India by providing credit enhancement, offering stand-by liquidity facilities to lengthen maturities for loans to infrastructure projects, securitizing pools of infrastructure loans and offering other financing mechanisms to mobilize domestic and international investor funds.Environmental Category and Issues	This is an Environmental Review category FI project.

Cosco Ltd, which is the sponsor for the project, will have an 85% equity stake in the project.  The Sharma Group has a long history in the paper manufacturing business, and owns paper mills and converting plants in Botswana, South Africa, Swaziland, United Arab Emirates and Zambia.  The Group has a talented pool of managers and technical personnel well versed in paper manufacturing and marketing.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Project Cost is estimated at US$47.3 million; the proposed IFC investment consists of a Senior (A and B) loans of US$27.0 million, a Shareholder loan of US$3 miilion and a nominal equity investment of US$45,000.Location of project and Description of site	The project will be located in Germiston area in the Gauteng province of South Africa.	Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The project is to install and operate an integrated paper mill, consisting of deinked pulp (DIP) mill, tissue paper mill and converting lines.  The DIP mill will havethe capacity to produce 120 tons per day (40,000 tpa) of deinked pulp from waste paper.  Fifty percent of the output will be fed into the downstream tissue facility to produce 60 tons per day (20,000 tpa) of tissue paper and converted tissue products. The remaining deinked pulp (20,000 tpa), in the form of wetlap, will be sold to Swazi Paper Mills, an existing client of IFC, and a part of the Sharma Group.  	IFC Role & Developmental Impact:  The project offers an opportunity for IFC to assist in the advancement of a regional group, and in the fostering of economic integration in the SADC area.  Besides itself providing financing, IFC will play an important catalytic role by arranging a B-Loan.  The project will have a strong developmental impact.  It will contribute positively to the environment through its use of recycled waste paper.  The labor-intensive means employed in collecting waste paper, is particularly important given South Africas unemployment rate of 30%, which is actually much higher in the black community.  Employment creation is a major priority of the government policy.  The project will create employment both directly and indirectly for some 340 people.  Training programs will be instituted to reskill and train local staff; this will include appropriate overseas training.  Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  The key environmental and health and safety issues include air emissions, effluent treatment and discharge, solid waste and sludge management and disposal, hazardous materials storage and handling, and workplace health and safety.  The only significant air emissions generated are particulates, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides from the coal-fired steam boiler, which will be appropriately controlled to meet World Bank standards for these units.  Process effluents will be pretreated and discharged  to the municipal sewerage system.  Solid wastes and effluent pretreatment plant sludges will be disposed by a third party contractor in an approved off-site landfill.  Hazardous chemicals will be segregated and stored in areas with adequate spill containment.  Adequate fire protection features and procedures will be provided, and the installation will comply with World Bank health and safety requirements.

Aliaga is a small town which benefits from very good transportation and communication facilities.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project		Viking, one of Turkeys leading industrial and tissue paper manufacturers, proposes a US$25 million expansion and modernization project.  The Companys total industrial paper production capacity is about 23,000 tons per year.  Viking also has a tissue paper conversion line of 12,000 tons per year.   The project would almost double the Companys total paper manufacturing capacity by adding a second paper machine of 25,000 tons (all for tissue paper) for a total paper production (industrial and tissue) of about 48,000 tons per year.  The existing machine would produce exclusively industrial paper.  The Companys main strategic objectives are to take advantage of a rapidly growing market in tissue paper and to maintain its position as one of the dominant manufacturers in the domestic industrial paper sector.  The goals of Vikings investment program are to: (i) increase its share of tissue paper in Turkey and develop exports of tissue paper to neighboring countries, (ii) maintain its share in industrial paper, (iii) strengthen its cost competitiveness through increased economies of scale, (iv) develop higher value added products, (v) upgrade and expand its environmental treatment facility, and (vi) broaden the Companys sources of long-term capital financing.  The project would be located at the Companys existing facility at Aliaga, 60 km north of Izmir, Turkeys largest seaport.  Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  Environmental issues include air emissions, liquid effluents, and solid waste disposal.  Occupational and safety issues include exposure to high temperatures and potentially hazardous aerosols. Viking Paper operates a wastewater treatment plant having both biological and chemical treatments.  The plant has a treatment capacity of 4000 m3 of waste water.  The treated water is discharged to the Guzelhisar River.  The effluent waste water meets World Bank water quality guidelines.  Based on its review of available information regarding potential environmental impacts and proposed mitigation measures, IFC concludes that Viking Paper proposed project will meet World Bank environmental, health and safety policies and guidelines and host country requirements.

Secondly, IFCs involvement provides a comfort to CIB, L&G and Government of Egypt (GOE).  Thirdly, IFCs continued advice and dialogue with the regulators on matters relating to financial sector development are viewed as being important by all parties to suggest further changes in the insurance sector, which would benefit positively both the industry and the countrys capital markets.	The development impact of this project will be substantial, as:  (a) it will establish Egypts first joint-venture life insurance company (existing players are either effectively subsidiaries of international companies or local firms without international expertise), providing a strong demonstration effect for others; (b) it will develop further local investment and resources, stemming the outflow of potential investment resources from the country; and (c) as a key component of development of the capital markets, the development of a life insurance market in Egypt is expected to have significant downstream impact on the development and emergence of related financial services, particularly the pensions and investment management businesses.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category C project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  No further environmental review is required.Date SPI sent to PIC November 11, 1997This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

The project site is a land area of 4.2 hectares situated near a good and plentiful water supply and a reliable power source, with easy access to the greater Baku market.  The available area provides adequate space for production and warehouse facilities (8,200 m2), administrative offices (1,500 m2), water storage and parking, plus room for future growth for the addition of the second line. Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Baku Coca-Cola Bottlers Ltd. (BCCB) was established in Azerbaijan in July 1994 to import and distribute Coca-Cola products in the greater Baku market.  In March 1996, the Company undertook construction of a greenfield Coca-Cola bottling facility in Baku.  The plant was completed in August, 1996 and commercial production began in September.  The state-of-the-art bottling plant has a nominal annual capacity of 60 million liters, using modern polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle production, generating employment for 270 people.  IFC provided a long-term loan of US$3.5 million for the greenfield project, and has approved an equity investment of US$2.3 million equivalent in the Company.  Long-term financing for projects outside the oil sector from local and foreign private sources is generally unavailable in Azerbaijan.                                                                               Growth in soft drink consumption and BCCBs performance have exceeded both the Companys and IFCs expectations:  actual 1997 YTD sales volumes are more than double projections.  The Company has established a successful direct distribution program in greater Baku and has launched a regional dealer network.  In order to avoid capacity restrictions in the near future, and to better supply growing demand from its regional dealer network, the Company has proposed an expansion project for: (i) upgrading bottling capacity by addition of a second PET bottling line; (ii) expanding warehouse capacity at its Baku facility, and; (iii) improvements in regional distribution infrastructure.    Environmental Category and Issues	This is an environmental review category B project.  Environmental, occupational health and safety issues issues associated with this project include water supply, liquid effluents, air emissions, solid waste disposal, potential contamination of the site from present or past uses, use of CFCs in refrigeration systems, and workplace noise and safety.  The sponsor has implemented plans to address these issues and has demonstrated that the expansion project will comply with all relevant Government of Azerbaijan, City of Baku, and World Bank environmental policies and guidelines.

As a result, the project will not only have a strong development impact on the wood processing sector, but will also have a positive impact on the financial sector.	IFCs agents will be four local commercial banks.  It is expected that the agent banks will share a small portion of the risk in each sub-project through co-financing.  It is also expected that there may be limited co-financing from external sources.

The Project will expand and modernize the Companys new facilities to increase car battery production and recycling capacity. The Project will also provide working capital to finance its increased sales and will restructure part of its short-term debt. By supporting the Project, IFC will provide necessary long-term funds and will provide assurance to other investors about opportunities in the country. IFCs support to Baterias modernization efforts would also give a strong signal to other local companies that are considering to modernize in order to remain competitive. The Project is also consistent with IFCs strategy to support projects that have positive environmental impacts. The Project has environmental benefits since it decreases contamination by recycling a large portion of disposed car batteries in the area. In addition, there will be a strong demonstrative effect which can stimulate higher environmental standards for other companies in the region, as a main player in the market raises its level of modernization and operates its business with high environmental standards. The Project supports direct employment at the Company, and supports indirect employment of people in distribution, retail, and collection and sales of disposed car batteries.

NGCs principal asset is its wholly-owned subsidiary Commonwealth & British Minerals PLC (CBM) which has a 44% interest in ZGC, a joint venture among CBM, IFC, and the Government of Tajikistan represented by the State Committee for Precious Metals.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The project cost is estimated at US$28.6 million comprising US$19.6 million capital expenditure of ZGC and up to US$9.0 million equity investment in NGC.  IFC will provide a US$3.0 million loan to ZGC and up to US$3 million equity subscription for about 10% interest in NGC.Location of project and Description of site	The mine is located in the Khujand region of northwestern Tajikistan. Description of Company and Purpose of Project	This project will allow for completion of an expansion program of ZGC in Tajikistan and it will expand the capital base of the parent company, NGC.  The expansion program involves an increase in production from the Jilau open pit mine and an increase in capacity of the carbon-in-leach processing plant from 0.7 million to 1.7 million tonnes of ore per year to produce about 100,000 ounces (3.1 tonnes) of gold per year.  Stronger capital base of NGC will help fund NGCs on-going exploration program in  Central Asia and possible expansion in West Africa.The investment in ZGC will have a positive development impact on the economy of Tajikistan.  The expansion of the mine will double project export earnings and the Governments share of cash flow from the project, in the form of royalties, taxes and dividends.  The development and continued success of an internationally competitive mining operation has also a strong demonstration value.NGC is in negotiations for the acquisition of a gold mine in West Africa. If successful, the investment in NGC will therefore contribute to the rehabilitation of a gold mine in West Africa and create jobs and export earnings.  The continuation of an exploration program in Tajikistan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Kazakhstan (Central Asia) may lead to the development of new mining projects and therefore may have a large leverage effect. Environmental Category and Issues	The expansion of the existing operation is a category B project according to the IFCs environmental review.  The key issues that will be addressed as part of the environmental review include NGC''s corporate environment and social policy; land use modifications; tailings treatment and disposal; liquid effluent and solid waste disposal; water resources; and general worker safety.The environmental effects of this expansion will be limited. Studies undertaken for the previous investment demonstrated that no parks or ecologically protected or sensitive areas or historic sites are located within the areas that could be affected by the proposed expansion.  The construction of the new tailings facility will result in the loss of approximately 70ha of seasonal grazing land. ZGC has developed a mutually acceptable compensation package with the collective farm and has also provided additional irrigation facilities.  As part of the initial expansion phase of the project, ZGC decided to opt for the ozonation process to destroy cyanide.  Unfortunately this process has not worked as well as expected.  As part of the expansion program, the ozonation plant will be brought back into operation.  The existing operation is in compliance with World Bank guidelines.IFC will monitor the sponsors ongoing compliance with World Bank policies, and environmental, health and safety guidelines during the life of the project by evaluating monitoring reports submitted annually to IFC and by conducting periodic site reviews during project supervision.The  is  from the Public Information Center.Date SPI sent to PIC December 2, 1997This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

The shareholding structure of Modern Karton as of December 31, 1996 was as follows: the Eren Group (75%); Dentas, another Turkish paper producer, (20%) and others (5%).Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment	The project cost is estimated at US$89.3 million.  The proposed IFC investment is a loan of US$30 million, of which US$10 million will be for the account of participants. Location of Project and Description of Site	Modern Kartons two existing paperboard lines are located in Corlu, an industrial area, about 100 km west of Istanbul.  The new production line will also be installed at the same site.  The plant is well connected to the road network in Turkey.Description of Company and Purpose of Project(include IFCs Role and Development Impact)	Modern Karton is the largest private sector producer of corrugating packaging materials in Turkey.  The Companys expansion and modernization program has many components, the most important of which is the expansion of the Companys capacity from 90,000 tpy to 290,000 tpy by installing a new, complete production line for white-top liner, test liner and fluting.  This is in line with Modern Kartons strategy of removing capacity constraints on existing equipment and improving quality to meet competition particularly from imports from the EU. The additional production will primarily be sold on the domestic market.  IFCs role in the project will include providing long-term financing to the Company, assisting a second-tier Turkish company access international financial markets through the syndication and providing technical assistance through its review and suggestions in evaluating the project design and the cost structure of the project.  The project is also expected to have a positive development impact: it will create  40 new direct jobs in Turkey and 400 more indirect jobs; it will impact the environment positively since waste paper collection and recycling will be stimulated due to the substantially larger waste paper needs of the Company; it will raise skill levels in Turkey since no other production facility in Turkey uses the modern technology that the Company intends to use; it will benefit customers from improved product quality and new and more sophisticated products; and it will assist a good company in its transition to becoming an internationally competitive company.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure. The expansion and modernization project will take place on the existing facility and no additional land will be acquired.  The project does not therefore involve any relocation or resettlement.  The Sponsor will buy all electricity and steam needed for the project from Modern Enerji which means that MK will not have air emissions.  The industrial liquid effluents from the plant will be treated in a biological wastewater treatment plant.  MK will therefore comply with local governmental standards and World Bank guidelines for liquid effluents.  Modern Karton will establish Safety and Occupational Health programs to comply with governmental standards and World Bank guidelines.

Empresas ICA is a Mexican holding company that includes the largest construction company in Mexico and is involved in industry, urban works, manufacturing, capital goods, tourism and extraction and marketing of construction materials.Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment	Estimated project cost is US$19.6 million.  The proposed IFC investment would include an A Loan of up to US$4 million, a B Loan of up to US$7 million and an equity investment of up to US$1 million.Location of Project and Description of Site	The proposed terminal will be constructed adjacent to San Miguel, the only city on Cozumel, where the commercial infrastructure of the island is located, and will consist of a pier and a land terminal.  The pier will be L-shaped and will have two docking positions which can receive both third generation cruise ships (42,000 tons, 180 meters, carrying up to 750 passengers) and fourth generation cruise ships (75,000 tons, 300 meters, carrying up to 2,200 passengers).Description of Company and Purpose of Project(include IFCs Role and Development Impact)	The Project will comprise the construction and operation of a cruise ship terminal under a 25-year concession from the Administración Portuaria Integral de Quintana Roo, S.A. de C.V.  Operation is expected to begin in January 1999. As a consequence of the steady growth in cruise ship arrivals, Cozumel now lacks sufficient docking capacity for arriving cruise ships.  The proposed Project, along with one existing terminal and another currently under construction, will remove the docking bottleneck.  Cruise ship tourism can bring high revenues to ports and make a significant contribution to state, national and regional economies.  Tourism is Cozumels principal industry.                                                                                   IFCs investment would reinforce the efforts of the Government of Mexico to decentralize its port administration and open the port sector to private entrepreneurs and will secure limited-recourse private finance for the provision of cost-effective infrastructure services.

The remaining 20% is owned by Société Nationale des Hydrocarbures (SNH), Cameroons state oil company.Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment	To assist Pecten in meeting its ongoing financing needs, IFC is to provide a long-term revolving credit facility consisting of an A Loan of up to US$75 million for IFCs account and a B Loan of up to US$190 million, for the account of participants, but with an aggregate amount not exceeding US$250 million.Location of Project and Description of Site	The Project is located in the Rio del Rey basin, offshore Cameroon.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Pecten and Elf Serepca (which is owned 20% by SNH and 80% by Elf Aquitaine) have participating interests in nine operating concessions in the Lokélé and Rio del Rey permit areas, which account for over 95% of Cameroon''s oil production.  The purpose of the investment is to provide flexible financing to facilitate the ongoing development of the permit areas.  This development work is aimed at reducing the otherwise-expected decline in oil production, by improving recovery from mature fields and initiating production from more marginal fields that have become economically attractive as a result of special incentives offered by the Government of Cameroon.In the past, finance for Pectens development expenditures in the Rio del Rey basin has been provided as distinct project financing, on an approximately biannual basis.  Pecten has found this to be inefficient, expensive and ill-matched to its actual financial requirements.  Pecten has thus asked IFC to provide a revolving credit facility, which more closely matches its needs and which will remove the requirement for the repeated raising of new finance.  The proposed investment is designed to provide innovative financing in Cameroon, that will meet Pecten''s needs in a flexible manner for at least the next five years.Prior to 1991, Pecten was able to arrange financing on the international markets, without IFCs assistance.  Since then, however, the international banking community has made it clear that it would no longer provide the long-term financing which is required for the continued development of Cameroons oil resources without IFCs participation to mitigate perceived political risks.  This continues to be the case.  At the same time, the proposed financing is vital to ensure the optimal exploitation of Cameroons most important oilfields. IFC intends to mobilize up to about 75% of the proposed debt financing from external sources.  With IFC as the catalyst, this Project will be able to mobilize significant funds for an innovative financing facility in a country with a high level of perceived political risk.Cameroon is sub-Saharan Africas fifth largest oil producer and oil accounts for a large proportion of Government revenue.  The direct benefits of this Project to Cameroon are thus considerable as it receives a large proportion of the operating income arising from oil production, as well as dividends.  The Project will therefore generate a significant amount of additional foreign exchange earnings for the country.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  The following potential environmental, health and safety impacts were key issues addressed during IFCs environmental review:  existing environmental conditions/practices, operational discharges into the sea, the management of produced gas, oil spills, and occupational health and safety.  Pecten has been involved in the exploration  for and production of hydrocarbons in the Project area since 1974 and experience to date confirms that operations have not impacted the Gulf of Guinea.  The Company has prepared an environmental management plan (EMP) which outlines the environmental practices of Pecten and Elf Serepca and addresses, inter alia, the quality of overboard water, drill muds, and oil spills.  IFC''s Environment Division has concluded that the Project complies fully with World Bank environmental policies and guidelines.

The Project has been conceived of for the purpose of producing sets of molded plastic components for  clothes washing machines.  Injection molding lends itself to relatively quick change-over to manufacture of a wide range of parts which could have any number of customers or applications.	Scame is well regarded as a cost effective producer of quality molded plastic parts for major appliance manufacturers.  In order to support the transfer of its know-how to Poprad, Scame has had key technical staff in training at its Italian facilities for nearly one-half year and Scame will send technical management to live on-site in Poprad for a minimum of one-half year following the start-up of operations.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure. The plant will be located in an enlarged building within a manufacturing complex; existing manufacturing operations are not expected to have resulted in land contamination.  Infrastructure services (water, sewer, gas, electricity) will be provided by the complex.  Environmental, occupational health and safety issues associated with this project include:  solid and hazardous waste disposal, fire protection and emergency response, and employee training and workplace safety. Plastic scrap will be recycled in the process and about 130 tons per year of paper wastes will be sold for recycling.  Solvents used will be disposed of in accordance with local regulations.

The two later Sponsors are both members of the Koc Group of companies, the oldest and largest privately owned conglomerate in Turkey.	The Sponsors together bring a unique combination of useful expertise to the implementation of the Project, including experience with construction and property leasing in Moscow, western retailing knowledge and practice with imports of product into Russia.Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment	US$140 million, including an IFC A loan of US$35 million and a B loan of up to US$50 million to be syndicated to commercial banks on a best efforts basis.Location of Project and Description of Site	The stores will be located in middle and upper income areas in Moscows mid to outer suburbs. These areas typify the suburban dormitory high rise developments common during the communist period, presenting high density populations within a natural catchment area for a retail store. The four new hypermarkets are being constructed on previously undeveloped land. The hypermarkets are situated on major roads and at major intersections and are serviced by public transportation. Each has adequate space for a substantial parking lot.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The construction and operation of four greenfield hypermarkets with integrated mini-malls in suburban Moscow under the name Ramstore. IFCs role in the Project will be to assist the Sponsors in establishing a viable private sector business which will take advantage of an extremely underdeveloped retail market in Moscow by opening western style supermarkets in suburban areas where there are a limited number of retail outlets and a concentration of housing developments. The Corporation is also needed to mobilize the required limited recourse finance and provide the Sponsors with added comfort in relation to political risk. From a developmental standpoint, the Project will make available lower cost, high quality food and non-food items to the domestic market on a consistent basis. It will also introduce state-of-the-art inventory management, marketing and sales techniques which will serve to improve the overall retail sector in Moscow as it will be a model for former state-owned enterprises and others to follow.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure. Environmental, occupational health and safety issues associated with the Project include site selection and site history, liquid and solid waste disposal, use of CFCs, fire protection and emergency response, and general worker health and safety.  The shopping malls will be erected only after all construction permits are obtained. To obtain these permits a comprehensive study on preservation of natural environment has to be carried out for each store.

The remaining 20% are mainly in the hands of the public (original supporters of the founder), and retired and existing employees. The Company plans to become public by listing new shares in Guatemalas, Mexicos or New Yorks stock exchanges.Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment	The total project cost is estimated at about US$124 million.  IFCs proposed investment is expected to be in the form of up to US$20 million in an A Loan and a Convertible Subordinated C loan of up to US$5 million.Location of Project and Description of Site	The project will be located throughout Guatemala and El Salvador, covering the main cities, the interior and the more rural areas of the two countries.Description of Company and Purpose of Project(include IFCs Role and Development Impact)	La Fragua is Guatemalas largest retail supermarket chain, with 49 stores located in Guatemala City, and 19 in the interior of the country. La Fraguas three-year Project will involve the following components: (a)opening about 48 new stores in Guatemala and 32 in El Salvador; (b) modernizing and refurbishing existing facilities and operations; (c) opening a state-of-the-art distribution center; and (d) modernizing and improving information and technology systems.  The Company expects to benefit from higher margins (as a result of lower fixed costs, improved efficiencies and economies of scale), to streamline and run more technologically-efficient operations, and improve its competitive position, while at the same time preempting local and foreign competitors wishing to enter the market.  IFCs financing provides La Fragua with long-term funding which would otherwise be limited and expensive through other sources for companies in Guatemala.  In addition, as La Fraguas first foreign lender, IFC could serve as a catalyst to encourage greater foreign investment in the Company.  IFCs participation would also improve the Companys corporate governance through improved reporting and better management practices, while acting as an agent of change in its expansion plans.  La Fraguas Project is expected to have the following developmental impacts: (i) the Companys expansion plans would assist in distributing to the less able population groups a wider variety of food and other basic necessity items (at lower or competitive prices) under cleaner and more hygienic conditions.  By delivering products in the interior at the same price as in the capital cities, the Project would foster a more competitive environment, while reducing traveling time and distances for the more remote communities. The Project would also improve the distribution of food and non-food items in Guatemala and El Salvador, by introducing best practice and modern retailing methods, and by bringing about technological improvements in logistics and distribution systems; and (ii) the Project will create about 1,800 jobs, primarily for women, contributing to social and economic growth in the more rural areas of the two countries. In addition, the Project would also provide uncommon employee-benefit packages and higher than average compensation rates.  The expansion plans would also foster better academical standards and training, and create career opportunities for the Companys employees and management, thereby improving the standards of living in the region in which it will operate. Environmental Category and Issues	This is an environmental review category B project.  Issues include land use and site location, liquid effluents treatment and discharge, solid waste management, use of non-CFC refrigerants, fire protection, safety and emergency response and general worker health and safety.  The sponsor will implement actions to address these issues and demonstrate that the Project will comply with applicable Guatemalan and Salvadorian requirements and World Bank guidelines. Liquid effluents will be treated and properly disposed.  Solid residues will be either recycled or properly disposed according to local regulations.  Non-CFC refrigerants will be used.

Ltda (AUTCL)RegionLatin America & CaribbeanSectorProject No008836Projected Board DateApril 1, 1998Company NameAssociacion Union Tamberos Coop. Ltda (AUTCL)Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders	The Association Union Tamberos (AUTCL or the Cooperative) is an Argentine dairy cooperative established in 1925 by farmers of Swiss and Italian origin.  The cooperative has currently 1,237 dairy farms as members.  In 1995, the Cooperatives General Assembly approved the spin-off of its industrial assets into a common stock company, Milkaut S.A. (the Company).  Following the spin-off, Milkaut S.A. launch a US$44.5 million investment program which was financed in 1996 by IFC.  The Company now operates 7 industrial plants and processes 1,100,000 liters of milk per day supplied exclusively by the cooperative. AUTCL, with annual consolidated sales of US$150 million, currently ranks third in the Argentine dairy sector.Milkauts product line covers the whole spectrum of dairy products: butter, cheese, pasteurized and U.H.T. milk, yogurt, cream, dulce de leche (a caramelized condensed milk), custards, milk powder, milk protein and lactose. 	Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment	The total investments made by the farmers during the project is estimated at US$ 28 millions.  IFC loan will finance around  43% of total on-farm investment, while 57 % will come from the farmers own resources.  The average size  of loan per farmer will be around US$ 40 000 mainly to finance the upgrading of production facilities, pasture improvements and the purchase of milking and cooling equipment.Location of Project and Description of Site	90% of the farmers which will benefit from the dairy facility are located within a radius of 60 miles from the Cooperatives plants in Franck, in the province of Santa Fe.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	This facility totaling up to US$12 million will finance capital investment requirements of about 300 members of the Cooperative representing 25% of its existing members.  The objective of the credit program is to secure the long term supply of milk to the cooperative by (i) increasing the future competitiveness of the dairy farmers by improving production per cow and per person employed in the dairy operation; (ii) increasing the net profit per cow and per ha of forrage crop used; and (iii) improving the milk quality by safeguarding the hygienic handling of milk at the farm.	IFC is interested in extending its reach to the dairy farmers members of Milkaut. This will help the cooperative to consolidate its relationship with its suppliers and to better control raw material  prices  in the future.With the help of IFC, Milkauts farmers will be able to increase their future competitiveness, their milk sales, and their net income  By using a leading Argentine bank as agent, IFC wants to demonstrate the administration of such a loan package is profitable, and hopefully will encourage the local bank to provide similar loans in the future without IFC intervention. It will also provide direct financing to farmers in a practical, efficient and cost-effective manner while only assuming the risk of the sponsor and the bank. Also, IFC will confirm its commitment to successful primary agriculture which, in this case, has been the basis for Argentine competitiveness in dairy.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a Financial Intermediary (FI) project according to IFCs environmental review procedure. Some specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.  The review of this project consisted of the technical appraisal and site review completed by IFCs Agribusiness Department staff.  The following potential environmental, health and safety impacts of this project were analyzed:  site location, air emissions, refrigerant usage, liquid effluents, solid waste management, noise control, and general employee training, health and safety.Information provided on how these potential impacts would be addressed in the AUTCL project: 	As part of the local approval process Milkauts technical team will assure that prior to loan disbursement all environmental issues have been satisfactorily addressed.  As outlined in the attached questionnaire, no loans will be disbursed unless: the refrigeration equipment in the milk storage tanks will use an environmentally friendly coolant; the waste water from cleaning the milking equipment is disposed of in a septic tank or equivalent; the stocking density of livestock is low enough to avoid a high concentration of solid waste on the lands. 				As an ongoing process Milkauts technical team routinely visit the members farms to advice on animal husbandry practices, milk hygiene, feed supply, and breeding policy.  In the future this team will also ensure that the loan recipient will continue to conform with the environmental guidelines of the project. 	IFC will ensure ongoing compliance with World Bank environmental, health and safety policies and guidelines during the life of the project by evaluating monitoring reports submitted annually to IFC by Milkaut, and by conducting periodic supervision.

(""Corsa"") was established by Angel Cordoba Sanchez in 1956 in the northeast zone of Mexico City and is still owned by the founder and his family.  Angel Cordoba Nieto (age 56), CEO and General Director, heads up a management team of experienced professionals.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Total project cost is estimated at US$ 33 million equivalent.  IFC is considering a total investment of US$ 16 million, including a loan of US$ 13 million and equity/quasi-equity of US$ 3 million, both for its own account.Location of project and Description of site	The proposed expansion project will be carried out on land (already purchased and leveled for construction) adjacent to the existing plant in Mexico City.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Corsa is the leading manufacturer of steel sections and merchant bars for the Mexican market.  The Company also exports about 25% of its production, mainly to the U.S.  Corsa plans a two-stage expansion and modernization program:  a new rolling mill, followed by new steel melting and casting facilities.  The proposed project is the first stage of Corsa''s expansion/modernization program:  the installation of a new up-to-date continuous rolling mill.  The timing of the second stage (new steel melting and casting facilities) is contingent on the worldwide outlook for steel demand and prices.  Corsa is a medium-size, family owned Mexican company which does not have access to longer-term financing.  By providing a long-term debt financing package with adequate terms, IFC would play a role as an agent of change in enabling the Company''s future growth and facilitating its goal to become a publicly listed company.

Privredna Banka Zagreb (PBZ) owns a 30% stake in Belisce and is the largest shareholder.  PBZ is still a government-owned bank and the largest in Croatia.  About 50% of the shares are held by former and current employees and the remaining 18% are owned by the Croatian government through the national privatization and pension funds.  PBZ is in effect the Sponsor of the project as it will provide a project funds guarantee.Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment	The project cost is estimated at DM74.7 million (US$42.2 million equivalent).  IFCs investment would comprise: (i) an equity investment of up to DM11 million (US$6.2 million equivalent), (ii) a senior A loan of DM25 million (US$14.1 million equivalent) for IFCs own account and (iii) a senior B loan of DM25 million (US$14.1 million equivalent) for the account of participants.Location of Project and Description of Site	Belisce is located next to the Drava River near the Hungarian border in the northeastern part of Croatia.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Belisce d.d.s paper manufacturing facility was damaged during the war in 1991/92.  The project would rebuild and modernize the production facility and bring it into compliance with World Bank environmental guidelines.  The Company has been in the wood processing business since 1884, of which the last 36 years were in the production and sales of packaging paper and corrugated products.  Belisce has consistently performed well and is a key employer and source of revenue in its region of Croatia.  This project is essential for the survival of the Company which employs about 2,300 workers.	The Balkan war and break-up of Yugoslavia have damaged the manufacturing plant and reduced the market for the Companys products.  Furthermore, the Companys machinery and equipment are outdated since no significant new investments have been made in the past decade.  In order to take advantage of the improving economic climate Belisce will have to modernize the plant and restructure existing debt.  IFC has been asked to provide the financing because local sources of long term financing are difficult to obtain at reasonable rates.  The estimated financial and economic rates of return for the project are high because of the nature of the planned investments, where a shift of product mix and elimination of bottlenecks through high-priority replacements, upgrades and reconstruction will allow Belisce to better utilize existing capacity.  The project is also expected to generate significant foreign exchange earnings since about two-thirds of Belisces sales are from exports.  Furthermore, the project would enable Belisce to recycle waste paper and invest significantly in environmental control equipment, thereby bringing Belisce into compliance with World Bank environmental guidelines.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  Sources of air emissions include the gas-fired power plant and the black liquor evaporation boiler, and these are fitted with appropriate control technology to control emissions.  The Sponsor is carrying out further investigations on air emission quality and will address any deficiencies in air emission controls and meet the World Bank Group guidelines.  The industrial effluents from the plant, as well as sanitary wastes, are currently treated before discharge to the Drava River.  This investment will ensure that the effluents discharged will comply with local requirements and World Bank guidelines. Solid wastes are appropriately disposed or recycled as products or fuel. The Company has established occupational health and safety programs to comply with governmental standards and World Bank Group guidelines, and hazardous materials are properly handled and stored.  Belisces wood had been supplied largely from thinning of existing sustainably managed forests in Croatia.  Belisce is increasing its use of waste paper to replace some of the forest production.

Peterson and William Wrench both businessmen/real estate developers in the Washington DC metropolitan area, to rehabilitate and expand the shrimp farm facility originally developed and subsequently abandoned by Maya Mariculture Company.  NOVAs shareholders are the Peterson Family (68.25%); Robert Phillips, the Managing Director of the Company (25.00%); William Wrench (3.75%); and James Hyde, Secretary and Treasurer of NOVA joining from Maya Mariculture (3.00%). The entire existing operation, including all land and existing improvements thereon is owned by NOVA. The capital the Company needed has largely been provided by Mr. Peterson through cash contributions.Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment	Total Project Cost is estimated at US$17 million. IFC is considering up to US$6.0 million loan investment for IFCs own account (A Loan). Location of Project and Description of Site	The Project involves the expansion of an existing shrimp production operation situated on the mainland 12.5 miles north of Belize City, and construction of a hatchery to be located offshore on Ambergris Caye. The shrimp farm uses 1000 m buffer zone along the shoreline so that there is no encroachment on mangrove habitat. The area is characterized as wet savanna and is characteristic of the low-lying coastal region of the country. On Ambergris, the site is 13 miles north of the San Pedro town, adjacent to a natural cut in the barrier reef. There is a commercial grade pier adjacent to the property as well as a gravel airstrip 1.5 miles from the site.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	NOVA is the largest shrimp farming operation in Belize with 225 ha of ponds on the 700 ha site. The Project is designated to improve NOVAs response to the growing market demand for aquaculture products in United States and consists of (i) the shrimp farm expansion by establishing additional 515 ha of grow-out ponds and (ii) the construction of a hatchery with a capacity of approximately 100 million postlarvae (PL) per month. The additional farming hectares will not only allow the Company to increase its production but also to fully exploit the economies of scale at the Belize site and further improve its gross margin. the construction of the shrimp hatchery along with the existing marketing company (based in United States) would complete the vertical integration for the group thus increasing its competition capacity in the shrimp industry. The Project is expected to generate employment for about 85 people and provide export earnings of US$ 9 to 10 million per year. Successful implementation of this Project would lead to development of an alternative export industry does diversifying Belizes economic base. IFCs participation in the Project, by providing long term finance, will encourage other potential long term financiers to look into Belize industries and their related term finance needs.  Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria. The main environmental concern with this Project involved the siting in close proximity to important coastline mangrove habitat. The project is located inland of the mangrove area and there will be no encroachment on this habitat. Waste management issues are all being properly handled to avoid any impacts and ensure that all emissions are well within World bank group guidelines.

The projects ownership will be as follows: 25% by Occidental Properties, B.V., Occidentals real estate company based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands; 25% by Caja de Ahorros y Pensiones de Barcelona (La Caixa), the largest Spanish savings bank; 25% by Orisa Holding Ltd., a company established in Panama; and 25% by Taradale Developments Ltd. based in the British Virgin Islands. Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment	Total project cost is estimated at US$56.0 million, of which IFC proposes to provide a senior A Loan of US$6.3 million for its own account, a senior B Loan of US$21.7 million for the account of participants, and a quasi-equity investment of US$7.7 million in the form of a subordinated income participating loan for IFCs own account.Location of Project and Description of Site	The hotel will be constructed at Playa Bávaro, near Punta Cana, on the east coast of the Dominican Republics. T he location, which is known for its high quality beaches, offers an ideal Caribbean vacation atmosphere and adequate infrastructure, including a nearby international airport.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The project will consist of the construction of the Flamenco Bávaro resort, an 853-room  four-star hotel to be located near Punta Cana.  The hotel will be built, owned, and managed by companies affiliated with Occidental Hoteles, a leading Spanish hotel chain which is active in the Dominican Republic.  The project is being undertaken to capitalize on the strong growth in tourism in the Dominican Republic and on the popularity of the Flamenco Puerto Plata, an existing Occidental hotel in the Dominican Republic which was expanded in 1993 with IFC assistance (IFC/R93-43).  With the continued growth of tourism to the Dominican Republic and the popularity of Occidentals existing properties in the country, the project represents a natural next step as tour operators have expressed strong interest for the Group to build a property similar to the Flamenco Playa in the Punta Cana area.  Punta Cana is the fastest growing resort area within the Dominican Republic and is a destination where Occidental has previously had no presence.  	IFCs involvement is important to the projects implementation, as alternative sources of long-term project financing are virtually unavailable in the Dominican Republic.  In addition, unlike other island economies, tourism has significant linkages to the rest of the economy in the Dominican Republic (e.g., some 90% of the food and beverages served at the hotel will be produced domestically).  This project is expected to provide direct employment to approximately 750 employees while indirect employment is estimated at approximately 2,000 jobs.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria. Environmental, health and safety issues associated with this Project include past and present land use; sewage treatment and disposal; liquid and solid waste disposal; construction impacts; direct and indirect impacts on coastal resources and habitats; sustainable water supply; CFCs; employee safety training and emergency response; and fire protection measures.  The hotel will be equipped with an on-site waste water treatment plant and the Company is working with the Hotel Association of Playa Bávaro to identify a possible location for a sanitary landfill away from residential areas.  The construction of the hotel is not expected to affect the projects environment including the nearby mangroves.  The Company and the Hotel Association will jointly perform an evaluation of the aquifer that supplies water to the area to ensure proper usage of the aquifer.

(Premier), a subsidiary of Premier Oil Plc - 25%, Preussag Energie GmbH (Preussag) - 17.5% and IFC - 15% (collectively, the Joint Venture Partners).  Albpetrol is the state oil company of Albania.  Premier Oil Plc, of the United Kingdom, is an independent, publicly traded company involved in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas internationally.  Preussag, of Germany, is involved in the exploration, production and distribution of oil and natural gas internationally.Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment	The Project will be implemented by Anglo Albanian Petroleum Limited (AAP), a company owned by the Joint Venture Partners, at an estimated cost of US$257 million over six years.  IFC is to provide loans of approximately US$80 million to AAP, of which approximately US$50 million will be for the account of participants, and will invest approximately US$24 million in equity to acquire a 15% participating interest in the Project and to fund its share of Project cost.Location of Project and Description of Site	The Patos Marinza oil field is located 10 km east of the city of Fier in South Central Albania.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The Project involves the implementation of an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) scheme for the rehabilitation of part of the Patos Marinza oil field (Patos) including: the rehabilitation/stimulation of existing wells, drilling new wells, and construction of processing facilities and an approximately 22.5 km onshore export pipeline (the Export Pipeline) together with an offshore marine loading facility.  It is expected to result in an incremental peak production of about 19,000 barrels per day and the recovery up to 66 million barrels of crude oil.	This would represent IFCs first investment in Albanias oil and gas sector.  IFCs participation in the Project would, inter alia, allow it to (i) provide political comfort to Premier and Preussag, (ii) play a catalytic role in mobilizing commercial bank loans for the Project, and (iii) introduce western standards of environmental performance in Albanias oil and gas sector.  It would also signal IFCs support for the development of one of the countrys most important industrial sectors.	The Project would be the largest foreign investment in Albania to date.  Its successful implementation would (i) increase the country''s oil production thus helping Albania meet its energy needs; (ii) generate foreign exchange earnings through the renewal of crude oil exports thus helping alleviate the current financial crisis in Albania, and (iii) introduce modern technology suitable for the development/rehabilitation of the country''s oil fields. The Project will also generate significant environmental benefits for the country, especially the communities surrounding Patos, by eliminating past practices and introducing western standards of environmental performance.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category A project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure.  Environmental issues of potential concern are contamination of soil, surface water and groundwater as a result of prior oil production activities carried out by Albanian government oil agencies and companies, the remediation of existing contamination, the management of produced water and gas, routing of the Export Pipeline, increasing the environmental management capacity of the host country partner, community relations, worker health and safety, and site restoration.  The Project includes a comprehensive environmental baseline study of Patos, an environmental impact assessment (the first in Albania as required by the January 1993 Law on Environmental Protection) of the Export Pipeline to the Adriatic Sea and a comprehensive public consultation program for all components of the Project.  The Project will set the basis for a phased remediation of contaminated soil, surface  water and groundwater conditions in Patos while simultaneously increasing the production of oil in an environmentally appropriate manner.

The local partners include Trenco and Alexandria Tire Company, two Egyptian tire producers. Continental Carbon of the USA is the technical partner and the technology licensor for the proposed expansion as well as ACB''s existing production lines.  Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The estimated cost of the proposed expansion is US$34 million equivalent. IFC is considering a loan in the amount of US$7.5 million. Location of project and Description of site	ACB''s carbon clack plant is located in the new Amreya Industrial Zone, 35 kms. Southwest of Alexandria, easily accessible from the main Cairo-Alexandria road. Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The project is an expansion of ACB''s existing carbon black plant from its current capacity of 76,500 mt/yr to a total capacity of 115,000 mt/yr in order to cater for strong export demand from existing and new clients. IFC played a major role in bringing the original project and the first expansion into fruition. IFC''s continued involvement in the project is primarily aimed at reinforcing support for foreign direct investment in Egypt. This investment is also expected to consolidate ACB''s position as ""model"" company in terms of technology and performance, and reinforce the government''s intention of promoting Egyptian exports. Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure. Environmental issues associated with the project include air emissions, solid waste management and recycling of liquid effluents. Occupational health and safety issues include exposure to chemical substances and dust, fire safety, and general employee health, safety and training. The site is located  in a mixed industrial and agricultural area. There are no sensitive habitats near to the site. All process off gasses will be either fully combusted or filtered in baghouse filters. All air emissions will comply with both local requirements and World Bank guidelines.  A vacuum system is used to eliminate fugitive dust problems from the packing of final products. Domestic sewage from the plant will be treated in septic tank systems and later used for irrigation purposes inside the plant premises.  Process water, mainly consisting of cleaning waters and cooling water dumps will be treated in oil separators and settling ponds.  The cleaned process water is either reused in the plant or used for irrigation purposes at the premises.  The facility will only produce insignificant amounts of solid waste.  This waste will not be toxic and will be handled through the normal refuse handling organizations in the area.  The facility will be designed to meet local ambient noise requirements, which are more stringent than World Bank guidelines. Carbon black is a powder formed carbon based substance, but is not explosive or flammable under normal conditions, and has not been found toxic.  A vacuum extraction system has been introduced in the packaging section to limit employees exposure to carbon dust to a minimum.  Employees are provided with all necessary safety equipment including helmets, dust masks were necessary, hearing protection, etc.  The company has obtained both ISO 9002 certification for quality assurance and ISO 14001 certification for environmental management.  The company has prepared an emergency response plan and environmental management procedures and manuals.

Investments will be managed by an external team specializing in renewable energy financing and technical and program oversight under close supervision by IFC.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	$85-115 million with $25 million invested by IFC using GEF funds (investment on IFCs account to be determined on a case-by-case basis).  An additional $5 million in GEF funds is reserved for program implementation and administration.Location of project and Description of site	India (for investment of $15 million in GEF funds), Kenya ($5M), and Morocco ($5M) have been selected for PVMTI investments.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has provided $30 million in concessional funds to IFC to support investments in private sector projects to encourage market development for photovoltaics.  PVMTI will address market barriers by making available appropriate financing and stimulating business activity, accelerating PV penetration to achieve reductions in greenhouse gases.  By harnessing the innovation and discipline of the private sector in designing and implementing PV projects, IFC will help shift the design and financing of PV market activity to a more sustainable and replicable private sector context.

Alexandria National Iron and Steel (ANSDK) - Flat Steel Production,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Middle East and North Africa,"Egypt, Arab Republic of",ALEXANDRIA NATIONAL IRON & STEEL CO.,Regional Industry - MAS Africa,1998-03-06T05:00:00Z,"",B,Loan,"Summary Of Project Information (SPI)Project NameEgypt-Alexandria National Iron and Steel Company, S.A.E.Flat Steel ProjectRegionMiddle EastSectorProject No8638Projected Board DateApril 10, 1998Company NameAlexandria National Iron and Steel Company, S.A.E., ANSDK - the ""Company""Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders	ANSDKs main shareholders include a number of Egyptian public sector companies (64%), its Employees (14%), a Japanese Consortium (JC-10%) composed of Nippon Kokan, Kobe Steel and Toyo Menka Kaisha (renamed Tomen) and IFC (5%). In November 1997, the Company decided to increase its capital in two tranches in order to partly finance the proposed flat steel project. A number of public sector shareholders refrained from participating in the first tranche, which was implemented in December 1997, thereby diluting their combined shareholding from 64% to about 56%. Public sector shareholding is expected to further decrease to less than 50% after the second tranche of the capital increase is mobilized, thereby privatizing the Company. New private shareholders would include Schloemann-Siemag AG (SMS) of Germany, a major steel equipment supplier, which would own about 1.5% of ANDSKs final capital. The JC would maintain its shareholding to 10%, while the Employees would increase their share of ANSDKs final capital to about 16%. Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Project Cost of about US$625 million (including an IFC A loan of US$60 million, a B loan of about US$100 million and an equity investment of about US$11 million equivalent thereby maintaining IFCs present shareholding of 5%). Location of project and Description of site	Located in El-Dikheila, 15 km West of Alexandria, in Egypt, ANSDK is an integrated steel mill complex occupying an area of 1.4 million m near the Mediterranean coast. The proposed flat steel plant will be located on ANSDKs current premises, and will, as a result, benefit from the existing and well-provided infrastructure facilities. Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The proposed project consists of building a Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) based integrated flat steel plant, comprising a DRI furnace, electric steel making shop, thin slab caster, on-line hot strip mill and the necessary utility and other related facilities. The project, which benefits from the strong technical support of the JC and SMS, will produce flat products in the form of hot-rolled coils (HRC) to serve primarily the growing domestic market. HRC can be used as a finished product in a number of industries such as the construction, manufacturing, pipe-making or light engineering industries, and also as a feedstock for cold-rolled and coated steels. The demand for flat products in Egypt is currently met by a technologically obsolete and inefficient state-owned company, and imports.                                                                                                            The project supports the Government of Egypts privatization program. It will contribute to capital markets development and increased competitiveness of the manufacturing sector, as well as create about 535 new jobs and attract significant foreign direct investment to Egypt. The project is also expected to strengthen the domestic steel industry and develop the engineering industry, which is presently constrained by a lack of quality steel. This would be a strong generator of employment. Finally, the project would accelerate a transfer of technology and know-how of the highly complex flat steel production process.                                                                                        IFC assisted ANSDK in evaluating and making appropriate changes to the project configuration and cost. IFC is also assisting the company in implementing the financial plan, and is expected to play a catalytic role in helping the Company mobilize a major portion of the debt finance. IFC''s involvement is also essential to work out the arrangement for the privatization of the Company through dilution of the public sector shareholding.      Environmental Category and Issues	 This is an environmental review category B project; principal issues involve compliance of existing operations, air emissions, recycling of primary waste materials, liquid effluents, noise and company load on infrastructure, and environmental management and employee health and safety.  The sponsor has presented plans to address these issues and which demonstrate that the proposed project will comply with applicable governmental and World Bank requirements: The companys existing operations are in compliance with Egyptian and World Bank guidelines.  Dust emission control at the new Direct Reduction Plant (DRP) will include the use of a dry dedusting system.  Lime and limestone fines obtained during the process will be sold to cement industries.  ANSDKs air emissions will comply with Egyptian and World Bank guidelines.  The scrap produced in the steelmaking process is recycled into the process.  ANSDKs slag is crushed and separated.  Hereby, metals are extracted and residual slag is sold to the construction industry for asphalt, and concrete filling as well as for road stabilization material.  ANSDK has a domestic sewage and an industrial wastewater treatment system.  The effluent discharges meet local regulations and World Bank guidelines.  The noise level at the DRP will be reduced by enclosing the compressor, and the steelmaking plant will be designed to reduce the sound power level.  ANSDKs management has recently created an environmental department to direct and manage all the activities related to environment, health and safety issues at the plant.  The company provides employees with appropriate personal protective equipment.The  is  from the Public Information Center.Date SPI sent to PIC March 6, 1998This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

The project will improve the availability of quality residential space in Kampala, and supply much needed infrastructure.  The lack of residential space of international quality deprives Uganda of an element that is essential to promote economic growth.  IFC is one of the few sources of long term financing in Uganda.  IFCs participation will assist in completing the financial plan.  Although the sponsors are experienced property developers, this is their first project in Uganda and the first targeted to the rental market.  IFCs support enabled them to go through the government approval process quickly and IFCs technical consultants suggestions have improved the project specifications and market focus.This is an environmental review category B project.  Environmental and occupational health and safety issues include land use, sewage treatment/disposal, liquid and solid waste disposal, construction materials, power and water supply, CFCs, fire safety measures, and employee training and general safety.  The complex will be connected to Kampalas municipal services for water supply and sewage disposal and power will be supplied from the national/local grid.  Any onsite electrical equipment or transformers will be PCB-free.  Fuel storage will be provided with secondary containment.  Solid waste will be disposed of by the municipality.  All cold storage and air conditioning systems will be CFC-free.  The sponsor is committed to compliance with World Bank fire safety guidelines and a specialized fire safety firm has been retained by the sponsor to conduct an independent fire safety audit.Date SPI sent to PIC:		March 12, 1998For additional Invormation contact:  Corporate relations Unit -				Telephone:	(202) 473-7711				Facsimile:	(202) 676-0365Environmental documents for this project are available at http://www.ifc.org and from the World Bank InfoShop (http://www.worldbank.org/html/pic/aboutinfo.html).","","","","","","","","","","","","","",1.0 million (USD)Product LineIFC Investment (million USD)Risk ManagementGuaranteeLoan1.0Equity* These investment figures are indicative,"","","","","","",8726,"",AA - Construction and Real Estate,"","","",""

(Turkish Petroleum Company), and Unocal Corporation.  The Early Oil Project involves the development of part of the Chirag field, and is the first step in the full development of the group of three fields known as Azeri, Chirag and deep-water Gunashli.  Production from the Early Oil Project is expected to reach 105,000 barrels per day(bpd) by the year 2000.  Azerbaijan will also receive significant quantities of associated natural gas from the Project, which will reduce the gas deficit in the country.  The Project will have a positive impact on local industry and employment and will provide essential support for Azerbaijans economic recovery program.  Georgia will receive the benefits of substantial investment in export pipeline and terminal infrastructure, and will also obtain transit fee income from oil transported across its territory.  Russia has signed a contract to export oil from Azerbaijan and will also receive tariff income from transport of oil from the Project.  IFCs role in this Project is to: (i) provide long term financing, which is not currently available in Azerbaijan or Georgia, (ii) mobilize financing from international commercial banks, and (iii) mitigate cross-border and other perceived political risks.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category A project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  Environmental areas of concern with respect to the project include: existing hydrocarbon contamination to soil, surface water and ground water along existing pipelines and at sites for new facilities; knowledge of terrestrial resources as well as cultural properties and significant natural habitats; oil spills; the management of produced water and gas and worker health and safety.  Environmental audits of existing contamination have been completed and appropriate remediation programs are in place.  Several environmental baseline and sensitivity studies have been completed and several more are ongoing so as to characterize and understand existing environmental conditions. Six separate EIAs have been completed for the various components of the Project.  The information on potential impacts and suggested mitigation in these EIAs have been used by AIOC to prepare the Projects operating procedures for both routine and non-routine activities.  The EIAs have also provided key data for the Projects environmental plan.  A three tiered oil spill response plan is in place for the Caspian Sea. Therefore, the Project will bring to the Caspian Sea an international standard response plan.  Specifications on the quality of produced water allowed to be discharged to the Caspian Sea are included in the Projects Production Sharing Agreement.  Produced gas will be collected by AIOC and delivered to SOCAR, which will facilitate the commercial use of this gas.  AIOC has health, safety and environmental management systems that have been developed in accordance with the guidelines of the E&P Forum for the oil exploration and production industry.  The EIA process has included extensive consultation with a variety of stakeholders.  The EIAs were released to the Infoshop on February 18, 1998.

Silvi Nova is a Swedish consulting and management company, equally owned by Messrs. Ake Jacobson, Hugo Berch, and Peter Fogde.   Mr. Sumphorn Manodham and Mr. Southitham are Lao citizens with extensive experience in Lao PDR and elsewhere in the agro-forestry industry.Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment	US$ 2.9 million including an IFC Loan of up to US$ 1.1 millionLocation of Project and Description of Site	 The Project site will be located at Nabong, less than one-hours drive from Vientiane and close to most of BAFCOs plantations.  The site is a flat piece of land on which BAFCO has a sublease up to the year 2012 with an option to renew.   The land is central to the plantation and is serviced with electricity and well water. IFCs engineering and environmental staff have visited the site and find it suitable.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	BAFCO will produce glue laminated board (gluelam) for use as furniture components for export to Europe and Asia. Air dried and kiln dried sawn lumber will also be sold to the local construction sector. BAFCO already has some 700 hectares of eucalyptus plantations which were planted in the 1990s.  These plantations will provide about 40% of the Projects log supply requirements in the Projects initial years, increasing to 67% within six years. IFC and the IFC- managed Mekong Project Development Facility have played an important role in the Project by reviewing the technical, strategic, financial, environmental, and legal arrangements.  Under the Extending IFCs Reach Initiative, IFC is one of the few sources of long-term capital for Lao projects. The Project supports the Lao Governments policy to promote private sector projects and, more specifically, projects which foster the preservation of Laos natural forests and the efficient use of Laos resources to produce value-added products.   By increasing the stump value of the plantation wood, BAFCO will encourage further development of private, farm-based plantation forestry, thereby contributing to the conservation of native forests and preservation of the environment.  In addition, BAFCO will allow farmers to generate income using land that in many parts of Lao is degraded and no longer suitable for food crops.  As the first eucalyptus gluelam unit in Lao, the Project will also introduce a new product and technology into the country while generating foreign exchange earnings and increased tax revenues. Environmental Category and Issues	This a category B project according to according to IFC''s environmental review procedure because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines, or design criteria.  The following potential environmental, safety and health impacts of the project were analyzed: wood supply source and management; air emissions; solid waste management; hazardous materials storage and handling; fire prevention and emergency response; and employee health and safety, and training.Wood will be sourced from BAFCO''s existing eucalyptus plantations or will be purchased from other small eucalyptus plantations nearby.  No timber from natural forest areas will be purchased without the specific prior written approval of the IFC.  Air emissions including particulates from the wood-fired boiler and dust from sawing and planing activities will be controlled through appropriate technology to meet World Bank Group guidelines.  The solid wood wastes generated by the plant will fuel the boiler for the drying kiln.  Standard and reasonable fire detection and protection and worker health and safety measures will be implemented, including worker training in relevant aspects.  The project will be comply will the relevant World Bank Group policies and guidelines. IFC will monitor ongoing compliance during the lifetime of the Project by evaluating reports submitted annually to IFC by BAFCO and by conducting periodic supervision.The  is  from the Public Information Center.

The Company began the investment program in 1997 and expects to complete the investment program by year-end 1999.Location of project and Description of site	MDG''s existing banana plantations (Marsman Estate Plantation, Alta Vista and Nova Vista) are in the province of Davo del Norte and within a 100Km radius from Davo City.  The largest of these, Marsman Estate Plantation, is a 1,300 hectare plantation which has been in operation for 28 years.  The site of the new 1,000 ha banana operation is in the province of South Cotobato, Mindanao, on a land comprising mainly coarse grassland and shrub with small areas of low grade cultivation.  Asparagus, Papaya, and Okra operations are in Southern Mindanao near the towns of Tupi and Polomolok where the lands are found at an elevation of 320 to 400 metres above sea level providing a suitable temperature for the cultivation of asparagus and okra.  MDAVI has contracted with local farmers who now have 377 hectares under cultivation.Description of Company and Purpose of ProjectThe Project consists of a US$35.3 million expansion and diversification program for the food and agribusiness operations of the Marsman-Drysdale Group (""MDG).  The proposed Project entails a) expansion and renovation of banana production operations, including an expansion of the production of organic bananas (i.e. produced without pesticides and fertilizers), b) expansion of asparagus and mango production, c) diversification into okra and papaya production, d) addition of on-site processing equipment to improve crop utilization, and e) re-financing of US$13.0 million in short-term debt of the Company.  Almost all production from the Project will be for export, mainly to oapan, China, and the Middle East.The Marsman-Drysdale Group (""MDG"" or the ""Group"") is a diversified Philippine family-owned conglomerate established more than 75 years ago by the Marsman family.  The Group''s core activities include: food/agribusiness, marketing and distribution of consumer goods, real estate, mining, travel and tourism and telecommunications. Total MDG turnover was US55.0 million in 1996, and is projected to exceed US$80.0 million in 1997.  Total assets of the Group were US$113.2 million as of December 31, 1996.       The economic benefits of the Project include enhanced land productivity, increased value-addition to products through the food processing component, expansion of the fiscal base, and an increase in foreign exchange earnings of US$5.4 million annually in a country where foreign exchange reserves have been severely limited due to the ongoing regional economic crisis.  Also, the Project provides additional direct employment for over 1,900 persons on the island of Mindanao, including approximately 750 jobs at contract growers (of asparagus, papaya, and okra) who would otherwise be unable to access the Japanese market.        IFC is providing valuable long-term financing to a local company which would otherwise lack access to longer-term funding for its capital investments.  IFC''s financing is also expected to provide additional comfort to potential new customers and providers of trade finance in the difficult economic environment which continues to prevail in the Asia region.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.  Key environmental, occupational health and safety issues that were reviewed for this project included: proper treatment and disposal of liquid and solid wastes and gaseous emissions; use and handling of agricultural chemicals and other hazardous materials throughout the production cycle; use of CFCs in cooling and refrigeration equipment; and fire protection and general worker health and safety.

Ipeks current total paper production capacity is 37,000 tons per year with two paper machines.  Ipek proposes to add a third paper machine of about 50,000 tons per year at its existing tissue mill in Karamursel, an industrial site located about 100 km from Istanbul.  The Project would thus increase Ipeks total tissue paper capacity up to 87,000 tons per year. The new paper machine is expected to be operational in the first half of year 2000.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The proposed project will assist a second tier company in Turkey. Through the proposed quasi-equity investment, IFC will assist the Company in taking the first steps towards its eventual public offering, an important step in developing the countrys capital markets.  The project provides an opportunity to support a growing company which would otherwise have no access to adequate long-term financing at reasonable terms.  The availability (in terms of volume) and suitability (in terms of rate and maturity) of local long-term financing for the proposed expansion project would be very limited.  Without IFCs investment, Ipek would be forced to postpone the project or rely on expensive short-term financing.

Mr. Nammour is a highly experienced businessman in the hospitality industry with a number of successful hotels and restaurants in Lebanon, the U.S. and France.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Total project cost is estimated at US$40 million.  IFC''s proposed investment consists of a US$13 million loan and a US$1.5 million equity investment.Location of project and Description of site	The project consists of the construction of 3 hotels and 4 restaurants in Beirut.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Idarat is a diversified company involved in the tourism sector in Lebanon, holding interests in a number of hotels and restaurants in the country.  Since its creation in the early 1990s, Idarat has been consistently growing and is now considered to be the prime provider of tourism facilities in Lebanon.  The Companys current investment program consists of developing 2 hotels and 4 restaurants in Beirut.  The proposed IFC corporate loan would be used to fund the Companys investment program as well as to restructure the Companys balance sheet.  It also provides for a loan to Société de Vinci, a group company, for the completion of its sole asset, the Albergo hotel.IFCs main role in this project will be to provide long-term funding to the project which is crucial for the rehabilitation of this capital-intensive sector.  Having limited access to term resources, the local banking system is unable to provide such funding in any significant amount which partly explains the limited number of hotels built after the end of the war in 1990.  Prior to the war, tourism accounted for some 20% of the country''s GDP but is now estimated to account for no more than 7% as a result of the widespread destruction to the tourism industry during the war.  The project is expected to greatly contribute to the resurgence of tourism as a key sector in Lebanons economy.

IE is a Spanish corporation that is involved in the development and promotion of investments, particularly those related to the cement sector.  IE is 50% owned by Corporacion Gestamp, a Spanish industrial group controlled by the Riberas Family, which also holds a majority stake in the Spanish Gonvarri Group.  The Gonvarri Group is a prominent industrial group in Spain, with a turnover in 1996 of US$ 1.2 billion and interests in the automotive components, steel, and cement sectors.Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment	The estimated project cost is US$ 242 million.  The proposed IFC investment consists of an A Loan of up to US$ 30 million for IFCs own account, a B Loan of up to US$ 50 million for the account of Participants, a C Loan for IFCs own account, and an equity investment of up to US$ 5 million. The investment is structured to consist of two phases.Location of Project and Description of Site	The project is located in Devnya Cements current plant site near the port of Varna-West on the Black Sea coast.  The limestone quarry is 15 km from the factory site, and the limestone is transported to the plant by a conveyor belt 11 km in length.Description of Company and Purpose of Project		Cement is a key requirement for developing Bulgarias infrastructure.  The proposed investment would be IFCs first investment in the cement sector in Bulgaria.  The Project involves the renovation and expansion of Devnya´s operating existing capacity of about 1.0 million tpa cement plant.  The Project includes:  i) the privatization/acquisition of a majority stake in the Company from the government; ii) upgrading and expansion of existing equipment of the plant; and iii) the installation of a 1.0 million tpa dry process cement line.	The Project will allow an inefficient and environmentally unsound plant to be modernized and upgraded.  The project is an export-oriented project and, as such, will increase the foreign exchange earnings of Bulgaria and will serve as a positive example for the Governments privatization campaign.  Moreover, the project will assist in the modernization of a post-privatized company.  The local staff of the Company will receive first hand training and direct experience in the management and operations of an international-standard cement plant.  Technology transfer will also occur in the construction of the project itself, where advanced project management techniques will be used, and local suppliers will be held to international standards.  Finally, the Project has an important environmental component which would enable the Company to comply with the World Bank guidelines upon project completion.	IFC was instrumental to the structuring of the transaction, and provided advice on key market and technical issues.  IFC has significant experience in the cement sector in Europe and the Middle East, having financed cement projects throughout the region.  Drawing from this experience, IFC has provided substantial advice to the Project on technical and operational matters, which resulted in modifications and improvements to the Project.  IFCs engineer also provided the Company with constructive feedback and guidance regarding the additional cement line that the Company is installing.  The Company is unable to obtain long-term project financing from private sources without the presence of a multilateral institution such as IFC.  As such, IFCs involvement would provide a catalytic effect for private investment in Bulgaria.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedures.  Environmental, occupational health and safety issues associated with this project include:  air emissions, treatment of process and domestic wastewater, solid waste disposal, fire prevention and protection, and workplace health and safety.  The Company has agreed to meet all applicable World Bank environmental and health and safety guidelines.  Air emissions from the process will be controlled by the installation of dust collectors.  Process water is recirculated therefore, there are no liquid effluent discharges to the environment.  The sponsor will implement occupational health and safety measures and will provide the relevant environmental information needed to assess and ensure that the ports will be built according to World Bank guidelines and policies.The  is  from the InfoShopDate SPI sent to InfoShop April 16, 1998This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

(the ""Company"") will be owned by Mr. John Predl (51%) and by his wife, Mrs. Minichanh Boulyaphol (49%).  Mr. Predl has about eight years of experience running an embroidery business in Australia.  Ms. Boulyaphol is a skilled embroidery machine operator and supervisor who is familiar with Barudan''s machines.  Barudan Asia Pvt. Ltd. will take preferred shares in the Company worth approximately US$ 104,000.  Barudan Asia Pvt. Ltd. is a fully owned subsidiary of Barudan Japan which is the embroidery machine supplier to the Project.Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment	US$471,000 including an IFC Loan of up to US$235,000Location of Project and Description of Site	The Project will be located in Vientiane, about 10 kilometers from the city center.  A new factory building 16 meters by 17 meters would be built on the ground of Atlanta Enterprises, a large manufacturer of garments.  The site is flat and there is sufficient space for expansion.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The Company will build a modern semi-automated embroidery unit in Vientiane and service the Lao garment export sector with higher quality and more reliable embroidery services.  The export garment sector in Lao PDR is comprised of about 46 producers exporting products.  However, currently, many Lao garment manufacturers are either forced to turn down export orders or send garments out to Vietnam or Cambodia for embroidering due to the lack of modern embroidery capacities in Lao PDR.  By investing in proven technology, the Company can enable local garment makers to attract orders at a higher price level from quality international brands in the sportswear and leisurewear markets.  These products will mainly be for European buyers whose markets demand a high level of finished quality at economic costs.  IFC and the IFC- managed Mekong Project Development Facility have played an important role in the Project by reviewing the technical, strategic, financial, environmental, and legal arrangements.  Under the Extending IFCs Reach Initiative, IFC is one of the few sources of long-term capital for Lao projects.  The Project supports the Lao Governments policy to promote private sector projects and encourage development of the garment industry.  Moreover, by providing embroidery to ISO9001 standards, the Project would provide a demonstaration effect to others in this sector.  The Project will also contribute to generating foreign exchange earnings and increased tax revenues. Environmental Category and Issues	This a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines, or design criteria.  IFCs Technical and Environmental Department staffs review of this project consisted of appraising technical and environmental information submitted by the project sponsor.

Adana Cements largest shareholder is Ordu Yardimlasma Kurumu (OYAK), a pension fund for the officers of the Turkish Armed Forces. Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment	The Project Cost is estimated at US$ 88.0 million.  IFCs proposed investment consists of an A Loan of US$ 15.0 million and a B Loan of 10.0 million.Location of Project and Description of Site	The Project is located at the Companys existing plant site in Adana, Turkey.  Adana Cement benefits from a strategic location that provides access to limestone and other key raw materials (limestone and clay quarries are at the factory site), plus access to transportation via a port within 100 km in Iskenderun.Description of Company and Purpose of Project(include IFCs Role and Development Impact)	The Project involves:  i) the modernization of Adana Cements cement grinding capacity by the conversion of one raw mill into a cement mill; ii) the upgrading of raw material milling and blending facilities; and iii) the installation of a 30 MW captive generation plant to secure its electricity needs.  The Project will reduce Adana Cements energy costs, ensure a stable supply of electricity, provide additional cement grinding capacity, ensure better product quality, and provide some environmental improvements. The Project will be located at the Companys existing facility in Adana, Turkey.  Project completion is estimated by December 1999.	The project provides an opportunity to support a growing company which, without IFCs participation, would not have access to adequate medium nor long-term financing.  Without IFCs investment, under the present economic environment in Turkey, Adana would be forced to rely on more expensive short-term financing which would squeeze its cash generation. More generally, by providing financing and mobilizing long-term funds from commercial banks, IFC demonstrates that limited-recourse financing is possible in Turkey, and creates a model for future transactions.  In addition to providing financing, IFC would support a project in Southeastern Turkey, a largely under-developed region (see below). 	Moreover, IFC has significant experience in the cement sector in Europe and the Middle East, having financed cement projects throughout the region.  Drawing from this experience, IFC has provided advice to the Project on technical and operational matters, which resulted in some modifications and improvements to the Project.  From a broader perspective, IFCs role as a risk-taking multilateral institution provides comfort to other lenders and potential future investors.	The proposed project is in Southeastern Turkey, a region which is largely under-developed and where there are large per capita income differences with Western Turkey. In this regard, IFCs investment would play an important role in assisting a Company whose modernization would have a substantial impact on the economic development of the region. The Project will have two major positive impacts on the cement sector.  First, it will boost competition, which will result in better quality cement and lower prices.  This will, in turn, lower building and infrastructure costs.  Second, it will help advance the process of phasing out the older production units which are energy inefficient and often detrimental to the environment.  Furthermore, the Project would improve the Companys export capability, allowing it more flexibility in exploiting market opportunities.  Finally, the Project has an important environmental component which would enable the Company to comply with all IBRD guidelines upon project completion.Environmental Category and Issues	This a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  The environmental issues associated with this project include: air emissions, treatment of wastewater, and revegetation of quarries.  Health and safety issues include accident prevention and employee exposure to noise.  Dust emissions from the recently completed precalcination line are currently well below the World Banks guidelines of 50 mg dust /Nm3.  The Project will bring all operations into compliance with World Bank guidelines at completion.

The project site is a vacant property situated on the bank of the Bhairab River, and is adjacent to an existing power station and an oil tank farm.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The project consists of a 110 MW power plant to be developed under a build, own, operate scheme.  The project would initially run on residual fuel oil, to be converted to natural gas as soon as it is available.  The electricity to be produced will be sold to the Bangladesh Power Development Board, the national utility, on the basis of a 15 year PPA.  The project will be one of the first IPPs to be implemented under the new Government of Bangladesh guidelines for private power projects.  At about 80 kWh, Bangladesh is among the lowest in developing countries in terms of electricity generated per capita, and its distribution network serves only about 15% of the population. As Bangladesh has enjoyed steady growth in recent years, the infrastructure to supply electricity to the economy has not kept pace with this growth.  Reliability of electricity supply, which has been a growing problem over the years, has now reached crisis proportions.  Peak demand is about 2700 MW, whereas available generation is about 2000 MW.  The demand supply imbalance has now become a major bottleneck to economic growth.  The Khulna power project, which is expected to be completed within 12 months, is a fast-track response to the power shortage situation.  IFC''s participation in the project, including its proposed B Loan umbrella protection, is critical to mobilize adequate debt financing from the market.  Environmental Category and Issues	This is an environmental review category B project. Environmental and social issues associated with the project include: site selection and land use, site contamination from past activities, air emissions and noise from construction and plant operation, liquid effluents, liquid and solid waste disposal, oil transportation safety and spill potential, social impacts, fire prevention and emergency response, employee health and safety programs, and impact management and monitoring. KPC has prepared an environmental assessment for the project to address these issues and demonstrate that the proposed project will comply with applicable governmental and World Bank requirements. The proposed site for the project was identified by BPDB in their RFP for the project. The project is located on an uninhabited, vacant property owned by PADMA, the state oil company. No resettlement of residents or economic displacement was required.During operations the proposed power plant''s emissions will meet the World Bank emission guidelines. The predicted ambient pollutant levels contributed by the proposed power plant are within all Bangladesh standards and World Bank guidelines on a stand-alone basis. The site is adjacent to an existing power plant, and modeling of the emissions from the existing and proposed plants indicates that World Bank guidelines for ground level concentrations of SO2 (24 hour average) would be exceeded. Means to mitigate these relatively minor effects on ground level SO2 concentrations so that there will be no net decrease in ambient air quality are being further investigated by the sponsor. Noise monitoring will be carried out upon completion of the proposed plant to confirm compliance with recommended noise guidelines or recommend mitigation measures should they prove necessary. All effluents to water from the site are expected to comply with World Bank and Bangladesh guidelines.Socioeconomic impacts are largely beneficial ones, including the positive, short-term impact on employment and local businesses as a result of construction activities, the bringing of a reliable source of electricity to the area, and the establishing of a Social Goodwill Fund to be made available to the local community for its general benefit.The  is  from the Public Information Center.Date SPI sent to PIC April 28, 1998This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

IFCs proposed investment is expected to be in the form of up to US$4 million in an A Loan and a Subordinated C loan of up to US$0.5 million.Location of project and Description of site	The project will be located in Managua.	Description of Company and Purpose of Project	La Colonia is Nicaraguas largest retail supermarket chain, with 5 stores located in Managua. La Colonia''s four-year Project will involve the following components:(i) opening 3 new La Colonia supermarkets in Managua; (ii) remodeling and modernizing three existing stores, (iii) introducing an integrated electronic point of sale system (EPOS), and (iv) upgrading management information systems. The Company expects to benefit from higher margins (as a result of improved efficiencies and economies of scale), to streamline and run more technologically-efficient operations, and improve its competitive position, while at the same time preempting local and foreign competitors wishing to enter the market. IFCs financing provides La Colonia with long-term funding which would otherwise be limited and expensive through other sources for companies in Nicaragua. In addition, IFC could serve as a catalyst to encourage greater foreign investment in the Company.  IFCs participation would also improve the Companys corporate governance through improved reporting and better management practices, while acting as an agent of change in its expansion plans. La Colonia''s Project is expected to have the following developmental impacts: (i) the Companys expansion plans would assist in distributing to the Managuan population groups a wider variety of food and other basic necessity items (at lower or competitive prices) under cleaner and more hygienic conditions. The Project would introduce best practice and modern retailing methods, and bring about technological improvements in logistics and distribution systems; and (ii) the Project will create about 250 jobs, primarily for women, contributing to reducing the high level of unemployment and underemployment in the country. In addition, the Project would also provide uncommon employee-benefit packages and higher than average compensation rates.  The expansion plans would also foster better academical standards and training, and create career opportunities for the Companys employees and management, thereby improving the standards of living in the region in which it will operate. 	Environmental Category and Issues	This is an environmental review category B project.  Potential issues which were reviewed for this project included land use and site location, liquid effluents treatment and discharge, solid waste management, use of non-CFC refrigerants, fire protection, safety and emergency response and general worker health and safety.  The sponsor will implement actions to address these issues and demonstrate that the Project will comply with applicable Nicaraguan requirements and World Bank guidelines.  Liquid effluents are properly disposed.  Solid residues will be either recycled or properly disposed according to local regulations.  Non-CFC refrigerants will be used.  The sponsor is reviewing the current safety and emergency response practices and will implement actions satisfactory to IFC.  Employees will be trained in occupational health and industrial safety practices.

Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment	$240 million project cost.  IFC proposes an A Loan of $35 million, a B Loan of up to $10 million and equity of $10 million.Location of Project and Description of Site	An integrated, dry process cement plant will be built on the north-west bank of the Surma River at Chhatak, Sylhet district, in the far north-east corner of Bangladesh very close to the border with the Indian state of Meghalaya.  There are no cement grade deposits of limestone in Bangladesh but it is in plentiful supply in Meghalaya.  Thus a limestone quarrying and crushing operation will be established in Meghalaya to serve the cement plant and the two centres of operations will be connected by an overhead belt conveyor.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Lafarge is the second largest cement producer in the world with over 75 operating plants in 45 countries.  Lafarge will bring to bear state-of-the-art technology, operational know-how and superior management skills.  Domestic competition in the cement industry in Bangladesh will be intensified.  The project reflects a pioneering role for Lafarge and its backers in Bangladesh.  It will demonstrate to other world-class foreign companies and local businessmen that large viable projects can be undertaken in Bangladesh and can be financed on acceptable terms. Permanent jobs will be created for some 282 local employees in Bangladesh and Meghalaya who will receive training from Lafarge. Initially, seven expatriates will be permanently based in the country.  The planned investment of US$20 million in Meghalaya is significant for that small Indian state and will enable it to add value to a bountiful natural resource that otherwise has little economic value due to the states own tiny market and remoteness from the rest of India.  IFCs presence will provide comfort to a major foreign direct investor and IFC will take a prominent role in the group of multilateral and bilateral development finance institutions which are willing to support the project.  IFC will also be actively involved in helping to negotiate and structure the cross-border trade aspects of the project. Environmental Category and Issues	Category A.

Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The cost for the first two phases of the project, which includes 2 x 150MW simple cycle gas turbine generators and a transmission line reinforcement component, is currently estimated at US$215 million. The proposed IFC investment consists of: (i) a senior IFC ''A'' Loan of up to US$35 million, (ii) a senior IFC ''B'' Loan of up to US$35 million; (iii) an IFC Quasi Equity investment of up to US$9 million; (iv) an IFC Equity subscription of up to US$2 million; and, (v) optional risk management and/or backstopping facilities of up to US$5 million equivalent. Location of project and Description of site	The project is located at Azito on the Ebrie Lagoon, in the Yopougon district about 10km southwest of downtown Abidjan. The 70,600 sq.m. project site is on undeveloped land, remote from any densely populated area and at proximity to Abidjan''s 225kV transmission ring. Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The project is to build, own, operate and eventually transfer a 450MW nominal gas-fired power station to be implemented in three 150MW phases. Financing is currently being arranged for the first two 150MW phases only. Cinergy is a private special purpose company that will provide power to the Ivorian electricity utility under a 23-year Concession Agreement. The project will initially increase domestic generation capacity by about 30%, meeting the severe power shortage otherwise anticipated in 2000. Using offshore natural gas as fuel, Cinergy will be one of the lowest cost generators in Africa, and will enable Côte d''Ivoire to attract industrial investment and sustain its strong economic growth. IFC is playing a key role in structuring the financing, and through the proposed IFC ''B'' Loan will provide the first commercial bank financing for private infrastructure in Sub-Saharan Africa.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category A project under IFC''s environmental review procedure. Environmental issues associated with the project include siting considerations, stack emissions and air quality impacts, liquid effluent and water intake, noise, socio-economic impacts including resettlement of people, construction of associated facilities such as transmission lines and a gas pipeline, and occupational health and safety.  	The Environmental Assessment and the Resettlement Plan (three families from the plant site, and about 130 families with regard to the right-of-way acquisition of the transmission line) were prepared including the results of public consultations. These documents were released to World Bank InfoShop in April 1998. The Resettlement Plan was released to the InfoShop with the proviso that organizational responsibilities, implementation schedule, and budget be provided in more detail by the end of May 1998. 	The use of natural gas will result in inherently low SOx and particulate emissions. The main stack height will be 30m (50m for the combined-cycle 3rd phase). Various noise control measures including an acoustic enclosure, silencers, and a tree screen will be applied. The closed-circuit cooling water system (for the combined-cycle 3rd phase) with cooling towers will minimize the amount of water-intake. The transmission line route (16km) was selected from four alternative routes in consideration of minimizing social impacts. An Environmental Assessment for the associated gas pipeline is being carried out by a gas supplier under contract to the Government.

The state owns 35% of CCCL, individuals own 35% and legal entities own 30%.  The legal entities can be further categorized into 4 groups: (i) 5 listed companies own 16.8% of CCCL. Their weighted average state ownership is 27.4%; (ii) a cooperative (95% owned by CCCLs employees) holds 7.2% of CCCLs shares; (iii) CITIC, a state-owned financial institution owns 3.9% of CCCL; and (iv) other legal entities own the remaining 2.3% of CCCLs shares.  Each of them holds less than 0.2% of CCCL.Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment	The total project cost is US$29.7 million.  IFC''s proposed investment is US$3.2 million in the form of equity, an A loan of US$7.4 million, and a B loan of US$8.6 million.Location of Project and Description of SiteThe project is to (i) build an additional 12,000 tons per annum (tpa) potassium carbonate (K2CO3) production line, including a 10,000 tpa potassium hydroxide (KOH) line,  (KOH is an intermediate in the production of K2CO3); and (ii) increase production of KOH flake by 10,000 tpa. CCCL''s existing site has limited facility for the new production lines.  The project will be located at the Jianjiang Chemical Plant site in Jiuchi Town, Pengzhou City, a satellite city of Chengdu.  It is about 40 km north of Chengdu, and 35 km from the existing plant.  The site area covers 193,430 square meters, 27,100 of which are reserved for the potassium hydroxide/carbonate expansion project. This site is within an industrial estate and has good access roads, good water supply and proximity to railroad.  The area has been designated by the Provincial and Municipal Governments as the heavy industry zone within the great Chengdu City area.  Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Chengdu Chemical Company, Ltd. (CCCL) is China''s leading manufacturer of potassium based chemicals, located in Chengdu, Sichuan Province.  Currently the Company produces 17,000 tpa of KOH from two production lines, of which 10,000 tons are used internally to produce 12,000 tons of K2CO3. The Company also produces 10,000 tpa of caustic soda (NaOH).  A new line of 10,000 tpa high purity KOH flake, using the same membrane cell electrolysis technology as the existing lines, has just been constructed, started production in April 1998, and is expected to be in commercial operation in July 1998.	The Project will improve CCCL''s competitiveness and help it maintain its market leadership through (a) expanding production capacity to allow CCCL to further improve its economies of scale and meet the increasing demand of K2CO3; (b) adding high purity KOH flake (which has been provided by imports up to now) to its product slate to make CCCL the first, and presently, the only hgih purity KOH flake producer in China. The demand for KOH flake is expanding in the Chinese household chemicals, textile, dye, and food industries, and the product offers attractive margins. In addition, the project contributes to import substitution, both for raw material and end products, and it promotes sector development in two interior Chinese regions: Sichuan where the Project is located and Qinghai where raw materials are sourced.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  Environmental, occupational health, and safety issues associated with this Project include: site suitability, air emissions, wastewater treatment, solid waste handling, and process plant safety.  The site is located within an industrial area.  Air emissions are limited due to efficient absorption of off-gasses, and import of power instead of own production.  Wastewater is treated on-site and solid waste is delivered to other companies for recycling.  The plant will have automatic gas release monitoring and alarms.  The Project has received necessary approvals from Chinese environmental authorities.

It is the worlds largest producer of control systems and products used to regulate and control heating and air conditioning in commercial buildings, and of systems to control industrial processes. The companys advanced-technology products, systems and services provide customers with benefits, such as energy conservation, environmental protection, improved productivity, enhanced consumer comfort and increased safety. The Company employed approximately 57,500 persons in total operations as of December 31, 1997, with about 30,300 employees in the United States.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	About US$240 million, over four years, for five ESCOs in five countries.  IFC investment will comprise: (a) an equity investment of up to US$25 million;  (b) A-loan up to US$30 million; and (c) B-Loan on an ESCO-by ESCO basis, as needed.Location of project and Description of siteFive countries (subject to change), beginning in PolandDescription of Company and Purpose of ProjectThe Honeywell ESCO MPF involves the establishment over a four year period of five or more ESCOs globally (initially targeting Poland).  Each ESCO will provide energy efficiency-related services for private sector business and public sector entities to reduce the energy and maintenance costs of such businesses and entities.(a)	Description of ESCO Business:  The Multi-Project Facility (MPF) will finance the establishment and operation of one ESCO in each country. For this purpose, IFC will enter into an MPF Framework Agreement with the sponsor (Honeywell) that will, through its local subsidiaries, provide turnkey project installation, services, performance guarantees, and management services to the local ESCOs. Typically, the ESCOs will enter into Energy Services Contracts (ESCs) with customers, and will provide a range of energy efficiency services.  To fulfil all technical commitments under these contracts, the ESCOs will enter into contracts with Honeywells local subsidiaries for turnkey installation, energy efficiency services, performance guarantees, and management services, as needed.  In addition to multilateral financing, the ESCOs will seek financing from domestic capital markets, wherever feasible.(b)	Purpose of the Project: There is a great need for energy efficiency upgrades and retrofits in the Central and Eastern European region and in other countries where Honeywell is developing ESCO operations.  These needs are driven by the technical and financial potential for energy efficiency, the need to transfer and apply the best and most suitable technologies, the need for project development and management expertise, the need to mobilize capital for projects, the need to remove institutional barriers, and the ESCO''s ability to integrate these various elements. Honeywells ESCO strategy is designed to consolidate its efforts to promote energy efficiency and savings (on energy, maintenance, and avoided repair and replacement costs) for the end users, provide a high profile signal of its commitment to this market, create a vehicle to mobilize corporate and project financing, and formalize long-term relationships with local partners.  Honeywell''s strong reputation, base of reference projects in the region, technical expertise, and financial soundness to offer credible energy efficiency projects will support the ESCOs marketing, and generally promote energy efficiency and conservation efforts by the private sector in these target regions.Environmental Category and IssuesThis is a category FI project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  Honeywell has committed to establish an environmental management system that will ensure that each ESCOs investments are consistent with applicable host country environmental laws and regulations as well as applicable World Bank environmental, health and safety guidelines and policies; designate appropriate individuals who will have responsibility for environment; have these individuals attend IFCs environmental management workshops; ensure that Category A projects are cleared by IFCs Environmental Division; and submit an annual environmental performance report.

By locating this plant in the interior, the sponsors will contribute to the development of a productive rural area of the country. The project will expand availability to local consumers of locally produced mineral water, whose quality will be in compliance with European standards. The company will create 60 jobs and distribute close to US$200,000 of wages/year.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to AEF''s environmental review procedure. Environmental issues associated with this project include site and land use, liquid and solid waste management, storage of chemicals and hazardous materials, and sustainability and quality of the aquifer. Occupational health, and safety issues include occupational health and safety, fire safety and noise emissions. 	The sponsor has presented plans to address these issues:  The plant is located in the future industrial zone of Bonoua  and comprises office space and the processing unit, on a total surface area of  4 hectares.  The plant will be powered by the main city electric lines. The process creates very little liquid effluent. Sanitary wastewaters and runoff waters will be collected and discharged into a sceptic tank.  Minimum amount of process rising water will be treated. No hazardous waste will be generated. Solid waste will be regularly collected by the municipality and disposed off in the authorised municipal dump. The plant building will meet relevant EEC standards for air workplace quality and fire fighting.The tapped aquifer is located between 140 and 200m at depth and has proven reserves for over 500 years at  planned exploitation levels. Tapping of this aquifer will not affect local and regional water supplies. Great attention will be given during tubing and screening of the  borehole, in order to avoid any connection between the Akwaba aquifer and the 3 above aquifers. Regular hygiene and quality controls will be put in place in order to guarantee the purity and quality of the bottled water.Based on its review of available information regarding potential environmental impacts and proposed mitigation measures, IFC concludes that the proposed project is being designed to meet Government of Ivoiry Coast  requirements, and World Bank policies, and environmental, health and safety guidelines.IFC will monitor Drop Ivoire''s ongoing compliance with World Bank policies and guidelines during the life of the project by evaluating monitoring reports submitted annually to IFC by the sponsor and by conducting periodic site reviews during project supervision.The  is  from the Public Information Center.

The jurisdiction(s) of the project Company(ies) will be determined after selection of the Manager. Description of Company and Purpose of Project	SDC will provide finance and business advisory services with the objective of accelerating the use of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems -- which convert sunlight into electricity -- in off-grid applications in developing countries.  SDC will consist of two functional units -- a finance vehicle and a technical assistance entity which will provide business advisory services (BAS).  The  financing vehicle of SDC will seek to make debt, equity, and quasi-equity investments in a wide array of PV- related businesses, including local assemblers / systems integrators, distributors, retailers, energy service companies (ESCos), and financial intermediaries such as banks, leasing companies, NGOs, and other non-bank financial intermediaries (FIs).  The BAS entity will fund advisory services for potential investee companies well as fund more general PV awareness and capacity building services.     IFC is one of the founding investors in SDC and has played an integral role in the structuring and development of the SDC concept.  As SDC will act much like a privately managed fund investing in private-sector companies, it is appropriate that IFC is involved with IBRD in this initiative. In addition, IFC will play a particularly important role in identifying and securing the manager for SDC. IFC will also apply for and manage the use of any GEF funds that are incorporated in the capitalization of the finance vehicle.  In addition, IFC has, and will continue to, play a key role in the legal and financial structuring of SDC, so that it can accommodate a range of government, quasi-government, and private investors.       SDC is designed to have a substantial development impact.  It is an explicitly developmental entity which aims to accelerate the growth of viable, private-sector business activity in the distribution, sales and financing of off-grid PV applications in developing countries.  The objective is to increase the delivery of solar home systems (SHS) -- and thus bring environmentally clean electricity -- to rural households.  Many of these households will be replacing less efficient, environmentally inferior technologies, and many will gain access to electricity for the first time.  Environmental Category and Issues	This is a Financial Intermediary (FI) category project according to IFCs environmental review procedure. SDC will be required to undertake an environmental review of eligible borrower''s environmental performance and each sub-project''s compliance with the host country environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and standards as well as applicable World Bank policies and guidelines.  In addition, IFC will assess SDC''s capability to carry out environmental reviews.

He started a primary school in 1994 which has been very successful and is now planning an expansion into secondary education.Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment: &nbsp;Total project cost is estimated at US$0.21 million equivalent. &nbsp;IFC has been asked to provide a loan guarantee of US$0.1 million equivalent representing 50% of total project cost.Location of Project and Description of Site: The school complex is located in Ratoma, a commune of Conakry. &nbsp;Total size of the land on which the secondary school complex will be built is 1,235 square meters. &nbsp;Description of the Company and Purpose of the project: The project sponsor wants to create an integrated private school complex in Ratoma, the second largest commune of Conakry with an estimated population of 213,000 inhabitants, that would provide quality education to young guineans in secondary school attendance age. &nbsp;Mr. Abdoulaye Wann, opened a primary school called Hamdallaye primaire in October 1994 with 4 classrooms. &nbsp;Today, Hamdallaye primaire has 12 classrooms and a student body of 330 pupils. &nbsp;Thanks to its innovative approach which lead to : a) the introduction of computer training and English in the primary school; b) built in services such as transportation and lunch at school; and c) in house training programs for teachers, Hamdallaye has set new standards of excellence and has attracted pupils as far away as outside the Ratoma commune. The purpose of this project is therefore to support the establishment of a full fledged secondary school that would operate on the same basis of excellence.IFC Role: IFC is instrumental in moving the deal forward. &nbsp;The school has in the past benefited from a small loan from a UNDP financed program however this expansion is a larger size project. &nbsp;Local banks, although they considered the sponsor to be a serious individual, were lukewarm in going ahead and financing a school due to the lower returns in this sector.

Private Jordanian Investors are led by Mr. Samir Kawar, a successful and highly respected businessman, with significant agribusiness experience.  Other investors include the P.D.I. Company, which is owned jointly by I.C.C. of Jordan and the Koor Group of Israel, the Inter Arab Fund backed by OPIC, Jordan Investment Corporation and IFC.        Technical support is provided by Mashav - the Government of Israels Unit for International Cooperation. In the past year, Mashav helped finance the projects agricultural-professional consultancies.  Furthermore, Mashav financed the current planning phase (this document as well as soil tests and the physical planning).   Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The first phase of the project is budgeted to cost up to US$5 million, with IFC contributing up to US$1 million for a maximum of 20% of share capital. Location of project and Description of site	Situated in the FIFA region, 40Km from the Dead Sea on land that is owned by the Jordan Valley Authority (JVA), the proposed project forms part of an agreed land use plan for the area.  The site will initially occupy an area of approximately 35 hectares and if successful will be expanded to a total of around 200 ha.  Irrigation water for the site will be drawn from JVA boreholes and piped to the site.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Building on an IFC-finance feasibility study and a successful Pilot project, the Sponsors have decided to establish a Jordanian-Israeli joint venture company, Modern Agricultural Investment Company, ""MAICO"" or the ""Company"", to be engaged in post-harvest, extension and production activities in the Jordan Valley.  At full development, the Company would have its own ""anchor"" production sites which would operate as hubs for ""satellite farmers"", to be selected and associated to the Company through ""contract farming"".      The overall objective of the Company''s operations is to act as a market and technology beacon, working in complementarity with the Government of Jordan and IBRD''s actions, to help diversify and upgrade the range and combination of crops and irrigation methods, which would develop a modern export sector, thereby maximizing the economic return on irrigation water and ultimately rationalize its overall consumption.      The project has the following main developmental impacts: (i) foreign exchange generation; (ii) industry diversification; (iii) development of a brand name for Jordanian produce abroad; (iv) improvement of the farmers'' quality of life through income stability and enhancement; (v) creation of employment in the Company, the project area, and agricultural support services; (vi) modernization of farm system in Jordan through know-how transfer from Israel; (vii) enhancement of the prospects of regional integration; (viii) demonstration effect to other farms in Jordan and; (ix) economic spin-off to regional construction and irrigation companies.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.  Key environmental, social, occupational and safety issues that are of potential concern in this project include:  (i) the suitability of the land for agricultural activities;  (ii) increased use of agrochemicals; and (iii) worker health and safety issues.The soil quality and water supply issues associated with this project were addressed during the project design and the JVA has indicated that it is able to provide sustainable supplies of water for predicted demand.  The sponsor has indicated that measures will be taken to reduce water use through the application of high tech drip irrigation technologies and there will be no significant discharge of effluents.  Solid waste will either be re-cycled (plastic greenhouse materials) or composted/fed to livestock (organic waste). Agrochemical applications  will be minimized through the use of insect screens and nets in all greenhouses and the sponsor has indicated that none of the chemicals used will be on the World Bank''s list of banned substances.  Regular monitoring of chemical residues will be undertaken to ensure compliance with World Bank Group and European Union guidelines. The sponsor is preparing operating and training manuals for all workers and farmers who will join the scheme.  These manuals will address health and safety and environmental management principles and responsibility for compliance with operating procedures will be assigned to senior project staff.

It will consist of two parallel investment vehicles: one incorporated locally to accommodate domestic investors and another in the tax-efficient jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands for foreign investors.  Both vehicles will be managed by the same Manager and will be linked by an agreement to invest and divest together in proportion to their respective capitalizations.  SACGF II is a follow-on to SACGF, which had the same parallel structure, and was established in 1995 with IFC support and total commitments of US$144 million (IFCs commitment was US$20 million).  SACGF is performing exceptionally well, with 65% of its capital already invested and is generating healthy returns.  The local Manager has developed a strong pipeline of new deals, hence the rationale for a second roundPRIMARY SPONSORS:The Manager and Sponsor of the Fund will be Brait Capital Partners Limited, an investment management company operating through representative offices in South Africa and New York and majority owned by Capital Partners (who were the local sponsors and co-managers of SACGF) and Brait S.A., a newly created South African investment bank.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	US$350 million, including an IFC equity investment of up to US$35 million.Location of project and Description of site	South AfricaDescription of Company and Purpose of Project	The investment strategy for SACGF II will be the same as SACGF, namely to make later-stage private equity investments in growth companies, including management buyouts and expansions with the primary objective of achieving superior investment returns.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a Financial Intermediary (FI) project.  The Manager will be required to undertake an environmental review of eligible investee companys operations.  In addition, IFC will assess the Managers capability to carry out environmental reviews.

As PROPARCO would invest pari passu with IFC, the total project cost would be US$40 million equivalent.Location of project and Description of site	The line would be used in selected Sub-Saharan African countries where IFC has had so far limited presence.  PROPARCO would manage the line from its headquarters in Paris and from its field offices in the selected Sub-Saharan countries.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The line would be used to provide senior and venture loans, pari passu with PROPARCO, to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Sub-Saharan African countries where IFC has had so far limited presence.  By relying on AFD/PROPARCO groups extensive network in Sub-Saharan Africa, the project would enable IFC to extend its reach and complement its existing AEF and SEF programs.  The proceeds of the line would not be tied to any nationality requirements when it comes to the eligibility of companies or goods to be financed.  IFCs role would be mostly in the provision of long-term resources to a category of enterprises for which other sources of long-term financing are very limited.  The project will support the growth of the export oriented SME sector, which is central to the economy and the private sector of Sub-Saharan countries.  It will also contribute to institution building of African SMEs through the management support and the assistance in structuring the projects that the experienced AFD/PROPARCO field staff will provide to the African entrepreneurs.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category FI project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  PROPARCO has committed to establishing an environmental management system that will ensure that investments are consistent with applicable host country environmental laws and regulations as well as applicable World Bank environmental, health and safety guidelines and policies; designating appropriate individuals who will have responsibility for environment; attending IFCs environmental management workshops; submitting an environmental management plan; ensuring that all projects are cleared by IFCs Environment Division; and submitting an annual environmental performance report.

Al-Rowaishan is active in the imports of foodstuff, including wheat, wheat flour, sugar, and rice, while the Group has diversified operations in turnkey constructions, maritime transport, airfreight and charter operations, and oil field services. Established since 1979, Al-Rowaishan has a sound presence on the local market. In 1996, the sponsors wheat and flour imports were 14.4% and 11.2%, respectively, of total corresponding imports.Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment	The total project cost is estimated at approximately US$48 million. The Company has requested IFC financing of $12 million. Location of Project and Description of SiteThe proposal is to set up a flour mill and grain silos in the Al-Mualla zone area, at the port of Aden, the Republic of Yemen. The mill is designed with a wheat milling capacity of 600 tpd to reduce costs and increase product quality to meet local demand.  Silos with a maximum capacity of 45,000 tons of grain will complement the project and allow the company to receive shipments of up to 30,000 tons of wheat while holding fifteen days of raw material needs.  The project will be built on a 5.5 ha site leased for 21 years and located at Al-Mualla zone area of the port of Aden. This is a deep-water port that has been selected as one of the best sites for construction of such a facility to receive imported wheat and serve the local market. The Company will use one of six an existing jetty to handle shipments of up to 40,000 tons of wheat.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The project will be the first modern flour mill in Yemen. Because of its advanced design and technology, strategic location, and economies of scale, the company will benefit from significant savings on logistical and processing costs, and is expected to be the low-cost producer in Yemen and provide high quality flour and price competition. By importing modern milling technology and training Yemeni nationals in international quality management and operational skills, the project will demonstrate the benefits of a properly structured milling operation, thus promoting the development of the milling industry within the context of economic liberalization.The project would provide 145 direct skilled jobs, with additional employment benefits to be generated through the sale of bran and pollards by-products which in turn would stimulate the livestock industry.	IFC will assist Al-Rowaishan in developing a business plan, including a detailed analysis to establish the viability of the project and meet IFC standards. IFCs participation in the financing of the project will also help to raise additional financing from foreign banks, in an environment where local term financing is scarce, particularly for agricultural related activities.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure. The mill site is to be established within the industrial zone of the port of Aden and there are no issues connected with land clearing, relocation of people, or the establishment of industrial operations close to residential areas. Power for the mill will be provided by three 1.5MW diesel generators and air emissions from these sources will be within World Bank Group guidelines.  Bag filters will be used in the mill to control fugitive dust emissions to meet World Bank Group guidelines for ambient air in the workplace.  There are no process water effluents, and sanitary wastes are discharged to the port''s sewerage system. Machinery noise will be mitigated through design of equipment and installation of noise absorbing building materials.  Fire prevention measures will include emergency detection systems, fire fighting equipment and training.

ASG has ten resorts in Sri Lanka and two in the Maldives.  All the other activities of the Group are located in and around Colombo in Sri LankaDescription of Company and Purpose of Project(include IFCs Role and Development Impact)	Aitken Spence Group (ASG or the Group) is one of the larger diversified conglomerates in Sri Lanka.  The majority of the Group''s interests are in tourism (ten resorts in Sri Lanka and two in Maldives). The Group is also involved in cargo handling, printing and packaging materials, garment manufacture, property development, insurance and light engineering. On a consolidated basis for the year ended March 31, 1997, Aitken Spence had net sales of Rs.2.7 billion (US$45 million) and an operating profit of Rs.246.7 million (US$4 million).  Total assets for the same period stood at Rs.5 billion (US$83 million) and the net worth was Rs.2.5 billion (US$42 million).                                                                                                             ASG proposes to raise US$25 million by way of a  private equity placement (being arranged by Lehman Brothers) in order to reduce its leverage and put in place a planned expansion program involving increasing their presence in the profitable Maldivian tourism sector and entering the infrastructure (power) sector. The Group has requested an IFC participation of US$3-5 million in the private placement.	The proposed project allows IFC to play a long-term role in the development of a strong medium-sized enterprise towards global competitiveness.  The project would also be fully consistent with the Governments sectoral priorities where, (i) the diversification into tea and rubber plantations has been instrumental to the success and completion of the privatization program, and (ii) the proposed diversification into infrastructure (thermal power) can be expected to help reduce the gap between power demand and supply in Sri Lanka, in turn reducing the countrys over-reliance on hydro power. Overall, IFCs role in the proposed project is two-fold: (i) technical assistance, both in terms of structuring the transaction and in providing technical input to the Groups various product lines, and (ii) by being a long-term investor in the Group, to provide assistance on the Groups future strategic plans and guidance on important areas such as corporate governance.  The group has signed a mandate with IFC to this effect. IFC will play a major role in strengthening the prospects for a successful placement, and by virtue of linking its name to that of the Group, will add substantial value to the market perception of the Group. IFC will also add value to the Group through its technical expertise in the tourism and agribusiness areas.  In addition, although Lehman Brothers are the financial advisors to the transaction, there is likely to be an informal role for IFC in structuring the transaction. IFC will also help the Group in developing a cohesive long-term strategic plan, with a view to participating in future downstream projects in the infrastructure area. Environmental Category and Issues	Environmental issues : This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure. To ensure that environmental and occupational health and safety issues are addressed at the corporate level, IFC will require that the group have an appropriate management system in place to provide overall policy and direction for environment, health and safety (EH&S) matters and to ensure that the operating companies are responsible as well as accountable for their EH&S performance. As part of project appraisal, the Environmental Division will require  a review of the environmental and occupational health and safety performance of each of the groups existing operating companies. This investment will specifically include two 20 MW power plants and the following potential issues will be examined in each case : plant siting, air emissions and liquid effluents; solid waste handling and management; fuel storage and handling; fire protection and emergency response; and general worker health and safety.The  is  from the Public Information Center.Host country location of environmental documentsWorld Bank                                    Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC) Building, Ist Floor, 73/5 Galle Road, Colombo 3, Sri Lanka.Date SPI sent to PIC July 13, 1998This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

With a workforce of over 1,000, the Company is the only fully integrated broiler producer in Korea, currently processing 270,000 chickens a day. Halim has 23% of  Korea''s broiler market compared to 6% for its nearest competitor, and its brand is well recognized in Korea. The Company was founded by Mr. Hong-Kuk Kim, in 1978. Mr. Kim successfully opened up the Company in 1991 through a private issue. In July 1997, the Companys stock became publicly listed.  Mr. Kim and his immediate family retain 38% of the shares and full control of the Company.Project Cost including proposed IFC investmentIFC is considering a US$20 million investment in the form of equity and quasi equity.Location of project and Description of siteThe company is located in Iksam, in the Cholla Province, about 300Km. south of Seoul. All its farms and production plants are located within the North Cholla Province.Description of Company and Purpose of ProjectHalim has asked IFC to assist it in restructuring and strengthening its balance sheet by injecting US$20 million in equity/quasi-equity to refinance short term and medium term loans.  Due to the ongoing economic crisis and liquidity crunch, the Company has been obliged to rely on expensive short and medium term instruments to meet its working capital needs and refinance maturing loans. The Company is a success story in the Cholla region, an agricultural region traditionally deprived of investment funds by previous governments or foreign companies (the current President Mr. Kim Dae-Jung is from this area). Its network of more than six hundred loyal farmers (outgrowers) have benefited from Halims success deriving their primary or steady second income. The project is in line with IFCs strategy for Korea in that it will support the financial restructuring of a medium size enterprise, negatively affected by the on-going economic crisis. IFCs participation will also be crucial to entice other parties to inject additional equity to bring Halims debt to manageable levels.Environmental Category and IssuesThis is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.  The review of the project consisted of appraising technical and environmental information submitted by the project sponsor, and the technical appraisal and site review completed by IFCs Technical and Environment staff.  The following potential environmental, health and safety impacts of the project were analyzed: air emissions and wastewater effluents; solid waste management and disposal; handling and storage of hazardous materials; use of CFCs in refrigeration equipment; hygiene practices in all facilities; fire protection and emergency response; and general worker health and safety.

It is also involved in construction and telecommunications.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The total Project cost is US$288.5 million. IFC''s proposed investment is US$185 million, consisting of an A Loan of US$20 million, a B Loan of US$160 million and an equity participation of US$5 million. Location of project and Description of site	The Project is located in the Triunfo petrochemical complex (37 miles from Porto Alegre) in the Rio Grande do Sul state in Brazil. The Triunfo complex comprises the Copesul naphtha cracker at the core of the facility and seven second-generation producers, in addition to Innova. The site is well connected by road with the major market centers of the São Paulo/Rio de Janeiro and Montevideo/Buenos Aires areas.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Innova was set up in 1997 to build and operate a styrene/polystyrene production facility in the Triunfo complex. The Project consists of: the purchase and rehabilitation of an existing 190,000 tons ethylbenzene plant located in Triunfo; the construction of a new 180,000 tons styrene monomer unit and two new polystyrene plants with a total capacity of 120,000 tons of polystyrene; and the necessary offsites and utilities. Renewed stability and growth in Brazil and other economies in the region have created increased demand for polystyrene and other styrene derivatives. The region as a whole is a net importer of both products. The Project is expected to fill part of the Brazilian and regional shortfall in styrene and polystyrene production. Environmental Category and Issues	This is a Category B Project according to the IBRD''s environmental standards. Innova has efficient air pollution prevention equipment installed on the existing ethylbenzene plant and the new units will also comply with local requirements and IBRD guidelines. The spent catalyst from the ethylbenzene plant will be recycled for use by tanning industries in wastewater treatment. Innova''s wastewater will, after pre-treatment, be transferred to the central wastewater treatment facility (SITEL) within the Triunfo comlex. Innova will have a limited generation of solid wastes, which will be disposed of through the waste handling facilities established within Triunfo. The ethylbenzene unit was designed and certified according to both ISO 9000 and ISO 14000, and Innova will seek re-certification after start-up, with the same certification standard applied to the styrene and polystyrene units. There is some localized ethylbenzene contamination in the ethylbenzene plant site, which is being addressed by Innova under the supervision of FEPAM, the local environmental authority. The Innova project was part of the original petrochemical complex planning, which included public consultation.

Location of project and Description of site	City Lodge Limited (CLL) has its head office in Blantyre, the commercial capital of Malawi. The hotel will be constructed on a half-acre plot behind the Kandodo Cornershop on the Zalewa Road in the Blantyre central business district. Description of Company and Purpose of Project	City Lodge Limited (CLL) is a three story 30 bedroom hotel. The target market for the hotel is business people, both local and non-locals who travel to Blantyre on business. Presently the hotels available in Blantyre do not offer value for money. The services and amenities do not match the high prices charged. The rooms at CLL will offer direct telephone dialing, satellite TV and air conditioning. A restaurant, bar and conference hall will also be built to cater for guests and other visitors. The hotel will also have basement parking for its visitors and guests. 	IFCs finance will complete the financing plan and provide comfort to local financial institutions that are considering the project.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a Category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines, or design criteria. Environmental health and safety issues include site history and past contamination; disposal of liquid and solid wastes, including sewage; source of power and water supply including fuel storage if applicable; staff accommodation infrastructure; CFC-free cold storage and air conditioning; employee health and safety training; general housekeeping; and fire safety and emergency response preparedness.  IFC has reviewed the information provided by the sponsor as well as information provided in the appraisal report regarding environmental impacts and proposed mitigation measures. :  The site on which the project will be located is just outside Blantyre''s central business district.  The land is undeveloped and, according to the project sponsor and appraisal consultant, has been vacant historically, the sponsors will discharge their wastewater and sewage to the municipal sewerage system.   According to an engineer in the Blantyre Sewage Disposal Works, the municipal system has sufficient capacity to handle the hotels wastewater. The Government has adopted World Health Organization (WHO) limits for key water quality parameters (BOD, COD, pH and total suspended solids). City Lodge will obtain its power from the Electricity Supply Commission of Malawi (ESCOM). Because ESCOM''s supply is not reliable, a standby generator will be installed for use in the event of a power interruption and will be placed in a secondary containment structure capable of holding the entire contents of the tank in the event of a spill or breach. Water will be drawn from the Blantyre Water Board.  The hotel will utilize cold storage and air conditioning equipment that contains non-CFC refrigerants, in accordance with the provisions of the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that deplete the Ozone Layer. The sponsors will conduct an in-house training program for all staff that covers first aid, fire safety and safe operation of appliances and machinery.

San MiguelTechnical Partner and/or Major Shareholders	S.A. San Miguel (or San Miguel, the Company), is the leading lemon producer in Argentina and one of the largest in the world. The Companys operations are fully integrated: it grows lemon on some 5,400 ha of own plantations that supply approximately half of its lemon needs, and operates two packing plants and two processing plants in the Province of Tucuman. In 1997, San Miguels consolidated sales amounted to US$87 million. The Company sells fresh lemon fruits as well as industrialized lemon products such as lemon juice, lemon oil, and dehydrated lemon peel. More than 70% of the Companys revenues are derived from exports, essentially to Europe, the USA, Canada, the Far East, and the Middle East. The Net Worth of the Company as of end of  1997 was US$89.6 million while net income for the same year was US$10.5 million. Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The total investment is estimated at about US$28 million.  The IFC loan of US$12 million will finance around  43% of total investment, while 57% will come from the company''s own resources.  Location of project and Description of site	The project is located in Famailla,  about 30 km from San Miguel de Tucuman, where one of the Company''s processing plants and one of its packing plants are located.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	S.A. San Miguel is the leading company in the citrus sector in Argentina. Comprised mainly of family businesses, the industry has recently started a process of consolidation. The top-tier companies are upgrading their operations to better respond to the changes in the distribution system in the Western markets, which requires substantial investments. To consolidate its leadership position, S.A. San Miguel,  has already implemented a corporate restructuring in 1994 that has strengthened its financial base and marketing capabilities. The Company is currently implementing an expansion program aiming at doubling its processing capacity, diversifying risks in terms of plantation location, and maintaining the proportion of own fruit supply over the coming years, to address anticipated growth in demand.The proposed project consists of four main components: (i) the expansion of the fruit processing and packaging facilities; (ii) the investment in new orchards and new irrigation equipment; (iii) the rehabilitation and maintenance of the existing orchards; and, (iv) the purchase of agricultural equipment. IFC is interested in extending its reach to second tier companies aiming at international competitiveness, to sectors with a comparative advantage but for which long-term funding is not easy to obtain, and to less developed provinces. With the help of IFC, S.A. San Miguel will further improve its competitiveness in the world citrus sector, where Argentina has a strong comparative advantage. As an example of successful transition from a professional second tier company into a fully global company, this will have a strong demonstration effect in the province of Tucuman. The project will also generate direct benefits to the local economy through the creation of new jobs in a region facing a high level of unemployment and affected by the restructuring of its sugar industry, improved efficiencies in local lemon production and processing, expanded capacity to absorb increased lemon production when all the lemon trees will come into production, and the provision of alternative use for the land that has been so far cultivated with cane. Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  Environmental, occupational health, and safety issues that were analyzed included:  plantation site selection and associated social impacts; environmental, health and safety performance of the existing and expanded packaging and processing plants; wastewater treatment plant(s) capacity and sludge disposal; solid waste management and disposal; use and handling of pesticides/hazardous materials in the plantations; and general employee health and safety, including training. Based on its review of available information regarding potential environmental impacts and proposed mitigation measures, IFC concludes that S.A. San Miguel''s proposed project is designed to meet World Bank Group environmental, health and safety policies and guidelines as well as host country requirements.The  is  from the InfoShop.Date SPI sent to InfoShop September 4, 1998This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Total Project cost is estimated at US$79 million. IFC''s investment would consist of an A-Loan of US$25 million and an equity investment of up to US$5 million equivalent in BPC''s capital.Location of project and Description of site	Bitechs operational base is in Pechora, in the Komi Republic of Russia. Pechora has a relatively well-developed oil infrastructure and a variety of small, as yet undeveloped, oil fields.       Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Bitech is a Russian joint stock company, which was established in 1994. It has licenses pertaining to three main oil fields, namely South Kyrtayel, Lekker and Subor, with combined proven reserves of about 45 million barrels. Bitech started producing from South Kyrtayel in 1995 and posted its first net income in the third quarter of 1997.       The Project involves the full development of the South Kyrtayel and Lekker fields and includes drilling and gas re-injection facilities. It also includes an extended well test and seismic studies on Subor, which is adjacent to the Lekker field and is a non-producing heavy oil field. The Project is expected to result in a peak production of about 18,500 barrels per day and recovery of up to 45 million barrels of crude oil. Implementation is well underway and is expected to take three years.      IFC''s main role is to complete the financing plan by providing long term funding, which is not readily available for relatively small and independent Russian companies. IFCs presence and financing will also help to mitigate the perceived political risk of investing in Russia for BPC, and encourage it to expand and strengthen its Russian operations as well as support its plans to establish joint ventures with other Russian and foreign oil companies.  In this way, IFC will be supporting private sector led hydrocarbons development in Russia. Finally, IFC will ensure that the project meets the World Bank environmental guidelines.The project is expected to have a strong developmental impact by supporting Russias oil sector, which is a key sector for the country and which continues to suffer from severe under-investment. The lack of investment in Komi has created significant economic hardship in its oil producing communities. The project will generate additional tax revenues for the central and local governments, and benefit Russias balance of payments.  Bitechs control of field operations combined with its policy of employing only Russian staff, will help transfer western oil production technology to Russia. Finally, the project would have a positive demonstration impact for foreign oil companies, willing to invest in Russia, but wary of its very uncertain investment climate. Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure. The full development of the South Kyrtayel and  first phase of  Lekker field will be accomplished using existing well pads, field roads and pipelines.  At the Subor field the project includes seismic and a test well.  The project includes the remediation of existing contamination at the two well pads at South Kyrtayel.  Produced gas currently being flared will be reinjected to support an enhanced oil recovery program.  The project includes an emergency response plan including an oil spill contingency plan.  The project responds to requests for humanitarian causes and is committed to helping its neighbouring communities.  While gulag labor has been used in the past at the request of the camp commander for useful work for prisoners, the sponsor has decided not to do so in the future.  At IFC''s request, the sponsor will give a written undertaking to that effect and commit to referring to IFC for approval if it wishes to respond positively to any similar future request.  The project has all the required environmental permits granted on the basis of separate Environmental Impact Assessment Reports prepared in accordance with Komi Republic requirements.  The project fully complies with applicable World Bank safeguard policies and environmental, health and safety guidelinesThe  is  from the Infoshop.Date SPI sent to PIC September 14, 1998This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

MediaOne consists of US Wests cable television and international wireless communications operations, is known to IFC through US Wests sponsorship of Westel 450 (Hungary, IFC/R92-39), Westel 900 (Hungary, IFC/M94-14), and RTDC (Russia, IFC/R94-159).  Bell Atlantic is a regional Bell operating company, with more than 41 million wireline customers and 6.7 million wireless customers in 23 countries.  The other shareholder (with a 51% economic interest and a 60% voting interest) is Slovak Telecom, the state-owned national fixed-line operator.  It has about 1.5 million telephone lines in service.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Total project cost is estimated to be about US$250 million, and IFC''s proposed investment would be up to US$30 million, which would likely consist of:  up to US$10 million in an IFC ""A"" Loan, and up to US$20 million in an income participating IFC ""C"" Loan.  Other financing is expected to come primarily from a syndicate of commercial banks whose loans will be backed by ECAs and/or MIGA.Location of project and Description of site	The project is to help finance EuroTels continued build-out of its nation-wide mobile cellular telecommunications networks and improve the Companys capital structure.  EuroTel owns and operates an analog NMT mobile network that covers approximately 94% of the population and 76% of the geography of the Slovak Republic, and a digital GSM network that covers approximately 93% of the population and 68% of the geography.  Future build-out would likely focus on increasing network capacity, improving indoor coverage, and improving network quality.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	EuroTel is one of two national mobile cellular operators in the Slovak Republic.  In 1990, EuroTel was awarded a 20-year license to operate a national analog mobile cellular network. In 1996, it was also granted a 15-year national digital GSM license.  In February 1997, the Company began offering GSM services along with its existing analog services, and as of August 1998, EuroTel had over 150,000 wireless subscribers, which accounts for a large share of the mobile cellular market.	The Slovak Republic is one of the Extending IFCs Reach countries, and the project would demonstrate to the government and to potential foreign investors that IFC supports private sector participation in the infrastructure development of the country. In addition, IFC would not only provide scarce long-term financing, but would also act as a source of comfort to other lenders, which will be more likely to invest knowing IFC is present.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.  Environmental issues associated with this project include:  right-of-way alignment, land acquisition, development of sensitive land, tower site selection, impacts and monitoring of ongoing operations, PCBs, solid and liquid waste.  Occupational health and safety issues include: fire safety, emergency response, and general employee safety and training.To help mitigate these potential environmental and social impacts, EuroTel will comply with applicable IFC and Slovakian environmental and social laws, regulations and guidelines, and IFC will monitor compliance by evaluating reports submitted annually by the Company, and by conducting on-site reviews during project supervision as needed.  The Company will locate new base stations on existing telecommunications sites wherever feasible, and EuroTel will select and construct new sites in accordance with applicable regulations.

"La Universal, S.A.",Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Ecuador,La Universal S.A.,"Gbl Ind, Manufact, Agribus & Services",1998-10-30T05:00:00Z,"",B,Loan,"Summary Of Project Information (SPI)Project NameEcuador-La Universal, S.A.RegionLatin America & CaribbeanSectorProject No009132Projected Board DateNovember 30, 1998Company NameLa Universal, S.A.Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders	Until 1992, La Universal was owned by members of the Norero, Segale, Toscanine and Costa families.  In that year, Nabisco made an offer to acquire majority ownership of La Universal and members of all owning families decided to sell their shares.  Mr. Domingo Norero who then owned 14% of La Universal, objected.  Via a leveraged buyout in November 1992, Norero purchased shares of the owning families mentioned above and acquired majority control of La Universal to prevent its sale to Nabisco.  Today, the Company is wholly owned by Domingo Norero. Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The total project cost is US$36 million, of which 50% relates to a refinancing of short-term, residual debt from Norero''s LBO and 50% relates to new fixed asset investments.  IFC''s own investment will amount to US$13.2 million, including an US$8.2 million A Loan and an equity investment of up to US$5 million.  Location of project and Description of site	La Universal is located in Guayaquil, Ecuador.  It''s existing plant was constructed in 1927.  The factory is vertically oriented, comprised of three floors with total area of 17,684 m2 built around a central atrium.  Description of Company and Purpose of Project	La Universal, S.A. was founded in 1889 in Guayaquil by Emilio and Juan Bautista Segale who acquired a small factory and began producing cookies and chocolate bars.  Today, La Universal ranks as one of Ecuadors leading confectionery and food companies.  Its products are chocolate and consumer cocoas; hard and soft candy; pasta, cookies, crackers; and semi-finished goods for industrial use including cocoa powder, butter and liquor.       The Project involves: (i) upgrading the existing plant, including select investments to eliminate bottlenecks; (ii) the re-engineering of the Companys production layout to increase capacity and improve efficiencies; (iii) construction of a new warehouse and distribution facility; and (iv) the refinancing of existing short-term debt. IFC RoleThe proposed financing for La Universal would represent IFCs first investment in an industrial manufacturing company in Ecuador since the 1970s.  IFCs support of La Universal would help a viable  Ecuadorian company continue its pattern of growth within the Andean region and through exports beyond. This support would be fully consistent with the objectives of IFCs country strategy for Ecuador which call for investments in  companies with good growth potential and where IFCs investment will encourage further development and improved governance in the gravely underdeveloped manufacturing sector.   IFCs role as  catalyst is central in this transaction.  The proposed IFC investment would provide La Universal with much needed capital and long-term  financing to imrpove the maturity profile and average cost of its debt. Long-term finance is unavailable in Ecuador. Indeed, the Company currently faces real local interest rates of 15-20% in US Dollars with tenors limited to a maximum of 2 years with quarterly amortization of principal and no grace on most credits.  The Commonwealth Development Corporation of the UK has indicated its interest in making a parallel equity investment of up to  US$10 million provided that IFC itself makes an investment in La Universal.      Development ImpactEcuadors history of volatility has made for a difficult operating environment for its private sector companies.  Nonetheless, La Universal has a long tradition within the Ecuadorian food industry and has developed impressive market shares for its products. IFCs support of La Universal would provide assistance during a critical period of transition and help a viable Ecuadorian company continue its pattern of growth domestically and through exports abroad. The Ecuadorian economy is dominated by traditional export products such as oil, bananas, shrimp and sugar. In dialogues with IFC and other multilaterals, Government authorities have specifically called for supporting the development of its non-traditional sectors and value-added industries.  La Universal is one of relatively few private sector industrial companies which fit this profile. In addition, La Universal sources nearly 100% of its cocoa, milk, flour and sugar needs locally. It provides value-added processing to Ecuadors raw materials and serves as an example of how to market and export products outside Ecuador. The Government of Ecuador is encouraging further development of Ecuadors cocoa industry as an export item.  La Universal itself processes 10-15% of the Ecuadorian cocoa crop, and its Management has played an active role in the policy dialogue concerning this sector.  Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure.  Key environmental, social and health and safety issues associated with this project include:  current and past land use, social impacts from workforce reductions, liquid effluents, solid waste disposal, air emissions, power and water supply, use of appropriate refrigerants, hygiene and housekeeping, workers safety and training, emergency response and fire protection.  La Universal''s existing factory is located in the south section of the City of Guayaquil and is surrounded by the Guayas River.  The proposed expansion will be developed in an existing three level building with an area of 5000 square meters.  La Universal''s management discharged all union employees and paid all required separation and other wages due, for a total cost of US$7.4 million.  Liquid waste generated during the cleaning of the manufacturing areas and sanitary uses will be discharged to the municipal sewer system for its treatment.  La Universal''s Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) parameter is not in compliance with World Bank guidelines.  La Universal has agreed to prepare a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) to address this issue, which will be resolved by December 31, 1999.  Air emissions from the cocoa roasting area will be recirculated and discharged through a dust collection system.  Personal protective equipment such as dust masks will be provided to employees in areas susceptible to air borne non-toxic food dust.  Potable water is brought in tanks to the company on a daily basis.  The company has planned the installation of a 400 cubic meter per day water treatment plant to filter water from the adjoining river.  La Universal will develop an emergency and preparedness program for its facility.The  is  from the InfoShop.Date SPI sent to InfoShop October 30, 1998This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

The Holding Grupo Mas X Menos is 95% owned by the Uribe family and 5% by Mr. Samuel Hidalgo. Mr. Rodrigo Uribe is the President of the Holding Grupo Mas X Menos and the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Superunidos. The Company plans to become public by listing new shares in Costa Ricas or New Yorks stock exchanges.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The total project cost is estimated at about US$125 million.  IFCs proposed investment is expected to be in the form of up to US$30 million in an A Loan and an equity investment of up to US$10 million.Location of project and Description of site	The project will be located throughout the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, covering the main cities, the interior and the more rural areas of the four countries.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Corporación Supermercados Unidos, S.A. (Superunidos or the Company), is the largest supermarket chain in Costa Rica with 86 stores located in San José and in the interior of the country. Superunidos''three-year Project will involve the following components: (a) opening 38 stores in Nicaragua, 50 stores in the Dominican Republic, 48 stores in Honduras and 50 stores in El Salvador; (b) installing point of sale technology with product coding in each store and upgrading management information systems; and (c) training the new personnel to Superunidos service standards, with an estimated total cost of US$125 million. The Company expects to benefit from higher margins (as a result of lower fixed costs, improved efficiencies and economies of scale), to streamline and run more technologically-efficient operations, and improve its competitive position, while at the same time preempting local and foreign competitors wishing to enter the proposed markets.  IFCs financing provides Superunidos with long-term funding which would otherwise be limited and expensive through other sources for companies in Central America.  In addition, IFC could serve as a catalyst to encourage greater foreign investment in the Company.  IFCs participation would also improve the Companys corporate governance through improved reporting and better management practices, while acting as an agent of change in its expansion plans.  Superunidos'' Project is expected to have the following developmental impacts: (i) the Companys expansion plans would assist in distributing to the less able population groups a wider variety of food and other basic necessity items (at lower or competitive prices) under cleaner and more hygienic conditions.  By delivering products in the interior at the same price as in the capital cities, the Project would foster a more competitive environment, while reducing traveling time and distances for the more remote communities. The Project would also improve the distribution of food and non-food items in the four countries, by introducing best practice and modern retailing methods, and by bringing about technological improvements in logistics and distribution systems; and (ii) the Project will create about 2,700 jobs, primarily for women, contributing to social and economic growth in the more rural areas of the two countries. In addition, the Project would also provide uncommon employee-benefit packages and higher than average compensation rates.  The expansion plans would also foster better academical standards and training, and create career opportunities for the Companys employees and management, thereby improving the standards of living in the region in which it will operate. Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure.  Environmental, social, health and safety issues associated with the project include:  site selection and site environmental and social conditions, liquid and solid waste treatment, use of appropriate refrigerants, fire protection, emergency response, and general worker health and safety.  CSU stores will be located in commercial areas, and in middle and low income neighbourhoods.  CSU is committed to undertake and provide IFC with details of future land acquisitions and to comply with World Bank policies and guidelines.  Liquid effluents will be treated at municipal wastewater treatment plants, in those countries were municipal services are not available, CSU will design, construct and operate a wastewater treatment plant.  Domestic solid waste will be collected by local authorities for final disposal.  CSU has developed a fire and earthquake emergency plan, and will provide employees with appropriate training.  IFC concludes that, the proposed project is being designed to meet Governments of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and the Dominican Republic requirements, and World Bank policies, and environmental health and safety guidelines.

The Group has been active in the Baltics since 1994 and became one of the most active investors in the region. Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The total project cost is estimated at US$27.7 million with IFC''s investment of up to US$10 million, including an IFC senior loan of up to US$5 million and a C loan of up to US$5 million.Location of project and Description of site	The project is located in Kehra, Estonia, 40 km east of Tallinn at the facilities of the old pulp and paper mill. Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The project includes the second phase of IFC investment in rehabilitation and modernization of Horizon Pulp and Paper, the only producer of an unbleached pulp and paper in Estonia. The initial IFC investment of US$6 million, approved in 1996 was used to fund rehabilitation of assets acquired by the Tolaram Group from a bankrupt Kehra paper mill through a privatization process and investments in a new tissue converting facility. The second phase of investment includes: 1) further improvements of the old kraft paper mill aimed at increasing capacity and efficiency, improving cost competitiveness and environmental standards and ensuring the continued and safe operation of the plant; and 2) strengthening of the existing tissue converting facility by installation of a synchro line for tissue production. IFC has taken a very active role in developing the project concept and the investment strategy of Horizon. IFC''s involvement will also help the Company to obtain better access to financing sources, by providing comfort for other banks and financial investors. The Project will have a strong positive developmental impact. It will promote the development of a higher value added, export oriented industry based on the local raw material, which makes a significant contribution towards sustainable development of Estonian economy. The Company utilizes the most significant natural resource of Estonia -timber. Because of the high capital intensity, future development of the Estonian paper and related industries is unlikely without injection of outside capital and transfer of know-how. The project will also contribute to the regional development of Estonia, where employment is heavily concentrated in the capital and the unemployment rate is high in small towns and in the countryside. The Company re-hired close to 500 former employees of bankrupt Kehra Paper mill and continues to be the main employer in the area. In addition to securing the existing employment, the new project will increase direct and indirect employment in Kehra by up to 100 employees. The project will also have a significant positive environmental impact by further improving environmental standards of the existing kraft mill and ensuring that it continues to meet World Bank policies and guidelines and national environmental standards.  Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure. Key environmental, occupational health and safety issues which were reviewed for this project include: forest management and harvesting practices and their sustainability, air, water and solid waste emissions and management, handling of hazardous materials, fire protection and emergency response and general worker health and safety. IFC''s Environmental Division visited Horizon and reviewed environmental information submitted by the Company. Estonia has developed a comprehensive framework for sustainable management and use of its forests resulting in a growing forest area and increasing wood production available for industrial use. The Company has made good progress in controlling air emissions. The planned upgrading of the recovery boiler and fiber line will further reduce the air emissions and ensure continuing compliance with the World Bank and Estonian environmental standards.  Wastewater is treated in an activated sludge treatment plant, producing effluent which is well within Bank Group guidelines. Solid wastes are landfilled in a municipal facility near the plant. Installation of the lime kiln will eliminate the current practice of landfilling of lime-sludge, and the bark boiler investment will allow burning of the bark to produce energy and reduce the load on the landfill considerably. Fire protection facilities in some parts of the old plant need significant improvement, and the Sponsor will undertake a review of fire protection needs and develop a plan for installation of needed equipment to meet the World Bank and national fire safety standards. Occupational health and safety conditions are generally good and appropriate training programs are in place.

Lanco International, Inc. is the parent company of Mi-Jack Products, Inc. (Mi-Jack), the largest independent intermodal terminal operator in North America. The Kansas City Southern railroad system comprises about 6000 miles of rail line. Mi-Jack handles approximately 4 million intermodal moves per year at over 50 locations.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Project cost is estimated at US$75 million for the 2-year period 1998-2000.  IFC''s proposed investment in PCRC consist of an equity/quasi-equity investment of up to US$6 million, an IFC loan of up to US$12 million, and up to US$35 million in loans from participants. Location of project and Description of site	The PCRC network is located between the city of Colon on the Atlantic Ocean and Panama City on the Pacific side.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The project initially consists of completely renovating the entire 47-mile rail network; the construction of intermodal terminals next to the ports on both coasts and the purchase or lease of rolling stock and terminal equipment. PCRC will receive containers from the port operators on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, load at the near-dock railroad intermodal terminal, transport via rail service across the isthmus to the other near dock terminal, unload and connect with a vessel. For domestic delivery, and delivery to the Colón Free Trade zone, containers will be loaded onto trucks at both intermodal terminals for delivery to the final destination. The proposed investment is expected to be carried out over a 2-year period beginning in 1998. The initial annual volume is estimated at 75,000 containers, increasing to an estimated 177,900 containers annually by 2005. Although not part of this project, PCRC envisages the provision of a passenger service on its track by a third party that would furnish and maintain the equipment for the passenger service.Environmental Category and IssuesThis is an environmental and social review category B project.  Key issues reviewed included PCRCs implementation of an environmental management program for system renovation and operation; displacement of small businesses, residents and transients for railroad facilities; labor issues; protection of natural areas and cultural property; liability for site contamination from past railway operations and on newly-acquired properties; public safety and emergency response programs; employee training and health and safety programs; and public consultation and disclosure.An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the initial phase of construction and operation of the railroad was prepared (in both Spanish and English) in May 1998.  PCRC has prepared and will implement a Resettlement Plan in accordance with IFC policies.  Staff employed by the former railroad operator were terminated in accordance with a government-approved retrenchment package that had been developed for other privatizations in Panama.  PCRC has since rehired selected personnel for its current operations, and will rehire others with preference to qualified former employees and Panamanian citizens.  As required by the concession PCRC and ARI, the Canal Zone redevelopment authority, will establish a plan for completing any required site remediation at the governments cost. PCRC and its consultants have conducted extensive consultation with government agencies and other interested groups during both the concession process and preparation of the EIA.  The Resettlement Plan, together with an Environmental Review Summary prepared by IFC, are being publicly disclosed at the World Banks InfoShop and in-country.

IFC''s proposed investment consists of a loan of US$19 million, and FMO will provide a parallel loan of US$10 million.  Location of project and Description of site	SICC is located in Jiangxian County, 280 kilometers south of Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi Province in interior north China.  CMMI''s foundry workshop, which CMMI contributed as its equity investment in SICC, is the Project''s operational site.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The Project is to expand and modernize SICC''s capacity to reach installed capacity of approximately 68,000 tons/year and to produce approximately 40,500 tons/year of ferrous iron castings p.a. for engine heads, blocks and other castings for the automotive and heavy equipment industries.  The Project will contribute to the modernization of the Chinese foundry sector which is currently characterized by small, low-quality operations.  The Project aims to supply the increasing demand of castings by providing high quality products for both the domestic and export markets.  SICC is the largest foreign investment company so far in the interior province of Shanxi, one of the poorest regions in China.  This Project will represent IFCs first investment in Shanxi province, demonstrating IFCs expanded commitment to its strategy of concentrating on the development of China''s interior provinces. The Project is also consistent with IFCs goal to catalyze investments from foreign investors who will transfer world-class technological and management know-how. In addition, the proposed project is essentially a restructuring of the local partner, CMMI, by creating a JV to utilize CMMI''s valuable existing assets more efficiently. Ideally, this Project will serve as a model for other SOEs in the region to follow when developing future restructuring plans.  This project, therefore, falls into Chinas top development priority which is SOE reform. Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure.  Environmental, occupational health and safety issues which were examined during the review of this project included: site contamination from previous activities; air emissions; wastewater handling and treatment; solid and hazardous waste handling; fire safety and emergency response; social and community issues; and general worker health and safety.  Minor site contamination from previous activities is not affecting groundwater and requires no remediation.

Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders	The major shareholder with a 82% interest is Gumussuyu Hali Group with a share capital of about US$15 million.  The remaining 18% is publicly held and listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange.  The Hali Group was founded in 1952 as a small semi-worsted yarn-spinning mill, which expanded into woven area carpet production in the sixties, and into tufted broadloom carpets in 1991.  The Group is majority-owned by the Oztemir family, which has a long tradition in carpet manufacturing.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The total project cost is estimated at US$31 million, of which IFC''s proposed investment is US$12 million including an A Loan of US$9 million and a senior convertible loan of US$3 million.  Location of project and Description of siteThe project Company is located on a 10.5 hectare site near the Cerkezkoy township, about 100 km northwest of Istanbul, Turkey.  Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The Company was established in July 1996 as a spin-off from the Hali Group through the transfer of all carpet production facilities and related real estate.  Following the spin-off, the Company became the only producer of both woven area carpets and broadloom carpets in Turkey.  The Project will introduce higher value-added products, improve yarn quality, and achieve economies of scale thus enabling the Company to become more competitive following Turkey''s entry into a customs union with the European Union in 1996.  The proposed project involves investment in technology improvement and production monitoring, which are expected to reduce the Company''s average unit costs thus enabling it to effectively compete in the domestic market against imports as well as maintain product quality.  The Project has a strong developmental impact as it aims to improve the Company''s competitiveness on the domestic market.  Considered in the context of the Turkish broadloom carpet sector, which is expected to grow steadily and significantly over the next five years, the proposed Project is likely to set the tone of the industrys response to increased competition.  IFC will provide the Company with long-term financing, which is scarce in Turkey and which will improve the Company''s debt profile.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review.  The following potential environmental, health and safety impacts of the project were analyzed:  air emissions from manufacturing processes and power generation; dyeing and sewage effluent treatment and disposal; solid and liquid waste disposal; fire prevention and emergency response; and occupational health & safety.  There is no evidence of sensitive areas near the Company site.  The Company has reported to have no problem with contaminated land from present or past operations.  The emissions are stated to be within national and local emission limits and the levels quoted are within World Bank guideline levels. The industrial wastewater and sewage (approx. 275 m3/day) from the Gumussuyu factory is piped 4 kilometers in an underground pipeline to a municipal treatment facility.  Gumussuyu has provided data on the water discharge quality from the treatment plant which confirms that it meets appropriate World Bank effluent standards.  Gumussuyu have plans to construct an effluent pre-treatment plant in each of the existing and new factories to reduce the pollution load on the central treatment plant. The costs of these plants are included in the project investment plan.Health and Safety issues identified by the company are noise, chemical handling and storage and general fire safety.  Personal protective equipment is issued (safety shoes, gloves, overalls, safety glasses etc) and safety training is given to approximately 700 persons annually.

Description of Company and Purpose of Project	UPPC is the largest producer of extensible sack paper, corrugating medium and testliner in the Philippines.  The Company commissioned a second paper machine in November 1998 and quadrupled its production capacity.  The Company used short-term bridge loans to complete its expansion.  However, as a result of the regional economic crisis the Company is unable to replace its bridge loans with long-term financing. In addition, the Company is also over-leveraged.IFC proposes to financially restructure UPPC by increasing its equity base and refinancing existing short-term debt.  IFC would assist the Company in approaching its existing lenders to convert their short-term loans into long-term loans.  The proposed transaction would also help finance the Companys outstanding contract payables and help meet its working capital requirements.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure.  Key issues which were examined during the environmental and social review included: liquid effluent handling and treatment; air emissions; solid waste disposal; handling of hazardous materials; fire protection and emergency response; and general worker health and safety.Process wastewater from the paper machines is handled in a new, state-of-the-art activated sludge wastewater treatment plant with ample capacity for the new mill.  The mill is also equipped with systems for fiber recovery and water recycling.   All liquid effluents from the site will meet World Bank Group guidelines and Philippine government requirements.  UPPC has just completed construction of a new 30 MW cogeneration power plant, with boilers fitted with state-of-the-art combustion controls; measured stack emissions meet World Bank Group guidelines.  Solid wastes are largely rejects from waste paper cleaning, and these are landfilled on the site.Appropriate fire prevention measures are incorporated throughout the mill.

The Company is vertically integrated from genetics to the production of value added processed shrimp. GGM is a joint venture between U.S. and Honduran investors employing about 1500 staff in the Department of Choluteca, 200km south of Tegucigalpa. The Groups flagship company Granjas Marinas San Bernardo (GMSB) was founded in 1983 when the Honduran Government granted a 5,775-hectare concession in Choluteca. The Group manages about 2,500 ha of grow-out ponds, a hatchery, a deheading plant, and a processing plant in the town of San Lorenzo, 30km north of Choluteca.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	IFC is considering a US$9 million investment in the form of an A loan.Location of project and Description of site	GGM expansion sites and processing facilities are in the Department of Choluteca about 200KM south of Tegucigalpa.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The project aims to assist GGM, the largest shrimp producer in Honduras, to restructure its working capital and initiate an expansion of its hatchery, farming and processing sites. GGM infrastructure was spared of major damage from Hurricane Mitch with some repairs needed to rehabilitate access roads, water intake/outflow structures, and grow-out ponds; however, heavy losses were realized in the form of goods in process loss (shrimp), as the Group''s grow-out ponds were fully stocked and ready to be harvested when Mitch hit.  GGM estimates losses at around 3.5 million lbs. of shrimp or 40% of its annual production or about US$8 million in foregone sales.  This has resulted in the deterioration of the Group''s working capital structure. Right before Mitch struck, GGM was in the process of launching a major expansion program to increase production, reduce raw material costs, increase processing efficiencies, and move further into production of value added shrimp based foods. The US$14 million expansion plan included: i) adding 800 new production hectares in Playon Palacios, an area adjoining the Group''s largest farm in San Bernardo, Choluteca; ii) expanding the Group''s local shrimp post larva hatchery (PL); and iii) modernizing its freezing equipment to reduce dehydration losses in the packing plant. Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.  Key environmental, social and occupational health and safety issues that were of potential concern in the project include:  habitat loss, use of agrochemicals, water use and wastewater management, air emissions, Solid waste management and disposal, Environmental management capacity, occupational health and safety, land acquisition process, and potential indirect socio-economic impacts on artisanal shrimp farmers.The project involves the rehabilitation and expansion of production sites and packaging plant including an additional 950ha of shrimp ponds.  New ponds will be constructed on unvegetated salt flats that support no significant fauna. No physical resettlement of people has occurred and there is no human activity on the proposed expansion site and no economic displacement will occur as a result of development.Use of agrochemicals conforms with World Bank Group requirements.  Waste water effluents and air emissions are within World Bank Group guideline requirements for existing sites and facilities.  New pond areas and facilities will also conform to these requirements.  Solid waste is minimized and disposed of in an appropriate manner. The company recognizes the benefits of environmental management and is developing an appropriate corporate environmental management system.

Important impediments to the development of the Macedonian SME sector are lack of access to equity capital, limited availability of long-term lending, and business managers insufficient business expertise and technical training. SEAF-Macedonia aims to alleviate these constraints by providing equity capital supplemented by appropriate technical assistance. The Fund will assist in the development of the private sector in Macedonia by supporting viable SME equity investments.  Local commercial banks would be encouraged to lend to some of the investee companies since the Fund will provide the necessary capital base.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a Financial Intermediary (FI) Type 2 project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure.  The Fund will be required to undertake an environmental review of each subproject to ensure compliance with host country requirements, IFC environmental and social safeguard policies, and, if applicable, World Bank Group environmental, health and safety guidelines.

Out of the five new hotels, three will be managed under Fiesta Ameicana: Fiesta Americana Cabo del Sol located in the Baja Peninsula, the Explorean Costa Maya and the Explorean Kohunlich, both located in the Quintana Roo State.  The other two hotels will be operated under Fiesta Inn: Fiesta Inn Ciudad Juarez located in a US border city, and Fiesta Inn Puebla la Noria, situated in Mexico'' mid center.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Posadas is the largest hotel operator in Mexico with respect to number of hotels, rooms and geographic coverage.  The Company operated a total of 51 hotels representing 11,098 rooms at 31 destinations in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and the US, serving a broad base of vacation and business travelers.  	The new hotel investment will enhance Posadas leadership by (i) increasing the number of its foreign currency earning coastal properties, (ii) expanding its presence in the underserved mid-sized urban city market, and (iii) allowing the Company to enter into a new market niche, the soft eco-tourism hotel concept developed in-house.  The debt retailoring, on the other hand, will replace the Companys bridge financing incurred for its acquisition of the Caesar Park chain in South America in 1998, reduce its financial costs, and improve its balance sheet.  In addition, once the Companys financial position is improved, Posadas will be able to proceed with its expansion in Brazil.Posadas, like many other small and medium size enterprises, is currently being affected by the dramatic contraction in the domestic and foreign credit resulting from the emerging market financial crisis. IFC''s involvement in the Project will have a wide demonstration effect within the international banking community by expressing renewed confidence in Mexico''s economic prospects and encouraging resumption of long-term lending to its small and medium size enterprises. Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.  Environmental and social issues associated with this project include: sewage and liquid effluents, solid waste, water and power supply, and CFCs.  Health and safety issues include fire protection, emergency response, employee training and public and employee health and life safety.	Posadas is establishing a corporate Risk Management Department to consolidate and comprehensively manage fire prevention and life safety (FP/LS), environmental, health and safety (EH&S), and social development matters.  EH&S aspects of Posadas properties have been found to be generally in compliance with governmental and World Bank guidelines.  Posadas five new hotels, based on available information, are designed and equipped to meet applicable FP/LS and environmental requirements.  IFC and Posadas have engaged a fire safety consultant who is conducting field appraisals of all of Posadas owned/leased/managed properties and developing a Corrective Action Plan for compliance with current World Bank/IFC fire safety guidelines.The  is  from the InfoShop.Host country location of environmental documentsOn Posadas'' website (www.posadas.com.mx) and on local newspaperDate SPI sent to InfoShop:March 30, 1999This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

SEAF is a US not-for-profit, tax-exempt organization, is a shareholder and manager of nine for-profit SME venture capital, small business investment funds operating locally on a commercially sustainable basis. Each of SEAFs country funds is staffed primarily by local professionals trained in business, law and/or finance, working under the direction of an experienced expatriate financial executive.  SEAF employs 10 full-time staff in its Washington, DC headquarters, with more than 90 local staff in the Country Funds.  SEAF country funds have made over 120 investments for a total of about US$35 million.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The project consist of developing a fund -- the Small Enterprise Assistance Fund (SEAF), Central and Eastern Europe Growth Fund (the ""Fund"").  SEAF is seeking to raise between US$20 million and US$40 million for the CEE to make second round investments, mainly in existing Country Fund clients who are beyond the incubation stage, have established a viable track record and are ready to expand their operations.  IFC will make an equity investment of the lesser of US$5 million or 20% of the total capitalization of the Fund.  The individual investments will range from $1 million to $3 million, with a minimum, investment of $500,000 and a maximum investment of $ 5 million, a level higher than the range for SEAFs existing Country Funds (from $50,000 to $400,000).

Description of Company and Purpose of Project	SEAF has operated successfully at the country level.  The proposed project is an attempt to build on this success and to attract commercial capital for second round investments.  An interest and comfort from private investors to support the initiative would be drawn from an IFC participation.  Through its presence on the Investment Committee, IFC can share with the Fund its experience in project finance.  IFC also can learn much from SEAF''s, five years of  SME operating experience in the region, about how to deliver cost effective and high quality investments to the SME sector. The proposed project has a substantial development impact.  Important impediments to the development of SME sector in CEE are lack of access to equity capital, limited availability of long-term lending, and technical training.  The Fund will directly contribute to enhancing enterpreneurship and efficiency in investee enterprises by providing transfer of know-how to strengthen their competitiveness in domestic and international markets.  In general, the target countries have well-educated populations with good technical skills and entrepreneurial talents.

Forestal Trillium,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,"Venezuela, Republica Bolivariana de",Forestal Trillium,Regional Industry - MAS LAC,1999-04-20T04:00:00Z,"",B,Loan,"Summary Of Project Information (SPI)Project Name:Venezuela: Forestal Trillium de VenezuelaRegion:Latin America and CaribbeanSector:Project No:009463Projected Board Date:May 21, 1999Company Name:Forestal Trillium de Venezuela, C.A.Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders	The major sponsor and shareholder is Trillium Corporation, based in Bellingham, Washington, U.S.A.  Associated with Trillium on the project is Harry Merlo, (Chairman and CEO of Louisiana Pacific, 1974-1995) who pioneered the commercial development of engineered wood products, including OSB, for Louisiana Pacific in the 1970s.  Also involved in the project is James Eisses, who served as Executive Vice President and Director of Engineered Products during his tenure with Louisiana Pacific from 1974-1995.  Messrs. Merlo and Eisses will be providing important marketing and technical production expertise, respectively.Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment	The project cost is estimated at US$91 million, and IFC''s proposed investment will amount to US$61 million, including a US$17 million A Loan for IFC''s own account; a US$38 million B Loan for the account of participants, and an equity investment of up to US$6 million, also for IFC''s own account.Location of Project and Description of Site	The Forestal Trillium plant will be located in the industrial area of Ciudad Guayana, Venezuela, about 20 km west of the port of Palua on the Orinoco River.  The project will be integrated with the operations of an existing sawmill, Corporation Forestal Uverito (CFU)and will benefit from existing infrastructure (roads, electric power, etc.) on the project site.Description of Company and Purpose of Project(include IFCs Role and Development Impact)	Forestal Trillium will be an integrated forestry products project involving the design, construction and operation of a plant to produce oriented strand board (OSB) and dry-process hardboard (""Hardboard"") from a Government sponsored, Caribbean Pine plantation in Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela.	Forestal Trillium will use fiber from this plantation, in the form of pulp logs and residual output from the existing CFU saw mill to create value-added products for export.  Construction will take an estimated 21 months.The Trillium Corporation sponsors seek long-term and competitively priced financing for their project, which is not available in Venezuela. While Forestal Trillium will benefit significantly from the existing CFU sawmill and infrastructure forming part of the venture, this project should be regarded more as a greenfield, project finance operation, with its implementation period of 21 months.  As such, the project requires appropriate grace periods and tenors to ensure proper capitalization.Given that this is Trillium Corporations first operation in Venezuela, a country with a difficult political and economic environment, it is looking to IFCs experience in structuring bankable project finance transactions in Venezuela.  Beyond IFCs general sector knowledge, Trilliums Management also values IFCs specific acquaintance with the Caribbean Pine plantation related to the project. In 1995, IFCs Technical Department appraised the plantation in connection with a mandate to advise the Venezuelan Government on the privatization of CVG-PROFORCA.  While such privatization never materialized, IFC gained valuable information on the plantation at that time which it can now share with the project sponsors and potential investors.The development impact of the Trillium Forestal project is positive.  Most importantly, the Venezuelan Government (CVG) is eager for Trilliums project to materialize given that its Caribbean Pine plantation is mature, overgrown and in great need of harvesting.  Trees are beginning to decay and are entering a use it or lose it phase.  The Trillium Forestal project will thus help CVG start to generate returns on its investment of the last 30 years. Trillium Corporation can also bring important advantages to CVG and the Venezuelan forestry industry by offering technical advice based on its extensive experience with sustainable forestry management and the superior leadership to be provided by its project team.  Finally, this project will allow IFC to play an important catalytical role in bringing long-term financing into Venezuela.  Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria. The following potential environmental, social, health and safety impacts were analyzed:  plantation management (including pest control) and sustainable harvesting issues, site acquisition, air emissions from processing facility, water use and waste water management, solid waste management and disposal, adequacy of transport and infrastructure to export, fire protection and emergency response, and occupational health and safety.The plantations, from which the sponsor will obtain raw wood, cover an area of approximately 800,000ha - of which 450,000ha have been planted with Caribbean Pine over a period of 30 years.    The management of the plantation provides for appropriate environmental protection through retention of areas of natural vegetation, and controls on the use of agrochemicals and erosion.The construction of the mill sites will not result in damage to ecologically sensitive habitats and has not required resettlement or economic displacement.  The sponsor will also develop a docking facility on the Orinoco River.  The final location of this site has yet to be agreed but the sponsor has confirmed that any development will be in accordance with World Bank Group (WBG) requirements. Air emissions from processing activities will be in compliance with World Bank Group requirements. The only wastewater that will be generated from processing is clean up water (which will be re-used in the manufacturing process) and septic waters from bathroom facilities which will be discharged to a septic tank. Solid waste will comprise bark/process fines which cannot be used for product and which will be burnt in an incinerator (with ash disposal as soil conditioner).  Other waste arisings are small and include scrap metal and office materials which will be disposed of in a municipal landfill.The mill buildings will be sprinklered throughout, and the mills will be operated in accordance with a health and safety plan with standards equal to or exceeding those recommended by the American Panel Board Association model guidelines.The  is  April 21, 1999 from the Public Information Center.Host country location of environmental documentsVenezuelaDate SPI sent to InfoShop April 20th 1999This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

Though a Newmont affiliate manages the Company, the Company''s employees consist almost entirely of Peruvian nationals, including the Company''s general manager.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The project cost is approximately US$120 million, to be financed, as currently contemplated, with US$20 million of A loan, US$40 million of B loan, and US$60 million of internal cash generation.Location of project and Description of site	The project is located in northern Peru approximately 47 km north of the city of Cajamarca at an altitude of 4,000 meters above sea level.	The site is a current mining facility on a high plateau above the tree line.  Prior economic uses were primarily grazing land of inferior quality because of sparse vegetation, with a few pockets of irrigated agricultural land or commercial reforestation.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Yanacocha is currently the largest gold mine in Latin America.  It produced 1.3 million oz of gold in 1998.  It was started in 1993 with financing provided by IFC.  Due to the emerging markets debt crisis and Peruvian borrowers'' reduced access to long-term credit, the Company requested financing from IFC.	The project is the development of the La Quinua deposit, containing approximately 7 million reserve oz of gold, which will replace the production of exhausting deposits and increase the mine''s total production and life.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a Category A project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure. Environmental, health and safety issues include: dust and exhaust emissions; water resources and quality; water impoundments (process, storm water, and sediment ponds); natural ecosystems; handling of hazardous materials; occupational health and safety; emergency response; waste management; and reclamation and closure. Social issues include: relocation of approximately 26 families, whose presence was seasonal (the ""Landowners""); economic displacement resulting from acquisition of farm lands; and social development in the area of mine influence.	Land for La Quinua was purchased through market transactions, with adequate compensation for assets and improvements.  The Company either constructed houses for the Landowners at a new site, or they were paid the equivalent value in compensation. Approximately 30% of the Landowners relocated out of the immediate area, most to the City of Cajamarca.  Significant assistance was provided through relocation assistance, priority hiring, production intensification on remaining land, and participation in various assistance programs administered by the Companys rural development program.  Project impacts on surrounding communities were addressed through consultation and negotiation on compensation.

Iberdrola serves over eight million customers and operates 16,000MW of installed capacity in Spain.  In 1997, Iberdrola had a net worth of about US$ 8.3 billion and a net income of about US$ 720 million.  Other shareholders include:  Paz Holdings SPC owns 33% of Electropaz and is an investment vehicle owned by US institutional investors including AIG-GE Capital Latin America Fund, Edison Capital, and GE Capital Services Structured Finance Group, Inc.; and Banco Central Hispano Americano, S.A. owns 10% of Electropaz and is a Spanish Bank with a presence in Latin America.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	IFC''s proposed investment is a US$25 million ""A"" Loan.Location of project and Description of site	Electropaz is majority owned by Iberdrola, the largest private electric utility in Spain.  Iberdrola acquired Electropaz in December 1995 from Cobee, Bolivias largest private utility, which was required under the 1994 Electricity Law to divest its distribution assets.  Electropaz has a 40-year Concession Agreement, services about 250,000 customers (more than 85% are residential customers) and distributes around 35% of all the electricity distributed in Bolivia.  Though the company has implemented measures to improve its efficiency, there are plans to make substantial investments over the next few years to expand the service area and realize additional improvements in system losses.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The project involves the improvement of the distribution system of Electropaz, a private Bolivian electricity distribution company serving the cities of La Paz and El Alto.  IFC is considering extending a corporate loan in the form of a US$25 million A Loan.  IFC''s role in providing this financing is to develop the effective functioning of the distribution sector which is critical for the long-term development of a competitive and efficient private power sector.  This investment will enhance the quality of service to the end consumer. Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.  Environmental, social and health and safety issues associated with the project include:  existing environmental conditions, siting and right-of-way alignment for new facilities, solid and liquid waste management, management of transformers or equipment containing PCBs, possible impacts on local residents, and worker health, safety and training programs.  The supply of energy to the city of La Paz is currently provided through 10 substations with underground network feeder of medium tension.  The city of El Alto supply is through 5 substations with aerial network feeders.  Electropaz has established a master plan that identifies all the measures to improve the operation of electric power distribution including the upgrading and improvement of several substations.  Electropaz has prepared a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) for the phase-out of capacitors containing PCBs.  Solid waste such as soil generated during the various activities will be reused in the construction activities; other materials such as wires, and cables will be recycled.  Domestic waste generated will be collected by a private contractor and disposed of according to local regulations.  In the Tejada Alpacoma area of El Alto, a high-tension tower caused concern among the community when severe rains caused a landslide in an area approximately 100 meters away.  Electropaz, the community of Alpacoma, and the municipal government had several meetings in which information regarding the project was presented to the community.  The number of participants in the meetings was about 80 people.  An agreement on siting and alignment between the parties was reached on February 12, 1999.  No significant impact on residences or property will take place.  Electropaz has a formal training and safety program for employees.  The training for operators is provided every six months, and for others once a year.  Employees are required to use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and the level of safety for the PPE depends on the type of work performed.The  is  from the InfoShop.Host country location of environmental documentsBolivia and the United States of AmericaDate SPI sent to InfoShop May 6th 1999This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

Befin is in turn controlled by Compagnie Internationale de Cultures (Intercultures), an affiliate of the Belgian holding company Société Financière des Caoutchoucs(SOCFIN), and other investors include IFC, DEG, PROPARCO, and Compagnie des Caoutchoucs de Pakidié. SOCFIN is part of the Rivaud and Bolloré groups, which have large investments in Africa. SOCFIN directly or indirectly owns oil palm companies in Côte dIvoire, Cameroon, Malaysia, and Indonesia, and currently manages 169,584 ha of oil palm plantations and 36,600 ha of rubber plantations in Asia and Africa. SOGB is managed by Socfin Consultant Services (SOCFINCO), a key affiliate of SOCFIN, which specializes in providing management as well as consulting services to the oil palm and rubber industries.    Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The total project cost is estimated at US$23.8 million. The cost of the agricultural component (Phase I) to be partly financed by IFC is estimated at US$10.3 million.The IFC loan of US$6million will finance about 58% of the Phase I investment program, while the remaining funding will be financed by the revenues of the Company''s rubber operations.Location of project and Description of site	The project is located on the SOGB concession, 25-km northeast of Grand-Béréby in the southwestern part of Côte dIvoire. Description of Company and Purpose of Project	SOGB is the leading rubber producer in Côte dIvoire.  The Company exploits a 35,000 ha concession, out of which 15,000 ha are planted with rubber trees, mainly on the highlands. The project comprises two phases, consisting of: (1) the establishment of a 5,000 ha oil palm plantation, in the low-lying lands of the concession, and (2) the construction of a 20 Mt. per hour oil extraction mill in year 2003, to process the plantation''s palm fruit bunches. The project will enable the Company to optimize the use of its land, continue improving its overall efficiency, and diversify from rubber production. It will take advantage of the strong demand for edible oil in the Ivorian market and the UMEOA countries. IFC has already invested in the Company through the acquisition of 16.7% of the shares of Befin when SOGB was privatized in 1995, and is interested in supporting the Company''s long-term development and its efforts to improve further its efficiency. IFC will provide long-term financing that is not otherwise available in Ivory Coast as existing long-term liquidities have usually shorter terms and have dried up following a boom in investments over the last few years. The project will create about 250 direct jobs and additional contract jobs for field maintenance and harvest work. In addition, it will enable the Company to improve further the efficiency of its rubber operations through the redeployment of part of its staff. It will also have a positive environmental impact by reducing fire hazards through planting and thereby preserve the primary forests located on the concession.  Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure and the following potential environmental, social, health and safety impacts of the project were analyzed: impacts to natural habitat, potential impacts related to economic displacement, integrated pest management, air emissions, solid waste handling and management, water use and waste water quality and occupational health and safety.The area to be developed comprises land cleared for rice cultivation, low bush and scrub vegetation and degraded secondary forest and there will be no loss of primary or good quality secondary forest or other significant natural habitats. No new land is to be acquired and no economic displacement will occur. The company will implement standard Integrated Pest Management approaches as the oil palms develop and no banned or restricted agrochemicals will be used.  Air emissions from the CPO mill will be in compliance with World Bank Group requirements, waste water will be treated and used for irrigation and solid waste will be disposed of as fertilizer or for road construction purposes.The company provides training in the use and handling of all agrochemicals and provides worker health facilities (including a hospital).

La Electricidad de Caracas, S.A.C.A. (""EDC"")Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders		EDC is a vertically integrated private company which owns and operates 2,265 MW of capacity and distributes power to the Caracas area. In 1998 its sales revenues were about US$763 million equivalent and year-end total assets amounted to US$3.3 billion and net worth of US$2.6 billion. Net income for the year was US$128 million with an EBITDA of US$387 million. 	In addition to EDC, the EDC Group includes Corporación EDC which holds and develops international operations and non-regulated Venezuelan businesses including electricity services, gas, water and telecommunications. Corporación EDC has acquired CORELCA and EPSA, a distribution company and a vertically integrated company respectively in Colombia and CAESS and EEO, two distribution companies in El Salvador. Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Total project cost is estimated at US$100 million.  IFC''S proposed investment is a US$40 million ""A"" loan.Location of project and Description of site	The project is located in the capital city of Caracas and its suburbs.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	EDC is a private Venezuelan integrated electricity utility serving the Caracas area.  Founded in 1895, EDC (the Company) is the largest listed company on the Caracas stock exchange and is owned by over 68,500 shareholders. The Company serves a population of 4.5 million people and has over 1 million customers. 	IFC is considering extending a corporate loan in the form of a US$40 million ""A"" Loan and a US$35 million ""B"" Loan.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedure. The project includes significant environmental benefits (such as loss reduction and energy efficiency components) and social benefits (for instance, provision of electricity to previously unserviced neighborhoods).  As this is a corporate loan, the environmental and social review of this project focused on: (i) the capacity of EDC to implement environmental and social programs, and (ii) compliance of the project''s sub-projects within the corporate loan with the applicable IFC environmental and social guidelines and policies.  A specialist from the environmental and social review unit met with the Environmental Health and Safety Department at EDC and visited several of the project sites to be financed by the corporate loan.  EDCs Environmental Health and Safety Department has a history of positive participation in EDC''s developmental and operational activities.  The project will comply with IFC''s environmental and social guidelines and policies.  Independent audits of the Environmental Health and Safety Department''s capacity in twenty areas were completed in 1995 and 1998, and a third audit is scheduled for 2001.  The transmission lines component will not involve any relocation, land is being acquired in accordance with IFCs Involuntary Resettlement Policy, and EDC does not use herbicides in the maintenance of its transmission lines Right of Way.  The transmission lines will not involve people resettlement.	While it is not contemplated that IFC''s corporate loan would finance the generation side of EDC, IFCs environmental specialist has concluded that the two generating stations (installed capacity of 2140 MW) comply with the IFC Guidelines for Thermal Power Plants, except for one area. The older gas plants do not comply with the Guidelines with respect to NOx emissions. However, these older plants are to be phased out and replaced by combined cycle technology, which will be in compliance with World Bank environmental guidelines.  This is anticipated to be achieved in 2002.  Also, the new operations of EDC are PCB free.  The Company has disposed of 99.8% of its accumulated PCBs with the remaining to be disposed of by the end of the first quarter of 2000.  This disposal program is in compliance with the IFC Guidelines.  Across EDC, health and safety practices are state-of-the-art and housekeeping practices at all facilities conform with best international practice.The  is  from the InfoShop.Host country location of environmental documentsVenezuela and the United States of AmericaDate SPI sent to InfoShop May 17, 1999This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

The Government in 1993/1995 prepared an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the Bandeirantes extension project, including an analysis of route alternatives.  Updated environmental analysis for the final configuration of the extension project is contained in an Installation License application that AutoBAn submitted to the Environmental State Secretariat of São Paulo in November 1998.  AutoBAn must also submit smaller environmental documents for lane additions and intersection improvements that will be constructed within the current right-of-way (ROW) on the existing highways.  AutoBAn has prepared a comprehensive Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the operation of the entire Anhangüera-Bandeirantes concession.  AutoBAn has also developed a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) to meet IFC''s requirements under OD 4.30, Involuntary Resettlement, for land that is privately owned and must be expropriated and for relocation of fruit vending stalls occupying the ROW. 	The EIA Documents for the project were released to the InfoShop on April 3, 1999.  Consultation, mainly in the form of public hearings, with affected people has been underway since preparation of the initial EIA in 1993; the final alignment of the extension was developed through this process. The major documents were disclosed to the public in Brazil as part of the local process. Local disclosure has included newspaper publication of the Installation License in January 1999 and announcements of the availability of the EMP and RAP in AutoBAns newsletter which is distributed at toll booths.  Additional newspaper announcements were ongoing during April 1999.

Nestor Alesso, Carlos Aragon, Luis Aragon, Roberto Servente, and Hector MaurizzioProject Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Project Cost:US$217 millionProposed IFC Investment: US$20 million in CCI''s equity and US$20 million in subordinated, convertible, income participating loan.Location of project and Description of site	Concessions are located in Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and Brazil. Future projects are expected to be located in Latin AmericaDescription of Company and Purpose of Project	CCI is a medium-sized Argentinean company which has historically concentrated in the construction business.  Since the beginning of the 1990''s, when Argentina embarked in an ambitious economic reform and infrastructure privatization program, CCI has become substantially involved in the management and operation of private toll road concessions.  CCI has been successful in developing this business model in Argentina and in exporting it to Uruguay and Brazil. As a consequence, CCI is currently targeting toll road concession management in the Latin American region as a key area for strategic growth.  The project is expected to strengthen CCI''s capital structure and to provide it with resources to expand its activities. Currently, access to long term funding at competitive terms is very limited for medium-sized companies in this sector.  By investing in CCI''s equity, IFC would be supporting the regional transfer of valuable experience and know how by a successful and medium-sized company.  The proposed investment would further foster the development of private participation in the sector in Latin American countries that are engaging in road infrastructure privatization.  In the medium term, CCI is planning to open its capital by listing its shares in the local stock exchange; IFC''s presence as a shareholder in the Company would lend additional support to this process.  Environmental Category and Issues	The project is an environmental and social review category A project because of its current and future likely social impacts. Key issues include environmental and social performance of existing holdings within CCIs operating companies; compliance of future projects with local requirements and World Bank policies and guidelines, implementation of corporate environmental management systems.CCIs past approach to project implementation has been reviewed on a selected number of investments to evaluate compliance with host country requirements.  In addition, an evaluation of compliance with World Bank Group environmental and social safeguard policies and applicable guidelines was undertaken to determine the level of additional assessment and mitigation that CCI will need to apply to future projects.  Although CCI currently has in-house capacity to manage these issues, integration of social capacity and selection of external environmental consultants will be key to the successful development of the companys future pipeline of projects. CCI will prepare an Environmental and Social Management Plan which outlines plans for capacity building, key environmental and management functions, procedures for future implementation of IFCs Environment and Social Policies, as well as internal mechanisms for monitoring compliance and reporting to be prepared by CCI. IFC has already conducted training for 13 operational staff focused on project categorization, disclosure and consultation, together with a detailed analysis of World Bank and IFC environmental and social safeguard policies and guidelines.For future investments, CCIs environmental/social coordinator will categorize projects and consult with IFC for the first three project categorizations. On investments categorized as A projects CCI will be required to perform the full environmental assessment process required by IFCs environmental policies and guidelines for this category of project, including social review. A parallel due diligence will be performed by IFC.  CCI will inform IFC of Category B projects.  A format for the report will be prepared in consultation with CCIs social/environmental coordinator.  CCI will be required to submit a quarterly report on pipeline investments which will describe the investment, its location, the status of the investment and estimate likely social and environmental impacts.

Initial technical supervision and training will be provided by the machinery suppliers.  The technical expertise and general labor requirements for production will be recruited locally.  The project is sponsored by Mr. Ashok Kumar, an Indian national with extensive experience in tyre importation and sales, commodity trading and textiles.  Mr. Kumar is the Managing Director of Hercules Tyres Limited and holds 55% of the outstanding shares.  Other shareholders are Mr. Rohit Nandal, an Indian and Mr. Gbadebo Ayanwuyi, a Nigerian.Project Cost Including Proposed IFC InvestmentUS$3,222,000 equivalent including a proposed IFC A loan of US$1,300,000.Location of Project and Description of SiteProject Location:  The project will located at Plot c-3, Amuwo Odofin Commercial Scheme in Lagos State, Nigeria.  Description of Company and Purpose of Project(including IFCs Role and Development Impact)The project is a diversification effort by the promoters of Hercules Tyres Limited who have been engaged in tire importation and sales since 1992.  The proposed factory is for the retreading of used vehicle tyres.  The factory will manufacture tyre treads and fit these treads to used commercial vehicle tyres.  The factory will produce four tire sizes for lorries, trailers, tankers and heavy trucks.  The installed annual capacity operating on two 8-hour shifts will be 50,000 truck tyres per annum.  The main focus of the project is the retreading of trailer and truck tyres for fleet owners.  The project is based on the cold process of retreading which produces very high quality tyres of comparable safety standards to new tyres.  IFC will be providing a loan with longer maturities than presently available in Nigeria.  The project will help to reduce transportation costs in Nigeria by producing safe and cheap tyres for road haulage transportation.Environmental Category and IssuesThis is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.  Key environmental, social, health and safety issues associated with this project include: site history and potential for contamination, air emissions; effluent treatment and discharge; solid and hazardous waste management; hazardous materials handling and storage; fire prevention and emergency response and workplace health and safety. The site for this project is located in an industrial area which has yet to be fully developed and has never been in productive use. The tyre retreading process uses only small quantities of water to be supplied by borehole sources.  Small quantities required for the cooling lines will be recycled. No liquid effluents are generated.  However, small quantities of dirty water will be discharged to the municipal sewer in accordance with IFCs effluent discharge guidelines, and those of the Waste Management Authority.  Necessary approvals for discharges will be obtained, and routine monitoring undertaken. No significant air emissions are produced except for dust generated in the buffing of old tyres and through the use of raw materials.  This is not hazardous and will be recycled in the process.  A dust collection system will also be installed. A small oil fired boiler needs to be constructed within a secure structure to achieve containment in the event of a spill or breach. Raw materials will be stored in a separate building and only small amounts kept on the factory floor. A regular training program will be implemented for staff with respect to health and safety including the proper handling of hazardous materials, and in particular, chemical solvents and adhesives.  Plant and equipment have safety features already included in their design. No abnormal noise emissions are expected to be produced.  The plant incorporates sprinkler system and chemical fire extinguishers. Regular fire drills will be carried out; the Local Fire Department will carry out an annual survey and issue a compliance certificate.  The sponsor will ensure an emergency plan is prepared in liaison with local fire authorities and or services.The Environmental Review Summary is available from the Public Information Center.Host country location of 	Federal Environmental Protection Agency Environmental documents 	(FEPA)Date SPI sent to InfoShop		May 24, 1999This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

It is being built along the Murera river next to a river-forest and a prominent rock formation.  The site is generally flat with a gentle slope to the river. Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The project company, Meru Park Adventure Ltd, was incorporated in 1997 for the purpose of implementing the project. The project is to rebuild the Leopard Rock Lodge in Meru National Park with a 60 bed quality lodge targeted at the medium to upper end of the market.  This will involve construction of 15 double room cottages and other support facilities such as a dinning hall and kitchen, reception and a swimming pool.  IFC RoleIFC is to provide a long-term foreign currency financing and technical assistance. Development Impact The project has strong developmental impact as it will:  a) attract more tourists to the park thus earning the country about US$1 million in foreign currency. b) create employment for about 50 people; and c) provide a market for agricultural produce in the area.	Environmental Category and Issues This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  The review of the project consisted of appraising technical and environmental information submitted by the project sponsor and Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS).  Key issues associated with this project include: KWS regulations; Meru National Park (MNP) management; site selection; land lease arrangements; impacts on wildlife and the Murera River; local communities; public consultation; water and power supply; solid waste disposal; liquid waste disposal; staff and guest safety; and fire protection. While this is a category B project, due to the projects location in a National Park, IFC required completion of an independent focussed EIA.  This EIA was completed by the African Biodiversity Institute, Nairobi, Kenya, and included public consultation with key stakeholders (including local communities, Nyambene County Council (NCC), KWS authorities, MNP Warden, and NGOs) and compilation of an Environmental Action Plan (EAP).  A concise summary of the key EIA, Public Consultation, and EAP issues is provided in the ERS dated May 20, 1999, which is available in the Info Shop, as well as locally with KWS and the NCC.  The sponsor has committed to implement all recommendations made in the EIA and the EAP.  Given that MNP has experienced a decline in recent years and has suffered poaching and diminishing tourism services, it is anticipated that this project will result in significant environmental benefits, enhancing KWSs ability to manage MNP through construction of a Ranger Station, and bring benefits to local communities through social projects funded by revenue earned by the NCC, who own the project site. The ERS is expected to go to the PIC by May 28, 1999.Date SPI sent to PIC:			May 25, 1999""This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporation''s Board of Directors.

In 1998, Marriott reported net income of US$390 million. Marriott owns several other well-known brands including Ritz-Carlton Hotels, Renaissance hotels, Ramada International and Courtyard by Marriott. Marriott already has a significant presence in Central and Eastern Europe, including hotels in Moscow, Warsaw, Prague and Budapest. 	Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Total Project Cost is estimated at US$36.5 million. The Sponsors have requested IFC invest up to US$4 million for up to a 25% equity interest in the Hotel Armenia.   Location of project and Description of site	The buildings that will house the renovated hotel are located in central Yerevan, Armenia on Republic Square, next to a city business center and government buildings.  Description of Company and Purpose of ProjectHotel Armenia is currently the primary hotel in Yerevan. The project Sponsors plan to renovate the hotel to create a 223 room western-standard facility managed by Marriott. Hotel Armenia will be the first international-standard hotel in the Country. The viability of a 223-room business hotel in Yerevan is warranted by increased air traffic and business opportunities in Armenia. The prime location of the hotel will give it an advantage over potential competitors. The Project will substantially benefit from Marriott''s operating experience and its commitment to the project. The Hotel Armenia project will constitute IFCs first investment in Armenia. The project will facilitate international business development in Armenia by providing business travelers with international-standard accommodations. IFCs involvement in the project is central to raising needed equity and debt financing, insuring a proper structuring of the transaction and assuring the Armenian Government of the benefits of and backing for the project. IFCs involvement in a project in Armenia will have a significant demonstration effect, and therefore assist Armenias efforts to facilitate other foreign direct investments in the country. Finally, IFC will play an important role in facilitating the governments privatization program by investing in one of the first large privatized companies in Armenia.Environmental Category and IssuesThis is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.  Environmental issues associated with this project include sewage and liquid effluents, solid waste, asbestos and PCB removal, water and power supply, and CFCs.  Health and safety issues include fire protection, employee safety training and emergency response.

IFC''s proposed investment is a US$17 million ""A"" Loan, a US$26.7 million ""B"" Loan/DEG, a US$2 million ""C"" Loan and up to US$2 million in equity investment.Location of project and Description of site	The project will be located on the outskirts of Mombasa, which is Kenyas second largest city (after Nairobi). The site is adjacent to a similar state-owned project known as Kipevu I, and near Mombasa Port. Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Over the past few years Kenya has been experiencing epidemic brown-outs and load shedding, a situation which is stifling economic growth. The system operates with practically no reserve margin and, with 80% of its capacity coming from hydropower, is particularly vulnerable to hydrological variations. Unable to fund new generation capacity, the Government of Kenya invited the private sector into power generation in 1996, choosing also to diversify into thermal resources.	Kipevu II, which will be Kenya''s third IPP, is a 74 MW diesel power station burning residual fuel oil No. 6 to be developed under a build-own-operate (BOO) scheme. The project was awarded to Wartsila following an international competitive bidding process. Although bid as a mid-peak plant to provide power locally and to act as a back up to the hydroelectric system, the prevailing electricity shortage in Kenya will require the plant to be base-loaded for at least the first few years of operation. The capacity and output of the plant will be sold to Kenya Power & Lighting Company Ltd. (KPLC), the national transmission and distribution utility, under a 20 year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signed with Tsavo Power Company Limited (TPC), a special purpose project company formed by the Sponsors. Affiliates of Wartsila will act as the Engineering/Procurement/Construction contractor and the Operations & Maintenance contractor for the project.Environmental Category and Issues	This is an environmental review category B project.  Issues include air emissions and ambient air quality impacts, noise, water supply and liquid effluents, fuel transmission and spill control, liquid and solid waste disposal, fire protection and emergency response, general workplace safety, and cumulative impacts from the project and the adjacent Kipevu I project. The plant will be equipped with a 45 m height stack, an acoustically insulated power house, and fuel oil storage tanks with complete containment to prevent spills.  A comprehensive Environmental Action Plan was prepared. KPLC is independently building a transmission line that is not directly linked to this project. IFC is assisting KPLC to ensure that resettlement associated with this transmission line will be carried out in accordance with IFCs requirements.The  is  from the InfoShop.Host country location of environmental documentsTsavo Power Company Limited office in Nairobi, KenyaDate SPI sent to InfoShop: June 25, 1999This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

Currently, the company has operations in Egypt, Hong Kong, Uganda and Zambia, as well as licenses (but no operations yet) obtained through competitive tenders in Chad, Congo Brazzaville, Gabon, Malawi and Sierra Leone.The Project consists of financing the construction and operation of a number of small African mobile cellular networks through an equity and quasi-equity investment in MSICIH. The project will provide an efficient means of financing MSICIH''s plans to build cellular networks in the smaller African countries. The project covers expenditures through the year 2000.	IFC is providing long-term financing to countries and companies which would not otherwise have access to such financing, at a critical time in a number of these countries: when a stable private sector is just beginning to emerge. The telecoms investments will reach a wide range of countries and will introduce or re-introduce IFC to several countries, thus proving demonstrations of the value of private sector involvement in basic infrastructure services.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a Category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure. Issues include development of environmental and social management systems; environmental and social performance of existing portfolio; land acquisition; site selection and construction; right of way alignment; PCB''s and halons; solid and liquid waste treatment and disposal; fire prevention and emergency response; and worker safety.MSICIH has undertaken to ensure that all majority-owned or managed companies within the group carry out business and operations in compliance with World Bank Group Environmental and Social Policies and Health and Safety Guidelines. The company has also committed to designate a person to oversee these issues. MSICIH is undergoing rapid growth and has also begun to develop centralized management systems and will include the consolidation of environmental, health and social (EHS) activities under one central management function with direct reporting from each subsidiary. MSICIH is developing a preliminary Environmental and Social Action Plan for IFC''s approval. MSICIH is also committed to undertake, and provide IFC with details of, future land acquisitions. In the event that activities will cause physical or economic displacement of people, MSICIH will consult with IFC and, as appropriate, submit a plan for relocation.Solid and liquid waste generated as part of the network installation and operations are limited and will be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. Existing equipment containing PCB''s will be phased out according to World Bank Environment, Health and Safety Guidelines.

Scancem International is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Scancem AB (Scancem) of Malmö, Sweden. Over 16% of the equity will be provided equally by two Bangladeshi partner companies and Union Cement Company, an integrated cement plant in the United Arab Emirates managed on a long-term basis by Scancem International. IFC will provide 8.2% of the equity and the remaining 20.5% of the equity will be provided by various Nordic development agencies.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	US$49.5 million estimated project cost. IFC proposes an A-loan of US$10 million and equity of US$2.0 million.Location of Project and Description of site	A clinker grinding plant will be constructed on 14 acres of riverside land in Kanchpur, an industrial area 15 km from the centre of Dhaka on the Shitalakkhya river. The sites riverfront is 120 metres long. A jetty will be constructed for the inward movement of all raw materials. Some 15-20% of output is also expected to be carried by river barge, the remainder being transported by truck. Clinker will be imported into Bangladesh in voyage-chartered ocean-going bulk carriers of around 30,000 DWT in size and will be transferred to fully enclosed river vessels at the outer anchorage of the port of Chittagong. The river vessels, which will be time-chartered, will transport the clinker to the plant near Dhaka where it will be converted into cement, bagged and distributed.Description of Company and Purpose of ProjectThe project will enable SBL to supply high quality-cement to the country at competitive prices. SBL will bring to bear state-of-the-art technology; low cost, high quality raw materials; operational know-how; and superior management skills. At present, the Bangladeshi market is largely supplied by imports of bagged cement. There are no economically exploitable deposits of cement grade limestone in the country. The project will result in the regular supply of up to 680,000 tonnes of fresh cement of consistent quality to Bangladeshi consumers. Domestic competition in the cement industry will be intensified and the transportation and handling of a significant proportion of imported clinker will be made more efficient without burdening the countrys congested ports infrastructure.Environmental Category and Issues	 This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure. Environmental and social issues of concern in this project included emission controls and site aspects related to existing residents. Adequate measures have been taken in project design to minimize dust emissions during handling, grinding and bagging.  There are no wastewater emissions.

The balance of Faplacs shares is traded on the Buenos Aires stock exchange. Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The total project cost is estimated at US$95.5 million. IFC is considering a US$10 million A Loan and a US$5 million convertible loan (C Loan), both for its own account.Location of project and Description of site	The proposed project consists of the construction of a particle board and finished panels plant in Zárate, an industrial zone located in the province of Buenos Aires. The Zárate plant will replace Faplacs existing particle board plant in Tigre, province of Buenos Aires.   Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Faplac S.A. pioneered the production of particle board in South America in the 1960s and is currently one of Argentinas largest producers of particle board. The company''s product line includes raw panels, plastic laminate, decorative paper coated panels and wood veneered panels. The companys 1998 total sales reached US$48.3 million, or 115,000 m³ of particle board, of which about 87% was sold in the domestic market and the remaining 13% was exported. Over the last few years, Faplac has averaged about 35% market share. 	The new plant will employ state of the art technology, providing significant cost-savings in the two most important raw materials: wood and resins. In addition, the project will allow Faplac to increase production capacity, improve quality, introduce new value-added products, and enhance market presence domestically and internationally.By financing the construction of an modern particle board plant outside of the Greater Buenos Aires area, the project will attract investment to less industrialized parts of the country, and assist Argentina in maximizing its comparative advantage in the forestry products sector by contributing to its growth and development. Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure. Key issues considered during appraisal include:  plantation management and sustainable harvesting; environmental issues associated with closure of the existing plant at Tigre; acquisition of the Zárate site; compliance with World Bank Group environmental requirements; fire protection and emergency response; occupational health, safety and social issues relating to change of processing location and any retrenchment. The Company currently operates three plantations and no wood is obtained from natural forest. The plantations are long established and well managed with appropriate fire-breaks and control systems as well as Integrated Pest Management. The company is considering acquisition of other areas set aside for plantations. These would be managed in the same way as existing Faplac plantations and would not result in significant adverse impacts to natural habitats. The Tigre site will close in September 1999. While a 1997 survey indicated elevated levels of phenols and hydrocarbons in soils and groundwaters in and around the site, this is not attributable to Faplac. Local planning and environmental authorities are aware of this issue and are content that Faplac has no liabilities with regard to the contaminated land.The new production site at Zárate is within a designated industrial development area west of the city. The site was formerly farmland, no resettlement has been required and no economic displacement has occurred. The Zárate site is being designed to comply with World Bank Group requirements and the wood products from the plant will be E1 certified. Closure of the Tigre plant will result in significant improvements in local air quality.At Zárate, a comprehensive fire control system has been installed throughout the plant and fire control systems are adequate at other sites. The company provides appropriate training and provision of personal protective equipment to staff and there are adequate occupational health and safety controls.A compensation program has been developed to address retrenchment, and severance payments will be paid in accordance with Argentinean requirements.The  is  from the InfoShop.Host country location of environmental documentsAt the gate of the new plant whose address is:Camino de la Costa Brava S/N(2800) - ZárateProvincia de Buenos AiresRepública ArgentinaDate SPI sent to InfoShop August 23, 1999This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

The major shareholders of Mabati Rolling Mills Ltd. are: Costronal Holdings SA (49%); Clovis Company (45.6%); and Kenya Aluminium and Industrial Works Ltd. (KAIW) (5.4%).Project Cost Including proposed IFC investmentEstimated Project Cost:	US$30.4 million. Proposed IFC Investment: a Senior Loan (A loan) of US$7.0 million and a Subordinated Loan (C loan) of US$4 5 million.Location of project and Description of site	The project will be located adjacent to the company''s Cold Rolling Mill (CRM) at Mariakani near Mombasa, Kenya. Mariakani is a small rural town situated about 40 km from Mombasa along the Mombasa-Nairobi road. It is within close proximity of the main Kenya railroad that runs to Uganda and is also close to the main Port of Mombasa.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Mabati Rolling Mills, the Company, currently has two operations i.e., a Cold Rolling Mill (CRM), which obtained ISO 9002 certification in 1998, and a small chemicals plant. The CRM produces a wide range of cold rolled steel to suit variety of individual applications. The chemical plant produces caustic soda, hydrochloric acid and sodium hypochlorite for Group companies and also for sale in the external market. The Company is one of the flagship companies of the Comcraft Group in Kenya. The Comcraft Group is a multinational group with wide interests in East Africa and in other African countries, as well as well-established operations in Asia and Europe. One of the Group''s companies in Kenya, Galsheet Kenya Ltd (Galsheet) operates two galvanizing lines (one each at Mombasa and Nairobi) and a color coating line.  	The purpose of the project is to replace the two existing galvanizing lines of Galsheet with a single state-of-the-art unit at Mariakani near Mombasa. The technology chosen is a non-oxidizing furnace-type hot dip galvanizing and Al-Zn coating with an on-line annealing. The new plant will have the capacity to manufacture 80,000 tons per annum of highest quality galvanized and Al-Zn coated coils for the local market as well as for exports in the region. Hot rolled steel coils (mostly imported from Japan, Europe and South Africa) are processed by the Company''s in-house Cold Rolling Mill into cold rolled coils, which in turn will be used for the manufacturing of galvanized and Al-Zn coated coils. These coils will be partly used for producing color coated coils. The galvanized/Al-Zn/color coated coils will, after undergoing further processing into plain, corrugated and other profiles, be used mainly for industrial and residential roofing. The project will: introduce new technology (Al-Zn coating) and products to the East African and neighboring market; provide benefits to consumers (e.g. for housing in lower income rural areas) of higher quality and longer lasting goods at comparable prices; provide further development of Mariakani and the adjoining areas as the industrial activity gets a boost with the new plant converting the existing operations into a mini-industrial complex; create indirect employment in the Mariakani and adjoining areas, as a result of the increased industrial activity; generate increased foreign exchange earnings by export diversification as sales to regional markets are realized; and provide an opportunity for local participation in the investment as the Company ultimately is listed.

The Legion has vast experience in constructing and operating education centers in Mexico and other parts of the world. The Legion is a non-profit religious order whose primary objective is to provide quality education throughout the world. Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The project, the first two stages of a four-stage construction plan, has an estimated cost of US$27.7 million. The proposed IFC financing consists of two A loans of US$6.5 million and US$3.2 million, corresponding to the two project stages.Location of project and Description of site	The 5 schools to be built will be in the cities of Oaxaca, Durango, Morelia, Culiacan, and Cuernavaca. The Morelia and Cuernavaca sites are approximately 26,598 m2 and 63,889 m2 respectively, both sites are located in urban areas. The Durango site is 100,000 m2 and is located in a rural area. The Oxaca and Culiacan sites will require 50,600 m2 and 67,026 m2 respectively. The Oxaca site will be located in a rural area and the Culiacan site in a peri-urban area. The sponsor has indicated that the already identified sites for these two cities may change in the future. In this case, the sponsor is committed to undertake and provide IFC with details of future land acquisitions and to comply with World Bank policies and guidelines. Although not anticipated, any land acquisition requiring resettlement will be subject to the preparation of a Resettlement Action Plan to be approved by IFC prior to acquisition of the land. Description of Company and Purpose of ProjectThe greenfield project involves the first and second stages of a four-stage plan to construct and operate five private schools in the interior of Mexico. The project will create capacity for approximately 5,200 students from pre-school through primary school. The sponsors entire four-stage construction plan will provide education through high school for approximately 9,000 total students. Promotora de Centros Educativos S.A. de C.V. has been established as the holding company for the five schools.	The project will complement the efforts of the Mexican government to provide quality primary and secondary education in the provinces, at a time when it is under severe fiscal pressure in order to maintain macroeconomic equilibrium. The additional resources mobilized for education through this project will raise the government''s ability to target its education expenditures to benefit the poor. The project will enhance Mexico''s stock of human capital by graduating a very high percentage of students who will enroll in various universities and colleges in Mexico and abroad.     	Private education accounts for less than 10% of the primary and secondary education market, which is quite low by international standards. The Legion, one of the most prolific private educators in Mexico, has seen a rise in demand for its services and requests from parents to open schools in their communities. With 45 years of experience constructing and operating schools, the sponsor is one of the more capable institutions to supply the unmet demand for private education. However, there is currently not a market for reasonably priced long-term debt financing to help fund an education project of this nature.  Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedure. Key environmental and social issues reviewed include: site selection and site environmental and social conditions (including land ownership and land use); liquid and solid waste management and disposal; source and adequacy of water supply; use of asbestos-containing building materials; CFCs; and fire protection and life safety.Land acquisition was on willing seller  willing buyer basis. The Legion is committed to undertake and provide IFC with details of future land acquisitions and to comply with World Bank policies and guidelines. Although not anticipated, any land acquisition requiring resettlement will be subject to the preparation of a Resettlement Action Plan to be approved by IFC prior to acquisition of the land.Liquid waste (including sewage) will be treated at the municipal wastewater treatment plant, except in Oaxaca, where Educacion will use septic and absorption tanks. The Legion will establish a recycling program. The non-recycling waste will be disposed of at the municipal landfill. The Legion has committed to conduct an independent fire safety audit and implement all recommended mitigation measures. The facilities will be designed to meet National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards.

Major shareholders include Beleggingsmaatchapig Ella III of the Netherlands (35.2%), Montiron Shipping Corporation Ltd. of Liberia (10.5%), Inter Holdfin of the USA (10.2%), and IHF d.o.o. of Rijeka, Croatia (9.32%). No other shareholder owns more than 5% of the shares.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The project is expected to cost up to US$92.5 million. IFC would provide up to US$11.4 million of debt for its own account (IFC A loan), up to an additional US$11.5 million of syndicated debt (IFC B loan), up to US$4.25 million of ordinary equity, and up to US$5.375 million of preferred equity. Location of project and Description of site	The project will be on property leased under a 32-year concession agreement by Viktor Lenac, roughly 5 km south of Rijeka, on the Adriatic Coast of Croatia. This land includes Martinscica Bay, where most of the operations of the company now take place, as well as land adjoining the Bay to the south, where a US$43 million steel machining and steel assembly facility will be built. Behind the proposed new facility are stone cliffs, which will provide most of the stone used in shoreline civil works. US$12 million of the project will be used to purchase a large floating dock, which will be moored in Martinscica Bay itself.  Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Viktor Lenac is the only private industrial-scale shipyard in Croatia. It is listed on Tier 1 of the Zagreb stock exchange. The company performs repairs and conversions of vessels, as well as the construction and conversion of offshore platforms. The project is a five-year investment plan to improve the company''s productivity and to increase its ability to build and service large marine vessels and other constructions related to the offshore oil and gas industry. The project will create more than 400 new jobs and provide a strong boost to hundreds of other subcontractors and small businesses in the Rijeka area. Environmental Category and Issues	This is a Category B project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure. Environmental and social issues associated with this project include: additional air and water pollution control measures required for the new facility; solid waste management; reclamation of the area used to quarry stone; adequacy and implementation of occupational health and safety procedures; impact of redundancy following privatization.  Air emissions will be minimal. There are no power generation facilities or boilers on site (power is drawn from the grid). The metal working areas will be equipped with a filtration system for fugitive emissions. Emissions of particulate matter generated by quarrying a neighboring stone cliff face will be mitigated through dust depression measures. Victor Lenac has largely switched to high pressure water, instead of sand blasting, to clean steel sheets. Process and stormwater discharge is to the municipal sewer for which the company has the appropriate permits. Waste is disposed of to private contractors and a municipal landfill. Oil is recycled. The company is implementing occupational safety and health measures appropriate for the size and nature of the operation. The company has adequate fire prevention and control capabilities and emergency response procedures.The company has demonstrated strong civic responsibility in its support (financial and otherwise) of the local community. Its training programs target both employees and contractors: in 1997 and 1998 these programs recorded a total of 2000 participants.

(Laredo)Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders	Manuelita S.A., the second-largest sugar producer in Colombia and the most efficient, is both a majority shareholder in Laredo and technical partner to the company. Manuelita has been controlled by the Eder family for nearly 135 years. Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment	Project cost is US$51.5 million of which IFC will provide up to US$10 million as an A loan and US$5 million as a C loan. The Netherlands Development Finance Company (FMO) will provide up to US$13 million in parallel A and C loans.Location of Project and Description of Site	Trujillo, 560 km north of Lima, Peru. The site consists of 4,265 hectares of sugarcane fields and an existing sugar factory.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Empresa Agroindustrial Laredo S.A.A. is a former sugar cooperative converted to corporate form under the government''s program to reform the sugar sector. Laredo owns 4,265 hectares of agricultural land in Trujillo, Peru and grows sugar on 3,636 hectares. The company produces raw sugar from its own cane, and cane supplied by independent growers, in a 2,000 ton/day factory.The project consists of: (i) renewal and replanting of 2,900 ha of sugar cane fields; (ii) rehabilitation/expansion of an existing sugar mill to process up to 3,000 tons/day of sugarcane equivalent to 73,479 tons of refined sugar and; (iii) repayment of overdue retirement obligations and other labor costs and past due loans from suppliers.By assisting with the conversion of the company from a cooperative to a publicly owned corporation, IFC supports the governments program to reform the sugar sector. IFC also fulfils its role in supporting private sector development by providing necessary financing (and mobilizing additional external funding from FMO) for the substantial investments the sector requires for rehabilitation and expansion of existing production infrastructure. The project will enhance agricultural productivity and improve management of natural resources.  In addition, IFC enables productivity improvements within the sector by facilitating technology transfer to Peru from the better-managed Colombian sugar industry.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure. Key issues considered during appraisal included: site acquisition and management; pesticide use and Integrated Pest Management; sustainability of water supply and water rights; waste water treatment; air emissions from the sugar mill; solid waste management; hazardous materials use; retrenchment of workforce and social commitments; and occupational health and safety issues.The project will not affect areas of ecological or environmental significance and there will be no economic displacement or resettlement. The sponsor will protect and conserve all sites of archaeological significance that lie within the project boundaries and will implement an integrated pest management program.Exploitation of irrigation water is sustainable and abstraction will not adversely affect downstream users. Currently there is excessive use of water within the mill site which is discharged directly to adjacent fields as irrigation water. Additionally, filter cake  and distillery waste are combined and discharged directly to an adjacent open watercourse without treatment. Significant air emissions are apparent from each of the four boilers and the sponsor will replace all four boilers with a single new boiler (with appropriate pollution control equipment to achieve WBG requirements) by 2002. The sponsor has undertaken to install new equipment to address both air emission and waste water issues to IFCs satisfaction.The mill site contains large amounts of solid waste.  The sponsor has begun to sort and dispose of this material and will recycle/re-use waste where possible. In instances where re-use is not possible, waste will be disposed of to local landfill. Several sources of hazardous material are evident and the sponsor has undertaken to ensure appropriate and safe use and disposal of all materials.The sponsor has begun a program of retrenchment to reduce the labor force. This process has been undertaken in an open and transparent manner in accordance with Peruvian labor laws. The sponsor also acquired social assets (a hospital and three schools). The management and ownership of the schools have been transferred to government.  The hospital will be transferred to the local health authority or privatized. The sponsor has undertaken to maintain and improve contracts with local cane out-growers through the development of legal contracts with local suppliers and to commit to the purchase of cane. The mill site does not currently comply with WBG health and safety requirements and the sponsor has already prepared a detailed risk assessment of health and safety issues at the mill and will develop and implement an occupational health and safety plan acceptable to IFC during the project.The  is  from InfoShop.Host country location of environmental documentsIn several public and private institutions and offices including:Municipal Office in TrujilloMunicipal Office in LaredoUniversidad Nacional de TrujilloRector: Dr. Guillermo Gil MalcaDiego de Almagro 344Date SPI sent to InfoShop October 25, 1999This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

Cefas S.A.,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Argentina,CEFAS S.A.,"Gbl Ind, Manufact, Agribus & Services",1999-10-29T04:00:00Z,"",B,Loan,"Summary Of Project Information (SPI)Project NameArgentina - CEFAS S.A. RegionLatin American and CaribbeanSectorProject No009722Projected Board DateDecember 6, 1999Company NameCEFAS S.A.Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders	CEFAS is controlled by Petroquimica Comodoro Rivadavia S.A. (PCR), which owns 99.99% of the company. Petroquimica Comodoro Rivadavia S.A. was founded in 1973. It is owned by the Brandi family (57.67%), the Cavallo family (40.98%), the IIC (1.25%) and company employees (0.09%). PCR''s two main lines of business are: (a) exploration and production of oil and gas; and (b) manufacturing of construction materials (Portland cement and other quarried materials through CEFAS).  Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The total project cost is estimated at US$40.9 million. IFC is considering a US$10 million A loan and a US$5 million C loan, both for its own account.Location of project and Description of site	The project consists of: (i) physical restructuring of production facilities at Capdeville, Quilpo, Dock Sud, La Preferida, Zapala and Decavo; (ii) increase of quarry reserves and modernization of lime production facilities at La Providencia; (iii) construction of a new lime production plant at San Juan; (iv) establishment of a new distribution facility at Alianza; (v) general upgrade of environmental standards at all plants; and (vi) short-term debt restructuring.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	CEFAS S.A. is a medium-sized Argentine manufacturer of construction materials, with projected 1999 sales of US$33 million and assets of US$46 million. The company was founded in 1994 (but started operations in October 1996) when the sponsor, Petroquimica Comodoro Rivadavia S.A., decided to enter the lime market through a well thought-out strategy of acquiring some of the leading lime brands. In order to keep the lime operations separate from its main line of business (cement and oil & gas), PCR decided to spin-off the lime activity and created CEFAS. Since it was not possible to buy exclusively the brand names, CEFAS was forced to acquire the old and uncompetitive plants that manufactured those brand names. The  construction materials industry had been underinvested in for the last 20 years due to a recessive construction industry scenario and lack of financing options, especially for residential construction (i.e. mortgages). The construction sector is now poised for higher growth than the overall economy, thus increasing demand for CEFAS products. The firm''s goal is to exploit this opportunity by modernizing facilities, introducing new products and lowering costs. The implementation of the project is expected to strengthen CEFAS position in the marketplace by reducing production costs by 40% while increasing efficiency and productivity, acquiring reserves, developing new products and meeting national and World Bank environmental standards. Environmental Category and IssuesThis is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure. Environmental issues associated with the project include air emissions; liquid effluent treatment/disposal; solid wastes; and quarry reclamation. Health and safety issues include employee exposure to dust, high temperature and noise; and contingency and emergency response plans. The sites are not located near sensitive habitats and no resettlement will occur as a result of the project. During construction and operation, the sponsor will implement all needed actions to ensure that there will not be negative impacts. The sponsor has presented plans to address these issues and demonstrated that the proposed project will comply with applicable local regulations and World Bank policies and guidelines. The measures proposed to address the projects potential environmental impacts, for the existing operations, are being presented to CEFAS in a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) which includes the installation of air pollution control devices in all areas of dust generation; development and implementation of measures for the proper handling and disposal of liquid and solid residues; implementation of water reuse practices; and the development of quarry reclamation programs for all its current as well as abandoned quarries. For the new plant as well as its associated quarries, CEFAS will conduct an environmental impact assessment. A copy of this study will be submitted to IFC prior first disbursementIn addition, CEFAS will conform an environmental and health and safety corporate group and will develop a comprehensive environmental management system by which it will establish a detailed monitoring program, develop contingency plans, established occupational health and industrial safety programs, and employee training programs. CEFAS will annually submit to IFC a monitoring report to ensure ongoing environmental compliance during the life of the project. However, during the implementation of the CAP, CEFAS will submit biannual environmental reports informing IFC about the progress of the CAP. Based on its review of available information regarding potential environmental impacts and proposed mitigation measures, IFC concludes that, by project completion, CEFASs operations will be in compliance with the relevant World Bank environmental, health and safety guidelines and policies and with the Argentinean environmental standards. IFC will monitor CEFASs ongoing compliance with World Bank policies and guidelines during the life of the project by evaluating environmental performance reports submitted annually to IFC by the sponsor and by conducting periodic site reviews during project supervision.

During the last three years, multinationals such as Nestle and Danone have entered the Turkish dairy market, introducing new products and technologies. SEK, the state-owned dairy company, was privatized in 1997 and other medium-sized dairies like Sutaº and Kay Süt have enlarged their product range. The main purpose of the project is: (i) to increase capacity in products where the demand has been increasing steadily; (ii) to improve efficiencies and quality, and lower costs; and (iii) to introduce new products. The proposed project includes investments in yogurt, butter, cheese, fresh fruit juice, UHT products, mayonnaise, and whey filtration product lines. In addition, the company intends to increase the capacity of its milk cooling tanks and the number of distribution vehiclesEnvironmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure. The following potential environmental, health and safety problems of this project were analyzed: air emissions and wastewater treatment; solid waste handling; hazardous materials handling; plant hygiene; and general worker health and safety.  Upgrading is being done within the existing dairies located at Izmir and Eskisehir. No new land is being acquired, and no environmentally-sensitive areas are affected by this project. The Izmir plant purchases steam and electricity from an outside utility, and has no air emissions. The Eskisehir plant uses a natural gas-fired boiler to produce steam, and stack emissions from the boiler will be within World Bank Group guidelines. Both dairies have wastewater treatment plants for process effluents, and both discharge to downstream treatment plants which provide further treatment, meeting World Bank Group guidelines.The dairies meet international standards for hygiene and occupational health and safety.

CelTel Uganda,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Africa,Uganda,AIRTEL UGANDA LIMITED,"TMT, Venture Capital & Funds",1999-11-17T05:00:00Z,"",C,Loan,"Mobile Systems International Cellular Investments Holdings, B.V. (42%) is a holding company located in the Netherlands with cellular investments primarily in Africa and the Middle East.  MSICIH is known to IFC as the primary sponsor of Zamcell in Zambia (IFC/R98-167), and IFC recently approved an equity investment in MSICIH (IFC/R99-151). VEHBV (formerly Vodafone Europe Holdings B.V.) (37%) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Vodafone AirTouch plc.  In June 1999, Vodafone plc merged with AirTouch of the USA to create the world''s largest and most diversified mobile operator, and in September 1999 Vodafone AirTouch and Bell Atlantic of the USA announced a joint venture to combine the companies'' wireless assets in the USA, creating a nation-wide presence.  Vodafone AirTouch is involved in mobile telecommunications services in the UK, USA, Australasia, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, South Africa, Spain and Sweden, among other countries.- Project Cost Including proposed IFC investmentThe estimated project cost is $12 million, and IFC''s proposed debt and/or income participating investment is estimated to be about $6 million.- Location of project and Description of siteThe project is to improve CelTel''s nationwide mobile cellular network in Uganda.  This is expected to include expanding the network capacity in the Kampala area, as well as building-out the network into new regions of the country.- Description of Company and Purpose of ProjectCelTel launched cellular services in 1995 as the first cellular operator in Uganda.  At that time, IFC provided an equity investment of $640,000 and debt investments of nearly $5 million to help finance a $16.0 million capital expenditure program for CelTel to build a national GSM network in Uganda. However, demand has been greater than originally expected, spurred in part by strong competition from the launch of a second cellular operator (MTN Uganda), so the company needs to increase its network capacity and expand into new and potentially profitable areas of Uganda.- IFC''s role would include: - providing the company with long-term financing, which is scarce in Uganda; - assisting in mobilizing parallel long-term financing; and - demonstrating continued support for the development of Uganda''s emerging private sector.The development impact of this project is substantial, with cellular telecommunications quickly becoming an important method of communications in the country.  Indeed, cellular subscribers are thought to outnumber fixed lines in service at this point, increasing efficiency in the business community and connecting Uganda to the global economy.- Environmental Category and IssuesThe proposed transaction is classified a category C project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.  The original project was a Category B project and environmental clearance was obtained in 1994.  Environmental monitoring has been proceeding during the execution of the project.  In 1996, the Environmental Division reviewed an external audit of the company performed by the Ugandan Department of Environment.  This report confirmed that CelTel had implemented appropriate mitigation measures in the design and construction of the project, and had addressed the key environmental and safety issues identified by IFC at the time of appraisal.  Some recommendations were made and these have since been followed up with the company.  The company produced Annual Environmental Monitoring Reports in 1997, 1998 and 1999, and has also adopted a formal environmental management plan, a solid waste management plan, and a health and safety plan.  This project has demonstrated general compliance with the project specific environmental guidelines established by the lenders, as well as with local requirements.CelTel are also a subsidiary of MSICIH, for whom an IFC investment was approved in September 1999 for equity of $10 million.  Under the terms of this investment, MSICIH are required to produce an Environmental Management Plan which should consolidate all elements of the group''s environmental policy and operational procedures in one central management plan.The  is  from the InfoShop.Date SPI sent to InfoShop:November 17, 1999This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

The proposed IFC investment is an A loan of US$30 million.Location of project and Description of site	Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia, an urban area.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	AES Telasi JSC is the recently privatized electricity distribution company of the capital of Georgia, which serves approximately 370,000 customers, delivering 2,197 GWh of electricity per annum (a major part of total national energy consumption). The project aims to reform and rehabilitate Telasi in order to bring it in line with modern utility practices. The project costs will include the rehabilitation of dilapidated physical assets; installation of meters and modern billing systems; and reform of governance and staff structures of Telasi.  	Georgia has suffered severe power outages over the last several years due to a breakdown in payment discipline. This has caused personal hardship for the citizens of Georgia and has hampered economic development. This project aims to improve the level of payments for electricity delivered by Telasi, which is the largest electricity distribution company in Georgia. By improving cash flows available to pay for generation of electricity, it is expected that outages in Georgia will decrease.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedure because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines, or design criteria. The review of this project consisted of appraising technical, environmental, and social information submitted by the project sponsor, as well as a site review by IFCs technical staff. The following potential environmental, health, safety and social impacts of the project were identified: handling and storage of fuel chemicals; solid and liquid waste management; management of transformers or equipment containing PCBs; phase out of CFCs including Halon; and worker health, safety and training programs. Social issues include: management of land acquisition; economic displacement of people associated with the siting; and right-of-way alignment for new facilities and mitigation of the social impact of redundancies. The majority of the distribution system is underground with buried cable. The system is not located in any national parks or environmentally sensitive areas. The setting ranges from heavily industrialized to rural. The Environmental Action Plan (EAP) will identify active leaks, stop them and remove underground storage tanks and piping, unused electrical equipment, leaking transformers and vehicle repair pits and remediation of all areas. Additional research will be conducted to determine whether groundwater is used for potable purposes and if so evaluate the extent of contamination, if any, in the groundwater. Analysis of dielectric fluid were conducted and concluded that PCBs were below the method detection limit. Solid and liquid waste is limited to paper, scrap metal, electrical equipment, and oily waters from the vehicle maintenance areas. As part of the EAP, AES will also develop a program to segregate and dispose of solid waste according to type and level of hazard. AES Telasi has indicated that there are no CFC''s in the system. AES Telasi has implemented formal safety training courses initially for all outside workers and those dealing with electricity and materials. AES is also investing in safety equipment, reorganization of the safety department, drafting of a Safety Handbook, forming health care task force and implementing an annual health physical program. Most staff are members of the Professional Trade Union. A committee of specialist, trade union representatives, and AES Telasi employees was convened which developed a generous Voluntary Selective Severance (VSS) package. The company will also assist with the training courses and exams for those who opt for the VSS. Some 760 people have taken the package and left the company. The current number of employees is 1,699. Further reduction in staff are anticipated in April 2000.The sponsor has demonstrated that the proposed project will comply with applicable Georgian and World Bank Group requirements.The  is from the InfoShop.Host country location of environmental documentsThe Mayor''s offices in Tbilisi.Date SPI sent to InfoShop November 24, 1999This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

The IFC will provide financing of $2 million, consisting of an A loan of $2 million, of which $500,000 will be convertible into equity.- Location of project and Description of siteThe project involves the establishment of four LPG distribution centers in Ust-Kamenogorsk, Astana, the southern suburbs of Shymkent and the Saryn-4 microdistrict of Almaty.- Description of Company and Purpose of ProjectThe project involves the greenfield development of a network of LPG distribution centers. From these distribution centers, LP-Gaz will provide LPG in cylinders and bulk tankers to domestic consumers for use in home cooking and, to a lesser extent, heating. The project will have two phases. The first phase is already underway and involves the construction of two stations in Almaty and Shymkent. During the second phase, two stations will be built in Astana and Ust-Kamenogorsk. Work on these two stations is expected to begin in mid-2000.The company is one of the first small niche operators to emerge after the privatization of the regional LPG distribution centers. Such SMEs provide the necessary competition to ensure that regional distributors do not abuse their strong market position. Although a number of small LPG filling stations have recently been established, they generally have limited services, low safety standards and do not provide a stable supply of LPG to consumers.LPG is mainly used as a fuel for cooking, where its convenience provides a major advantage over alternative fuels such as wood, coal, kerosene, and natural gas. LPG is also more thermally efficient and cleaner (odorless, ash-free, practically sulfur-less and produces less carbon dioxide) than these alternatives. While natural gas is more convenient to the consumer than LPG, it can only be delivered through a natural gas pipeline, which is expensive to install. The company will help provide a reliable supply of LPG to domestic users, which will lead to an increase in domestic living standards. The investment will also ensure that the company operates according to acceptable safety standards.- Environmental Category and IssuesThis is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure. Out of the four sites, two, which were formerly vacant and have been already purchased, are located in industrial areas with no environmentally sensitive areas in their vicinities. These two lots were acquired through willing buyer/seller commercial transactions. The sponsor will confirm that the two additional sites to be acquired are not located near sensitive environments and that the acquisition is also being carried out as a willing buying/seller transaction. Since the sponsor will use state of the art equipment, they will ensure that only minor amounts of gas will be released during connection and disconnection. The distribution centers will only generate minor amounts of liquid effluent. Sanitary sewage will be disposed in septic tanks. The terminals will only produce minor amounts of domestic solid waste, which will be disposed in accordance with local requirements. Copies of the accident prevention, maintenance, safety and employee training programs satisfactory to IFC will be submitted to IFC prior to first disbursement. Each local filling plant will have an employee responsible for handling local health and safety questions and for following the company rules. By project completion, the sponsors operations will be in full compliance with the relevant World Bank guidelines and policies and with the environmental standards of the government of Kazakhstan. The sponsor will annually submit to IFC a monitoring report to ensure ongoing environmental compliance during the life of the project. Based on its review of available information regarding potential environmental impacts and proposed mitigation measures, IFC concludes that the proposed project is being designed to meet Government of Kazakhstan requirements, and World Bank policies, and environmental, health and safety guidelines.The is from the InfoShop.Host country location of environmental documentsThe ERS will be displayed at the gates of the existing Almaty and Shymkent sites and at the gates of the proposed sites in Astana and Ust-Kamenogorsk.

The other shareholders include the Metropolitan Group of Sri Lanka (21%), controlled by the Ambani family in Sri Lanka; TVG Asian Communication Fund (19%), a Hong Kong-based private equity fund; and National Development Bank (5%), a leading Sri Lankan financial institution. Telia, with over 6 million subscribers worldwide, had a net income of $288 million on sales of $3.6 billion in 1998. - Project Cost Including proposed IFC investmentThe project consists of the expansion of Suntel''s nationwide Wireless Local Loop (WLL) network. WLL is a system employing a radio-based technology platform to provide the final (last mile) access to the user. It is beneficial in terms of scalability, allowing it to be deployed in small increments to closely match subscriber demand, thus reducing unnecessary capital expenditure. Total project cost is estimated to be $110 million. IFC''s proposed investment would be up to $30 million, which would likely consist of: up to $22.5 million in IFC guarantees of local currency bond and bank debt, and up to $7.5 million in IFC equity or quasi-equity.- Location of project and Description of siteSuntel has a license for a nation-wide Wireless Local Loop telecommunications network to provide fixed basic telephony and data transmission services. At present, it covers 9 out of the 28 administrative areas it committed to serve under the license. - Description of Company and Purpose of ProjectThe project consists of the expansion of Suntel''s network. Suntel offers basic telephony using Wireless Local Loop technology. It commenced operations in 1996, and has grown to a total subscriber base of about 50,000, representing 9% of the fixed telephony market.  IFC''s guarantee of local bond and bank financing will enable the mobilization of a significant amount of funds, which would otherwise not be possible; it will encourage investments from non-banking institutional investors who would be unlikely to lend to an infrastructure development project without IFC''s guarantee; and it will increase the breadth of the debt securities market in Sri Lanka. IFC''s involvement will help fulfill the company''s desire for local currency funds, minimizing foreign exchange risk. The project supports the liberalization and development of a competitive telecommunications sector, providing low-cost access to basic as well as value-added telecommunication services with a customer focus.  - Environmental Category and IssuesThis is an environmental and social review category B project.  Issues reviewed include: - environmental and social performance of Suntels operations, including right of way alignment; - land acquisition;- access road construction;- development of previously undisturbed land; - tower site and base station selection and construction; - compliance of future projects with local requirements and World Bank policies and guidelines; - PCBs and Halons; - solid and liquid waste treatment and disposal; - fire prevention and emergency response; and- worker safety including exposure to excessive noise.Suntels land acquisition staff selects equipment sites based on technical suitability and market price of land in the area. Land acquisition is on a willing buyer and willing seller basis. Rooftop tower sites are negotiated with building owners, and required approvals are obtained from government and local authorities for the construction. Suntel has so far not built access roads, and no site has been selected or constructed in an area that is environmentally sensitive. New sites are selected according to procedures laid down by the government regulations.All equipment used in Suntels network is new, and no chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs including Halon) will be installed. Only minor amounts of solid and liquid wastes are produced. Generators used for back-up power supply are equipped with sound attenuation enclosures, as required, and fuel storage tanks are equipped with secondary containment. Suntels sites are equipped with fire extinguishers and other emergency equipment. The company provides employee training on environmental, health and safety issues. All employees are provided with personal protective equipment as appropriate to their jobs.	The  is from the InfoShop.Host country location of environmental documents1.

This project could have a major impact not only in developing and deepening Korea''s housing finance sector, but also in creating and developing a new asset class, Mortgage Backed Bonds (MBB) and Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS), in the less developed Korean fixed income market. MBB and MBS do not currently exist in Korea, but the market will develop following enactment of the Mortgage Backed Securitization Company Act, to be approved by the Korea Parliament in December 1999.The opportunity to establish KoMoCo results from:·	Liberalization by the Korean Government of mortgage lending.·	Legislation allowing the issuance of MBB''s and MBS''s - the last piece of legislation is a Mortgage-Backed Securitization Company Act to be enacted by the Parliament in December 1999.·	The substantial inefficiencies that exist in Korea''s housing mortgage market.·	The Korean government''s strong commitments to implement fundamental structural reform of financial markets by fostering greater competition throughout the financial sector and encouraging development of fixed-income capital markets as an alternative to bank credit.The project will:·	Diversify the country''s home mortgage lending institutions'' sources of funding through issuance of MBSs.·	Provide new products (ie. MBB & MBS) for local currency long-term investors and savings institutions.·	Improve financial sector liquidity through securitization of mortgage portfolios.·	Improve the affordability of housing and lower the cost of mortgage loans by making longer-term funding available, and by enhancing the liquidity of mortgage assets.·	Promote competition in a primary mortgage market which has been dominated by H&CB for the last three decades as to help develop the primary mortgage market in Korea by improving the efficiency of loan origination and standardization of loan files, loan file documents and mortgage loan quality.·	Improve the quality and efficiency of mortgage loan servicing.Environmental Category and Issues	Based on the available information, this is a category C project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.

The project fully supports the World Bank and IFCs medium term strategy for Malawi and substantially strengthens the privatization efforts of the government of Malawi.NICO''s privatization will be a significant step in the creation of a strong local private segment in the financial sector. The increased involvement of Guardian is expected to provide the financial stability and technical know-how that will be essential to ensure the future success of NICO and one that will add depth to the financial sector in Malawi and provide new products in the insurance sector. IFC''s warehousing arrangement is intended to assist NICO''s management, which is predominantly local, to become a shareholder in the company. Malawi has almost no local private ownership of business as most of the large institutions are either government of foreign owned. NICO will be among the first private companies in the country with a significant local ownership.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category C project according to IFCs environmental review procedure. No further environmental review is therefore required.

(ZCI), an Anglo American plc (Anglo) subsidiary, will be a major shareholder with 65% of Konkola Copper Mines plc (KCM). Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd. (ZCCM) will own 20% and IFC and CDC Group plc are expected to each own 7.5% of KCM.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Total project cost is estimated at $260 million to be financed by equity subscriptions and shareholder loans. IFC''s investment is expected to be $30 million in equity and shareholder loans. Location of project and Description of site	The project is the purchase and 2-year rehabilitation program of the mining and processing facilities of the Konkola, Nchanga and Nampundwe divisions of ZCCM. The Konkola and Nchanga divisions are located on the Zambian Copperbelt about 250 km from Lusaka, the capital of Zambia. The Nampundwe division is located 80 km from Lusaka. Description of Company and Purpose of Project	 KCM will initially focus on the rehabilitation of the assets, with virtually all aspects of the mining and milling facilities at each of the mines being refurbished and/or upgraded. The assets have suffered from many years of underinvestment, declining production and high operating costs and it will take a number of years to rehabilitate the assets, improve management and reduce costs. Production is expected to increase from the current annualized level of 180,000 tpa of finished copper to over 220,000 tpa of copper. Concentrate would be railed to the existing Nkana smelter and refinery for processing. The Nkana smelting and refining facilities will continue to be owned by ZCCM for the time being but will be managed by Anglo American plc. The copper industry is the most important sector in Zambia, representing 80% of the countrys total export. The revitalization of this industry in a sustainable manner is, therefore, crucial for the country, and has been a key component of World Bank Group strategy. The KCM assets are the essential part of this privatization, and IFC involvement would provide the final impetus to allow their successful privatization, which would create a significant development impact.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a Category A project. Existing environmental data is extensive and indicates that the existing sites produce adverse environmental impacts of a sensitive and diverse nature. Key environmental issues include: emissions of gaseous and particulate pollutants (particularly from the Nkana smelter); liquid effluent discharges; contaminated land; solid and liquid waste management; tailings dam stability; handling and storage of hazardous materials and; reclamation and closure. Occupational Health and Safety Issues include safety technology, safety management, compliance with occupational exposure limits, personal protective equipment and employee training. Privatization of the mines and associated facilities and future construction and expansion activities will result in a range of significant social impacts. Retrenchment of the workforce and interim management arrangements for the transfer of responsibility for the provision of services such as health, education, housing, water, sanitation and power are being negotiated between Anglo, ZCCM and the World Bank and will need to be carefully monitored. Other important social issues that have been considered include: public consultation and disclosure; involuntary resettlement; cultural property; health and safety; informal activities and settlements on the concession; anticipated population influx; and maximization of local employment and entrepreneurial opportunities linked to mining operation.

La Electricidad de Caracas (EDC) is the major private utility in Venezuela and is owned by over 68,000 shareholders, none of which own more than 14% of the company. Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The proposed investment is an emergency loan to EDC of US$30 million for IFCs own account.Location of project and Description of site	Venezuela has been devastated by extensive flooding and mudslides caused by three days of heavy rains from December 15 to 17, 1999. Estimates of the number of dead, in what authorities describe as the worst natural disaster in modern times in Venezuela, vary at this time, but exceed several thousand. In the Caracas area, the poor residents of the shantytowns that climb the mountains surrounding Caracas were particularly affected, leaving many homeless. The hardest-hit area was a 60-mile stretch of coast in Vargas, an area just north of Caracas. Vargas is within the concession area of Electricidad de Caracas. EDC estimates its damages at about US$100 million. In addition, it is incurring extraordinary expenses for emergency work and participation in the rescue operations.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The proposed project is to reinstate electricity service to poor neighborhoods that were devastated by the recent flooding. This includes restoration of public lighting and providing electricity service to small stores, gas stations, remote water and sewage pumping stations, schools, medical clinics and public offices. The bulk of the investment will be focused in the Litoral coastal area where 90% of the 90,000 residences were largely destroyed. Overall, EDC estimates that about eight percent of its electricity distribution system was damaged by the flooding and that the cost of repair will exceed US$100 million.	EDC has agreed to use the IFC investment exclusively for poor and middle income areas, which are the least profitable sectors of the companys business. The IFC loan will encourage rapid repair of the system in these areas, which otherwise would receive lower priority or be done after and to the extent that the company has received insurance proceeds.Environmental Category and Issues	During appraisal of a June 1999 IFC loan to EDC (project number: 009624), it was established that EDC has a strong internal environmental capability and corporate policy. The environmental review summary for this category B project, which was issued on May 24 and is available from the Infoshop, also describes the company''s approach to the development of distribution infrastructure. EDC has also reconfirmed its intention to comply with all applicable World Bank environmental and social policies and guidelines. Environmental clearance of this loan has therefore been given on the basis that it complements the June 1999 loan and in consideration of the emergency situation in the project area. The emergency loan is believed to be beneficial as it will be used for reconstruction of existing facilities to equivalent or better standards, providing enhanced public safety and street lighting. IFC social specialists will visit the disaster area as soon as possible and advise EDC on project implementation.The ERS for the June 1999 loan to EDC (project number: 009624) is available from the Infoshop.Host country location of environmental documentsThe ERS for the June 1999 loan to EDC (project number: 009624) is available at:C.A.

IFC proposes to (i) extend up to KRW20 billion (US$16.5 million) as part of a KRW100 billion (US$83 million) convertible bond issued by KDLC - subscribed by ORIX Corporation and IFC; (ii) IFC will also consider an A Loan of up to US$20 million; and (iii) a B Loan of up to US$30 million subject to market demand.  Location of project and Description of site	KDLC is headquartered in Seoul and has an additional three branches across Korea.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	IFC is helping to restructure Korea Development Leasing Corporation after the Korean crisis. The proposed project would represent IFC''s continued support for KDLC, in which IFC first invested in August 1977. The transaction involves supporting the efforts of KDLC to restructure its operations and financing to initiate the underwriting of new lease contracts in an emergent leasing industry.     IFC has a long-standing relationship with KDLC both as a shareholder and joint venture partner. Going forward, IFC proposes to remain engaged with KDLC as a key driver of the Company''s successful restructuring. IFC was instrumental in the establishment of KDLC''s joint venture leasing companies in Bangladesh in 1985 (Industrial Development Leasing Company of Bangladesh), in Thailand in 1991 (Ayudhya Development Leasing Co., Ltd.), and in Indonesia in 1994 (PT. KDLC BancBali Finance).The developmental impact of the proposed project would be considerable. First and foremost, the financing that would be offered to KDLC would act as the catalyst for the underwriting of new lease contracts, thereby allowing the KDLC to re-engage the emerging leasing market. KDLC would therefore play a leading role in revitalizing the supply side of the market.The transaction would represent a model of a lease company restructuring in action. KDLC would be one of the first firms to emerge from its restructuring and return to the market. KDLC''s restructuring, falling under the oversight of the Corporate Restructuring Coordination Committee (CRCC), is the first voluntary out-of-court, London-rules restructuring of a leasing company in Korea; out of 90 companies under CRCC-supervised restructurings, there are only two financial institutions and one leasing company. KDLC''s restructuring efforts also represent the first time in recent Korean history that foreign creditors have voluntarily agreed to write down debt for a Korean financial institutions.  The proposed project would also act as an important signal to various segments of the market. The investment is expected to highlight IFC''s confidence in the leasing industrys future as a viable and well-run business. On a broader basis, participation in this project would underscore IFC''s continued support of the Korean government''s efforts to restructure domestic financial markets.	Environmental Category and Issues	This is a Financial Intermediary (FI) Type 2 project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure.  KDLC will be required to undertake an environmental review of each subproject to ensure compliance with host country requirements, IFC environmental and social safeguard policies, and, if applicable, World Bank Group environmental, health and safety guidelines. IFC will assess KDLC''s capability to carry out environmental reviews. KDLC must obtain IFC clearance prior to making any investment with IFC funds in any Category A project.

Location of project and Description of site	Network coverage and capacity will be expanded in Lusaka, Zambia''s capital city, as well as in the northern industrial area known as the Copperbelt Region and the southern tourist area centered around Livingston.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The project comprises the expansion of Zamcell''s nationwide digital cellular network. The project would be a follow-on to a previous IFC investment in Zamcell, approved in 1998. Zamcell launched its cellular service in Lusaka, the capital city, and the Copperbelt region, in December 1998 under a 15-year license to operate a nationwide mobile phone network. Since the launch of the network, Zamcell is experiencing much higher demand for its services than originally anticipated. Zamcell is planning to meet this demand by expanding network coverage and increasing capacity. The huge market demand confirms the urgent need of the Zambian business community for efficient and reliable telephone services. The project would help meet this demand and support the growth of an emerging private African telecom operator.  IFC''s role would include: (i) providing the company with long-term financing, which is scarce in Zambia; (ii) assisting in mobilizing parallel long-term financing; and (iii) demonstrating continued support for private sector participation in the infrastructure sector.  Environmental Category and Issues	The proposed transaction is classified a category C project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure. The original project was a category B project and environmental clearance was obtained in June 1998. Operation of the network commenced in December 1998. The company reported its environmental and social compliance in February/March 1999 in conjunction with the IFCs initial equity disbursement, and was found to be in compliance with World Bank Group policies and guidelines at that time.

It is a response to the sluggish performance of Brazilian exporters following the currency float in January 1999. In part, this performance results from declining dollar prices of Brazilian exports. However, it is also the consequence of lack of long-term financing for export-oriented projects.  	The project will enable IFC to help a relatively large number of Brazilian exporters more efficiently than through direct IFC lending. Thus it will help these firms to modernize plant and equipment or to expand to meet external competition or to take advantage of new opportunities opened by changes in relative prices.

(Hospital ABC)Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders	Hospital ABC is an Institution de Asistencia Privada (IAP) a non-profit private hospital regulated under the ""Ley de Institution de Asistencia Privadas"". According to this Law, IAPs must have a philanthropic objective and their profits should not be distributed but be reinvested.	Hospital ABC was established in 1941 and it is governed by a Board of volunteers, all prominent Mexican and expatriate individuals. In addition to its medical reputation, the hospital prides itself on its charitable activities and runs extensive teaching and research programs. The hospital''s facilities include 200 in-patient beds and state-of-the-art medical technology. It offers a full range of diagnostic, medical and surgical services. Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Total project cost is estimated at about US$82 million. IFC''s proposed investment is expected to be in the form of an A loan of up to US$20 million, a syndicated B loan of up to US$14 million and a Stand-by loan of up to US$10 million. Location of project and Description of site	The project will be located in the Santa Fe section of Mexico City, a fast growing part of the city.  	The site was acquired from the Mexico City development agency.  It is approximately 67,200 square meters and is empty of any construction or settlement. Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The project involves the construction of a new hospital facility in Santa Fe that will complement the existing one at Observatorio. It will initially focus principally on out-patient services and will include a specialized ambulatory center (including day surgery), all related diagnostic services, a 24-hour emergency room, a preventive center, 60 beds for hospitalizations and a 100-unit medical offices building. The facility will also include a welfare clinic intended to deliver services to the poor, as per Hospital ABC''s mandate.       Demand for private medical services in Mexico City has grown very fast in the last 5 years. ABC Hospital is operating at high occupancy rates and needs to increase its capacity. In addition, the new facility''s location will greatly benefit the hospital. In a large and congested city like Mexico City, the location of services is a most critical element. In a fast growing competitive environment, location constitutes one of the main criteria determining the relative comparative advantage among the four leading hospitals in Mexico City. Due to space constraints, there is no scope for expansion at the current site, which in addition is located in a slow growing area of Mexico City.       The IFC financing will allow the hospital to increase its capacity and rationalize its operations. Hospital ABC will be able to serve its clients better and in a more efficient manner. IFCs long term financing is a key element of the projects financial feasibility. Finally, the proposed transaction is expected to have a demonstration effect to private banks and encourage future support of Hospital ABC and other private sector hospital projects.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedure because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

"Inter Sea Farms de Venezuela, C.A.",Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,"Venezuela, Republica Bolivariana de","Intersea Farms de Venezuela, C.A.",Regional Industry - MAS LAC,2000-02-10T05:00:00Z,"",B,Loan,"- 5 -International Finance CorporationA Member of the World Bank GroupInternational Finance CorporationA Member of the World Bank GroupEnvironmental Review Summary (ERS)Project Name	Venezuela  Inter Sea FarmsRegion	Latin America and the CaribbeanSector	Food and AgribusinessProject No.	009247 1.		The proposed InterSea Farms Venezuela (ISFV Comprising  a joint venture company  Sea Farms International (SFI) and Interaqua) project consists of an integrated shrimp-farming operation near Maracaibo, that includes a shrimp hatchery, production ponds (2,500 ha) and a processing plant.  The project is composed of two phases with phase one involving the construction of the hatchery, about 1,000 has. of ponds, and all farm infrastructure and equipment. Phase two is to be implemented two-three years after phase one and consists mainly of the processing facilities and an additional 1,500 has of ponds. At full capacity, the project will generate employment for approximately 274 farm staff, 80 hatchery staff, and 500 processing plant staff. IFC financing will be based only in phase one assuming shrimp processing will be undertaken by third parties however, environmental and social appraisal has addressed  both phases. As part of the development proposal, the sponsor has prepared and submitted an EIA for the project, which has been approved by Venezuelan authorities.2.		This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria. The review of this project consisted of appraising technical and environmental information submitted by the project sponsor as well as site visits and discussions with the sponsor, national NGO''s and government agency''s.  The following potential environmental, social, health and safety impacts of the project were analyzed:·	Habitat loss and other ecological impacts arising from development of production areas, hatchery and other facilities;·	Farm management and production issues;·	Water use and waste water management from production and processing activities;·	Solid waste management and disposal;·	Environmental Management Systems;·	Employment and occupational health and safety issues;·	Land acquisition process and possible impacts related to physical and/or economic displacement.The information provided about how these issues and potential impacts have been addressed in the development of the project are summarized in the paragraphs that follow.3.	Habitat loss and other impacts arising from development of production areas, hatchery and other facilities:  The farm site (8,000 ha) comprises an extensive clay alluvial plain that lies behind the main coastal sand dunes on the Gulf of Venezuela.  The area is flat (except for one line of residual dunes that will be retained in the development) and approximately 80% of the site is devoid of vegetation or supports coarse grass during infrequent periods of rain.  The remaining 20% of the site comprises xerophytic vegetation (Acacia and cactus) which are widely distributed throughout the states of Zulia and Falcon. The site does not support significant fauna or areas of standing water that might act as sources of food/security for migratory or other birds or fauna. The loss of these areas of natural habitat will not have a significant impact on the ecology of the area. There are no significant habitat issues associated with the siting or development of the hatcheries or packing plant.4.	To the west of the site lies the 26,000ha Olivitos Wildlife Management Reserve  whose boundaries were defined by the Government of Venezuela with support and collaboration from the shrimp aquaculture sector and others.  The primary objective of the reserve is to protect birds and other animals and the site  supports one of the most important flamingo colonies in the southern Caribbean.  A salt producing company - Produsal - is located within the reserve area (an area of 3,000ha along the eastern edge of the reserve) and has been abstracting saline waters from the Reserve''s lagoon for over 10 years.  Produsal provides a physical barrier of between 1-2km width between the edge of the ISFV project site and the main wetland and also acts as a barrier to the movement of freshwater from the east into the wetland.  There has been no evidence of ecological change within the wetland as a result of Produsals activities and potential impacts arising from the proposed project (through salinization or changes in hydrology) are not considered likely. 5.	Farm management and production issues: A semi-intensive production system is proposed  (15-20 shrimp/m2) and post larvae (pl) will be provided by two 60  million pl per month hatcheries which will be located at nearby sites on the eastern coast of the Paraguaná peninsula in the State of Falcon.  There will be no capture of wild pl.  The non-native shrimp species Penaeus vannamei is the culture species of choice for the project  and the sponsor will install grills and other control measures to reduce the risk of shrimp escape. P. vannamei  is widely used in shrimp aquaculture operations throughout the Caribbean region.  6.	Chemical use on the farm will be limited to the addition of calcium and phosphorus compounds (added as an inorganic fertilizer to reduce feed use through the  promotion of  phytoplankton growth)  and malathion or rotenone (to treat residual ponds following shrimp harvesting and drawdown).  Use of these materials will be controlled and the sponsor has demonstrated adequate management capacity at other sites to ensure that use will conform to WBG requirements. 7.	Water use and waste water management from production and processing activities:  Pond water at the farm will be  exchanged at the rate of approx. 5 % of volume per day, (2 million m3 per day at full project development) to maintain good dissolved oxygen levels and salinity conditions in the ponds.  There is an adequate and sustainable supply of water (which will be drawn from the Gulf of Venezuela) and abstraction will not have  a significant impact on other users of the Gulf or the wider environment.  At the proposed stocking densities, waste water effluents will be in compliance with WBG requirements (Table 1), however, in addition, the project will incorporate a  225 ha. effluent treatment pond, providing a greater than 24 hr. retention time before discharge water is returned to the Gulf of Venezuela.   The inclusion of the effluent treatment pond is to provide flexibility should higher stocking densities be selected in the future. Surface runoff will be directed to a large   (812 ha) retention area and then diverted around the site to discharge directly to the sea.  It is not anticipated that this will cause significant ecological impacts.8.	The soils at the site are predominantly clay and will form an effective barrier against the seepage of saline waters into the ground. There are no people or agricultural activities within or adjacent to the site that could be affected by changes in salinity.  Similarly, given the physical barrier between the site and the Olivitos Reserve, the risk of impacts to the wetland are not significant. The sponsor will be required to monitor groundwater quality as part of the project.9.	Wastewater from the (third party owned and operated) packing plant that the project will use during phase I is discharged to Lake Maraciabo  and data provided by the owner demonstrates compliance with Venezuelan standards and requirements. The new packing plant that will be designed to comply with effluent WBG requirements.10.	Solid waste management and disposal:   The principal waste materials generated by the farm and packing plant will be: sanitary wastes of employees, materials from office and cafeteria, repair shop discards including used motor oil, feed sacks, and shrimp heads. The sponsor will recycle and re-use material where possible and will dispose of remaining farm waste at the Quisiro landfill which will be improved through a joint program to be developed by the sponsor and local municipality. 11.	Hazardous Materials Use and Management: Hazardous materials that will be used include: diesel fuel, rotenone, malathion, chlorine, and lime. (Table 2). Diesel fuel will be stored in secure tanks with secondary containment.  Rotenone  and malathion application will be by trained operators, and chemicals will be stored in a secure location.   The existing packing plant uses Freon 502 refrigerants  and there are no significant emissions from other sources.  The new plant will use ammonia or CFC free refrigerants and will be designed to comply with WBG requirements.12.	 Environmental Management Systems (EMS): An EMS will be established and in house monitoring of key parameters will be undertaken. This will be complemented by periodic sampling by independent and government agencies as part of the permitting requirement of the Government of Venezuela. Responsibility for implementing and supervising the EMS will be assigned at the senior technical level, reporting directly to the projects General Manager.  The packing plant is HACCP and ISO 9000 certified and the ISFV operation will develop and implement similar quality management and health and safety requirements when it develops its packing plant.  The project will also be designed to comply with the Global Aquaculture Alliance''s  codes of practice for responsible shrimp farming Global Aquaculture alliance (1999) Codes of practice for responsible shrimp farming   GAA St Louis MO (http://www.GAAlliance.org).13.	Occupational health and safety issues: The sponsor will provide a full support and benefit package as required under Venezuelan law (social security and insurance, minimum wage + 20%, vacations and productivity bonus).

GWI is a publicly traded U.S. company whose subsidiaries own and operate short line and regional freight railroads and provide related rail services over approximately 4,700 miles of track in the United States, Australia, Canada and Mexico. In 1998, GWI''s sales were $147 million and its net income totaled $11.4 million. - Project Cost Including proposed IFC investmentProject cost is estimated at $48.0 million equivalent. IFC''s proposed investment in FCCM consist of an A loan of up to $12 million and equity of up to $2 million.- Location of project and Description of siteFCCM''s network consists of the Chiapas and Mayab rail lines. The Chiapas line is situated in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas. The Mayab line is situated in the states of Campeche, Yucatan, Veracruz and Tabasco. - Description of Company and Purpose of ProjectFCCM was formed in July 1999 to rehabilitate and modernize the FCCM''s railway network, including an upgrade of infrastructure, a rehabilitation of rolling stock, an upgrade of the communication system and an improvement of railway security. This project, through the provision of more efficient transportation services to the industrial and agriculture companies in the region, is expected to foster increased economic growth and thus help to remove obstacles to sustainable growth in the region. Removal of these obstacles is also expected to contribute to political and economic stability in the region.- Environmental Category and IssuesThis is a category B project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedure. FCCMs environmental management capacity is ensured through recruitment of an experienced management team and the assignment of GWIs senior safety officer to oversee overall safety and environmental activities. Training of operating personnel on FCCMs new operating rules was undertaken from October through December 1999, and other training programs are planned throughout the year 2000. FCCM expects that its trackbed improvement and employee training programs will reduce derailments and other safety incidents significantly when they are fully implemented in about two years. Handling procedures for cargos currently shipped by FCCM are well established in the industry.The national rail union represents the majority of FCCM employees. FCCM reached a new labor agreement with the union on November 1, 1999 that encompasses new work rules and represents Mexicos first compensatory severance, scholarship, and social adjustment package. The new contract includes severance payments to 55 employees laid off as a result of the new work rules as well as other payments to 1,000 staff previously let go at FCCMs startup. No additional layoffs are planned. Some of the personnel let go have been re-employed in railroad-related positions such as in-car service crew on passenger trains and the contracted security force.The concession contract indemnifies FCCM from liability for past contamination. FCCM has contracted for an independent environmental audit and is preparing a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) of facilities and properties turned over to FCCM. The environmental audit is completed and the CAP will identify key action items needed for environmental compliance at each facility. Receipt of a final CAP will be a condition of disbursement of IFCs loan.FCCMs rights-of-way do not traverse or abut designated environmentally or culturally sensitive areas, and no significant route realignments are expected. Vegetation management procedures will be adapted to requirements of each state in which the railroad operates and specific needs of right-of-way abutters. Specific herbicides that will be used have not been determined, and FCCMs plan for herbicide use will be a condition of disbursement of IFCs loan. FCCMs concession includes little property that is not directly related to its railroad operations. There is currently only limited encroachment on active track and yards; this does not impede day-to-day rail operations and the company does not expect to displace existing encroachers, either economically or physically, in the near future.FCCM has mostly wood ties on its system, and for cost and availability reasons the company plans to buy primarily wood ties in the future. Ties will be purchased from commercial suppliers, and are expected to be both hardwood and pine species from natural growth forests and managed plantations.

SREI International Finance is a publicly traded company in India.The Kanoria family has been operating SREI since its inception in 1989 and has demonstrated a strong track record in efficiently managing the operations of the company.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investmentIFC Loan: US$10 million; IFC equity: US$5 million.Location of project and Description of site	SREI International Finance is headquartered Calcutta and has several offices throughout the country.Description of Company and Purpose of ProjectSREI''s primary area of business has been financing (under lease and hire/purchase arrangements) heavy construction equipment to infrastructure related projects. In addition, a small portion of SREI''s business is in small and medium scale infrastructure project financing and this segment is expected to represent a larger share of the company''s future business volume. The project consists of making available a credit facility of US$10 million and an investment of up to US$ 5 million in subordinated bonds (with warrants) issued by SREI. The purpose of the funding is to allow SREI to further expand its small and medium scale infrastructure finance activities in the power, transportation and port sectors. The need to develop Indias infrastructure sector, to underpin the ongoing economic liberalization efforts as well as to ensure sustained economic growth and export expansion, is today widely recognized. The demand for infrastructure investment is expected to grow substantially as the process of industrial modernization accelerates and urbanization continues. A major constraint on private infrastructure investment, however, has been the lack of necessary market mechanisms to provide funds in terms of maturity, structure, and volume required. This is true not only of the larger infrastructure projects, but also small to medium sized projects, which are wholly dependent on local financial institutions for financing, particularly for debt financing. SREI is one of the few private financial institutions in India that have been engaged in financing assets in the infrastructure sector.

The main sponsors are Deepak Puri, an engineering graduate from Imperial College, London, and his son Ratul, a computer engineer from Carnegie-Mellon, USA. The company was originally promoted in 1983 as a joint venture with Moser-Baer AG, Switzerland, to assemble time keeping systems. But due to market limitations it diversified into diskettes in 1986 when the Puri family purchased the Swiss companys shares and also went public. Of MBILs total equity, presently 35% is held by the sponsors, 21% by IFC, 18% by Jardine Fleming group companies and 26% by others, including the general public.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The total cost of project is estimated at US$233 million. IFC is considering an equity investment of US$25 million and a term loan of US$45 million.Location of project and Description of siteThe project envisages an expansion in capacity at the MBIL''s existing Recordable Compact Disks (CD-R) plant site at Noida industrial area near New Delhi, as well as setting up a new facility at a greenfield location. While the location of the new facility is yet to be finalised, the company has identified a couple of sites in the industrial areas at Noida and Gurgaon, both in the vicinity of New Delhi. These industrial areas have basic infrastructure facilities of connecting roads, power, telecommunications and common sewage disposal systems. Skilled manpower and raw materials are easily available.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	Moser Baer India Limited is an existing IFC client and a leading producer and exporter of diskettes in India. Presently, the company is in an advanced stage of establishing a CD-R manufacturing facility at Noida to produce CD-Rs with a capacity of 171 million CD-Rs per annum. During the first nine months of the current financial year, the company has sold 92 million floppy discs and 3.4 million CD-Rs produced from the lines that are already operational. Net sales for this period have been US$22.6 million on which the company has earned a cash profit of US$7.1 million and a net profit of US$5.8 million (25.7% of net sales). Based on the projected sales of the last quarter, the companys sales and net profits for the FY ended March 2000 are estimated at US$28.5 million and US$9.0 million respectively. The proposed project (Moser Baer III) envisages increasing the companys CD-R capacity to about 700 million p.a. This increase in capacity will be implemented by (a) installing additional lines at its existing CD-R plant site and (b) setting up a completely new facility. The total project cost is estimated at US$233 million and is expected to be completed by March 2002.IFCs participation in the project would assist the company in becoming a world-scale, low cost producer of data storage products and is in line with IFC strategy in South Asia for supporting the high-tech and export oriented sectors. Besides earning foreign exchange for the country, the project would also provide employment to over 1400 skilled workers and engineers.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure and the following potential environmental, social, health and safety impacts of the project were analyzed: site acquisition and development; liquid waste; solid waste management and handling; hazardous materials handling and management; air emissions; occupational health and safety; Environmental Management Systems; and company environmental performance on earlier IFC investments	The expansion area at the existing site and proposed new factory site will both be located in industrial zones and there will be no impacts on natural habitats. The project will not result in economic displacement. Water use and disposal, solid waste handling, air emissions and occupational health and safety issues for IFCs existing investments are in compliance with World Bank Group (WBG) requirements. Expansion plans are being designed to comply with WBG requirements and both sites should operate in compliance. The company has a formal environmental policy and provides training in environmental matters to its employees. Responsibility for environmental matters has been designated to a senior Moser Baer Manager and the company has provided copies of relevant permits and operating licenses to IFC.

(COTCO)Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders	TOTCO and COTCO will be majority-owned by a consortium of private sponsors, lead by an affiliate of of Exxon or its successor or assignee  collectively the private sponsors. An affiliate of Exxon will act as project management company and operator. Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Total project cost is estimated at $3.5 billion: $1.5 billion for the oilfield development, to be funded by equity from the private sponsors; and $2 billion for a related pipeline export system, for which the IFC and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD or ""the World Bank"") financing is proposed. The export system is expected to be financed by $100 million IFC A loans, up to $300 million IFC syndicated B loans, $600 million from export credit agencies and commercial banks, a $400 million bond offering, $112 million equity from Chad and Cameroon, to be funded by IBRD and the European Investment Bank (EIB), and $500 million in equity from the private sponsors.Location of project and Description of site	The project consists of two components: (a) the development of three oil fields in the Doba basin in southwestern Chad, including drilling of about 300 wells and construction of associated facilities and infrastructure; and (b) (i) the construction of an underground 1,070 km pipeline from the Doba oil fields to Cameroons Atlantic coast at Kribi, three related pumping stations, ancillary facilities and infrastructure improvements, and (ii) the installation of off-shore export terminal facilities and an 12 km submarine pipeline from the Atlantic coastline to the terminal. Component (a) constitutes the oilfield development and component (b) the ""pipeline export system"", through which all the oil from the three Doba oil fields is expected to flow. All technology to be used is well known and proven.	The project area may be described in terms of five ecological zones described from North to South: the wooded savanna zone extends from the area of the oil fields in Chad to the general vicinity of Mararaba on the pipeline route in Cameroon (485 km); the semi-deciduous forest zone extends from Mararaba to Batchenga (310 km); the mixed forest zone from Batchenga to Ngoumou (80 km); the Atlantic Littoral zone from Ngoumou to the coast (195 km); and the marine zone from the coast to the offshore loading facility (11 km).Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The borrowers of the IFC loans will be:- TOTCO, a special-purpose company incorporated in Chad as a joint-venture between the private sponsors, and the Government of Chad, which will own and operate the Chad portion of the pipeline export system; and- COTCO, a special-purpose company incorporated in Cameroon as a joint-venture between the private sponsors, and the Governments of Cameroon and Chad, which will own and operate the Cameroon portion of the pipeline export system. TOTCO and COTCO will transport crude oil to the export-loading terminal through their respective portions of the pipeline export system.	The project, one of the largest single investment projects in the region ever, is expected to generate positive benefits for Chad and Cameroon over its operating period. In particular, it will generate tax and other revenues and should help ease some of the financing constraints faced by the two countries, particularly Chad, one of the world''s poorest countries. Additional benefits arise from infrastructure improvements, and significant foreign direct investment as well as some employment generation in both Chad and Cameroon (3,000 to 4,500 Chadians and Cameroonians are expected to be hired during the construction phase, and approximately 350-400 Chadians and Cameroonians during the operations phase). Positive spillover effects in the region will also occur from project spending. In addition, the project would contribute to strengthening the environmental ministries in both countries through the development and implementation of extensive environmental and social mitigation plans. This would be further supported by proposed IBRD parallel capacity building projects.	IFC will fulfill three key roles through its proposed investment. Firstly, IFC will play a catalytic role in mobilizing long-term finance that would otherwise be unavailable given the project-specific political risk engendered by the cross-border nature of the pipeline and other perceived political risks in each country. The project represents the first syndicated financing for Chad, and if implemented, the first bond financing in the international markets for both countries. Secondly, IFC and the IBRD will help to ensure stability of the projects arrangements and operation, and will play a critical role in a project involving cooperation between two governments and international oil companies. In such an environment, IFC, as well as the IBRD, can help to ensure confidence in the basic commercial and technical soundness of the project and reduce impact as various agreements are tested in practice. Thirdly, the joint IFC/IBRD involvement has already resulted in raising the standard and quality of the environmental assessments and mitigation plans, including significant adjustments to project design to avoid environmentally sensitive areas in Cameroon. The World Bank Group, through an integrated IFC/IBRD approach, is ensuring that the project is in compliance with all applicable World Bank Group environmental and social policies and guidelines, and will carefully monitor the implementation of the Environmental Management Plans.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category A project according to the Bank and IFC Environmental and Social Review Procedures. Environmental and social issues associated with the project include, but are not limited to: direct (including resettlement) and induced social impacts related to the development of the three oil fields in the Doba Basin; alternative analysis of candidate pipeline corridors and pipeline alignment within the preferred corridor; compensation for socioeconomic impacts in the three oil fields and along the selected pipeline alignment; avoidance, mitigation and compensation of impacts to biodiversity; a plan for the mitigation of impacts to the Bakola population in the Republic of Cameroon, oil spill prevention and response planning; and worker and public health and safety. To identify and predict impacts relating to these and other issues separate Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) were prepared for the Chad and Cameroon portions of the project. On the basis of these EIAs, environmental management plans (EMPs) have been prepared for the respective countries. IBRD and IFC have worked closely to ensure that the respective governments and private sponsors will implement the EMPs in a timely and prudent fashion.	A Regional Development Plan has been prepared by the Government of Chad for the Doba oilfield area that focuses on land and resource management and the mitigation of induced migration to the area. The private sponsors will complement this plan through measures designed to prevent/reduce and monitor induced impacts. A Chad Resettlement and Compensation Plan is in place for households affected by the project.  It is estimated that less than 150 households will need to be moved.  Likely project impacts and compensation arrangements were extensively and thoroughly discussed with people in the area. Many have opted for compensation in kind (such as ox-ploughs and donkey carts). A very high percentage of those who opted for cash compensation have re-invested in agriculture or livestock.	Alternative corridors have been assessed for the pipeline and alignment of the pipeline within the preferred corridor has been optimized from cost, technical, safety, environment and social perspectives. A plan for archaeological finds is in place while pipeline construction and oil field development activities will minimize impacts to sacred sites. In addition to aligning the pipeline to follow existing infrastructure and/or traverse degraded land, biodiversity impact mitigation includes two offsite environmental enhancement programs - one for the semi-deciduous forest and one for the Atlantic Littoral forest.	Resettlement is not expected in Cameroon. However, very limited resettlement is possible with respect to ancillary infrastructure (mainly roads). In the event that resettlement does arise, the private sponsors will comply with OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement.  Extensive and frequent public consultation has taken place on the subject of likely project impacts and compensation measures. Compensation rates for all crops, trees, and other assets have been well researched and discussed with both affected people and all categories of land tenure. The private sponsors will pay compensation at real market values, which are over and above government schedules.       Bakola forest people and Bantu farmers inhabit the pipeline corridor/alignment through the Atlantic Littoral forest. Although impacts on this Bakola population are transitory, the private sponsors have provided funds, guaranteed through a foundation for a twenty-eight year period, for an Indigenous Peoples Plan which supports health, education, and economic development projects for this marginalized ethnic group.	While the project has been designed to avoid oil spill risks, a General Oil Spill Response Plan has been prepared. This plan is in accordance with guidelines from the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association, generally acknowled","","","","","","","","","","","","","",100.0 million (USD)Product LineIFC Investment (million USD)Risk ManagementGuaranteeLoan100.0Equity* These investment figures are indicative,"","","","","","",4338,"",AB - Oil and Gas Production (Includes Development),"","","",""

Ltd.Technical Partner and/or Major ShareholdersThe sponsor of the project is Swazi Wattle Industries (Pty.) Ltd., a company based in Matshapa, Swaziland. Swazi Wattle Industries (Pty.) Ltd. is owned 33.3% by Gerhard Heiser, the marketing director, 33.3% by Percy Elston, the operations director, and 33.3% by Moosa Yousaf, a non-executive directorProject Cost Including proposed IFC investment:The total project cost is R20.0 million (US$3.23 million equivalent), which is an expansion of the existing business. IFC proposes an investment of R2.0 million (US$0.33 million equivalent) in equity and R5.5 million (US$ 0.89 million equivalent) in a venture loan.	Location of project and Description of site:The project will be located at Nhlangano, in the southern part of the Kingdom of Swaziland. Description of Company and Purpose of Project:The project involves the establishment of a new plant to process Mimosa tannin extract powder from the bark of wattle trees. Mimosa is sold on the export market to tanneries worldwide. The new plant will increase the production capacity of Swazi Wattle Industries from 2,000 tons per annum to 12,000 tons per annum.The plant will provide a means for processing wattle bark, which is normally regarded as a waste product. The project has the potential to act as a catalyst to develop the wattle farming industry in Swaziland, particularly those lands farmed by rural farmers. The project will also generate foreign currency revenue for Swaziland as the product is exported. 	The IFC is playing a development role in the project by providing equity and venture loan finance to establish the new plant.	Environmental Category and Issues:This is a Category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure.  The key environmental health and safety issues that were analyzed include source and sustainability of raw material (bark) for processing, including any Government plans to expand black wattle plantations; source of water and power supply, including fuel storage if applicable; air emissions; workplace air quality; recycling, treatment and disposal of solid wastes; recycling, treatment and disposal of liquid processing wastes and sewage; handling and storage of potentially hazardous materials; employee exposure to dust, heat, noise and hazardous materials; compliance with IFC policy on harmful child labor, as well as national labor standards and regulations; provision of personal protective equipment and health and safety training for employees; fire protection and emergency response;  and general plant safety and housekeeping.  IFC has reviewed environmental information supplied by Swazi Wattle, as well as the findings of a recent report prepared by Danish Cooperation for Environment and Development (DANCED) for the Swazi Ministry of Environment and Energy on Forest Policy and Legislation (November 1997); and a 1990 report by the German organization Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit''s (GTZ) Forest Inventory and Planning Project in Swaziland.

IPC has consulted for or managed microfinance operations in Albania, Bolivia, Bosnia, Columbia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Haiti, Paraguay, Russia, Ukraine and Uganda.  IFC has a global relationship with IPC, and is currently working with IPC in Bosnia, Georgia, Haiti and Ukraine, in addition to the proposed MEC transaction in Moldova.IPC-managed microfinance programs have recorded a solid record of success in reaching large numbers of micro and small enterprise (MSE) borrowers, in loan portfolio quality, and in building sustainable institutions.IMI was established by IPC in 1998, to provide an investment vehicle for IPC-managed microfinance ventures in developing and transition economies.  IMI presently has committed capital of DM12.0 million and has invested in seven microfinance institutions, including Micro Enterprise Credit (MEC) in Moldova.IMI has invited IFC, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW), and the Western NIS Enterprise Fund (Western NIS) to be shareholders in MEC Moldova.  Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	It is proposed that IFC make an equity investment of up to US$1.0 million equivalent, representing up to a 20% ownership stake, in Micro Enterprise Credit of Moldova S.A., and provide US$400,000 in grant funds for project development and technical assistance.Location of project and Description of site	MEC has one office located in central Chisinau, the capital and principal city of Moldova.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The project is to establish and operate a specialized financial institution, under applicable Moldovan law, which will provide credit and related services to private micro and small enterprises on a commercial basis.  A range of loan sizes between approximately US$1,000 and US$20,000 will be offered to micro and small entrepreneurs and enterprises (MSEs).	The large urban population of market stall, retail traders and small service-sector proprietorships in metropolitan Chisinau present an extensive prospective client base for MEC.  Best estimates of the current potential market are about 15,000-20,000 individuals and businesses.  Chisinaus small traders have rapidly filled market niches left by Moldovas underdeveloped transport system, weak distribution networks and lack of high-volume retail outlets, such as hypermarkets. MSEs in Moldova, however, cannot access financing from the countrys young and weakly-capitalized commercial banks.  Banks in Moldova historically have had little interest in extending credit to the MSE sector and lack the institutional strength to become active in microfinance.  MSE sector lending is considered high risk  because MSEs usually cannot provide ""bankable"" collateral and generally lack credit history  and expensive, because of the high transaction costs associated with making small MSE loans.  Furthermore, in the wake of the Russian financial crisis and the devaluation of the Lei, the risk aversion of Moldovan banks has become even more pronounced.  Current collateral requirements and credit pricing are beyond the reach of most MSEs.  Lacking a commercial stimulus to diversify into MSE lending, and faced with very limited funds to deploy, Moldovan banks have ignored or withdrawn from this segment of the economy.  MEC is intended to reach this market segment efficiently and fill the gap by providing microcredit on a commercial basis. 	IFC initiated the project in 1999 as the result of a promotion mission to Moldova and has taken the lead in developing this transaction, including identifying financial investors, negotiating project structure, obtaining donor support for technical assistance and liason with the Moldovan government.Environmental Category and Issues	MEC is a Financial Intermediary (FI) Type I project, according to IFCs environmental and social review procedure.  The project technical partner/sponsor IPC/IMI has committed to developing an environmental management framework, to ensure that MEC will have procedures in place to ensure environmental screening, review, and supervision consistent with IFCs requirements for microfinance investments.  In addition, disbursement of IFC''s proposed investment in MEC will be contingent on IFCs Environmental Department determination that appropriate arrangements have been made with respect to environmental management and training, including: (i) establishment of MEC environmental guidelines for microlending; (ii) designation of senior MEC staff with line responsibility for environmental review and reporting; (iii) development of environmental awareness education materials for MEC clients; and (iv) attendance by selected MEC staff at Environment and Social Review training, sponsored by IFC 	Date SPI sent to InfoShop March 21, 2000This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

The fund will invest in Thai companies and financial institutions that are in need of financial restructuring. The fund is a response to the crisis that has hampered Thailand since 1997, which has created a massive need for additional equity capital to de-leverage the corporate sector. While the Thai economy has registered a positive growth last year, sustained recovery of the economy is to a large extent dependent upon further impetus to corporate restructuring.IFC has played a key role in structuring and mobilizing investments in the Fund.

S.A.,"Gbl Ind, Manufact, Agribus & Services",2000-03-28T05:00:00Z,"",B,Loan,"- Technical Partner and/or Major ShareholdersPeru OEH S.A. (POEH) is a 50:50 joint venture between Peru Hotels S.A., a subsidiary of Peru Real Estate S.A. (itself a subsidiary of Peruval, an investment and financial services group), which is also involved in a few other hotel projects in Peru; and Orient Express Hotels Ltd. (OEH), an operator of luxury boutique hotels throughout the world as well as trains and cruises.  Orient Express is, in turn, owned by Sea Containers Ltd.  Peru Hotels S.A. operates prestigious hotels formerly belonging to a government agency, ENTUR PERU, purchased during the public bidding of state-owned companies.  Peru Real Estate S.A. owns 60% of Peru Hotel S.A.  In addition to its hotel operations, this company owns 60% of Peru Desarrollo Inmobiliario.  This is a subsidiary focusing on the master development of vacational homes in Limas coastline.  It also develops shopping malls and high-scale housing buildings.  The companys shares are listed on the Lima Stock Exchange and, at the same time, the company has a Level I ADR program in the over-the-counter market in New York.  Peruval is a company that provides securities intermediation, stock market and economic research, corporate finance, securities placement and distribution services, project finance and new companies start-ups, as well as other financial services.  OEH is an international provider of services for the tourism industry, with a portfolio that includes 18 hotels, 4 luxury trains and a cruiseship in the Far East.  OEH acquired its first property, the Hotel Cipriani in Venice in 1976.  Today, the company operates 18 deluxe hotels in four continents.  These hotel properties share outstanding historic and architectural characteristics.  The company also invested outside of the hotel industry by acquiring the Venice-SimplonOrient Express train in 1982.  Today it owns 4 luxury trains and a cruise ship in the Far East.  OEH  is a subsidiary of Sea Containers Ltd., a corporation with $2.5 billion in assets, and sales of over $1.3 billion during 1999.- Project Cost Including proposed IFC investmentThe total project cost is estimated at $22.5 million.  IFC is considering an investment comprised of an A Loan of up to $6 million and a C Loan of $4 million.      - Location of project and Description of siteThe proposed project includes:- Refurbishing an existing 3-star 32 room Machu Picchu Sanctuary Lodge in Machu Picchu;- Refurbishing an existing 123-room, 5-star Monasterio Hotel in Cusco;- Converting a building adjacent to the Monasterio Hotel (las Nazarenas Convent) to a 58 suite, 5-star hotel;- the purchase and installation of the furniture, fixtures, and equipment (FF&E);- the purchase and installation of required environmental and fire and safety features; and- the allocation of funds for pre-opening costs, interest during construction, working capital, and contingency 	costs.     - Description of Company and Purpose of ProjectConceptually the project makes sense for the type of tourism attracted to this area: cultural enthusiasts and others interested in seeing the ruins of Machu Picchu and the city of Cusco.  Orient Express Hotels is an excellent operator fit.  The challenge is to raise the standards of the physical product and service quality and adjust the marketing strategy to such an extent that room rates and revenues are sufficiently enhanced to justify the additional investment.  IFC''s involvement in the proposed project will provide long-term financing necessary for projects of this type, at a reasonable cost.  Funding with long-term maturities necessary for hotel/real estate projects is currently unavailable in Peru.  In addition, IFC''s Environmental Unit will assist the company with its substantial environmental and cultural heritage obligations.  The proposed hotel development is expected to contribute to Peru''s tourism infrastructure by providing international standard accommodations and food and beverage to an increasing amount of visitors in the area.  The project is expected to generate an additional 200 jobs directly, and also substantial indirect employment though the broader multiplier effects of the investment on the regional economy, with other sectors of the economy such as restaurants, agriculture and tour guiding benefiting from this.  Tax revenues for the government will also increase.  Additionally, the company will upgrade its human capital by imparting professional training to its employees as well as the latest management techniques used by Orient Express in its world renowned hotels.  IFC''s investment is expected to consolidate the privatization process in Peru, set physical standards for future hotel investments and increase foreign exchange earnings.  In addition, the fact that this project is restoring a historic monument (Nazarenas Convent) is an important part of the project.       - Environmental Category and IssuesThis is a Category B project.  The following potential environmental, health and safety, and social impacts of the project were analyzed: - impacts on cultural heritage; - land acquisition process and arrangements; - liquid effluent treatment and solid waste disposal;- handling of hazardous waste; fire protection and life safety;- health and safety; and environmental management systems.For all sites, Peru OEH will have permits from the Insituto Nacional de Cultura (INC) before starting refurbishment or construction.  The INC is the government agency responsible for the protection and management of cultural properties.  This satisfies the objectives and procedures of the IFCs policy on cultural properties.  UNESCO is concerned about the Machu Picchu Historical Sanctuary because of growing visitor numbers and associated development.  UNESCOs World Heritage Center recently reviewed the status of the Machu Picchu Sanctuary Hotel Lodge. Both the company and IFC informed the World Heritage Center of the planned refurbishment.The sponsor will install a new effluent treatment system at the Machu Picchu Sanctuary Lodge to meet IFC standards.  Effluent at the Monasterio and the new Nazarenas hotels will be treated by the Cusco wastewater treatment system.  The Cusco municipality can accept and treat the effluent, as it can solid and construction waste from all three projects.Corrective Action Plans developed by the fire safety engineer to bring the Monasterio and Machu Picchu properties into compliance with IFC fire and life safety guidelines will have been accepted and scheduled by the company prior to first disbursement; furthermore, Peru OEH agrees to follow the engineer''s recommendations for fire and life safety on the Nazarenas property.  All buildings will meet Peruvian standards for earthquake risk.IFC concludes that the proposed project will meet the applicable World Bank Group environmental and social policies and the environmental, health and safety guidelines upon successful implementation of the measures listed in the Environmental and Social Action Plans.The is from the InfoShop.Host country location of environmental documents1) Cusco: Biblioteca Municipal de la ciudad del Cusco.

The A&K Group is controlled by Mr. & Mrs. Jeff Kent, US citizens.  The Kent''s have built-up A&K into a leading tourism company in Africa and other continents.  A&K Botswana is part of an A&K South Africa group with its management centre in Johannesburg.  IFC has made two loans so far to A&K in Southern Africa and we are impressed by the way the operations are conducted.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The total project cost is US$4,059.000.  IFC proposes to lend US$1,970,000.Location of project and Description of site	The 15-acre site is located at Kasane, adjacent to Chobe National Park.Description of Company and Purpose of Project	A&K (Botswana) was set-up in 1998 to run the A&K Group operations in that country.  It first built Chief''s Lodge in the Moremi Game Reserve, which is at the heart of the Okavango Delta.  This lodge opened in September 1999 and has, so far, reached an occupancy level of 48%.  Its clients are drawn from the upper end of the Safari market.  The new Chilwero Lodge is located much closer to Victoria Falls and will mainly draw on that market. There is good road access between Chobe and Victoria Falls.  Chilwero Lodge will therefore provide a safari experience in Chobe without the need for private air charter into the Delta.  This appeals to a slightly different market and widens the scope of A&K operations in Botswana.	Chilwero was an old, 16-bed lodge which A&K took-over in 1998.  The old lodge has now been demolished and A&K is about to start building the new structure.  The footprint of the new lodge is similar to the old one except for the addition of eight, two-bed chalets.  The style of the new lodge is more luxurious and it will be much more suited to today''s markets.	Tourism is the most important industry in northern Botswana and the expansion of the lodge will help attract increased numbers of visitors as well as provide more employment opportunities for local people and rental income for the local land board, which uses the revenue to improve facilities in the area.  While Botswana is a middle income developing country, it is striving to foster tourism in an effort to reduce dependence on diamond production.  By supporting the development IFC is providing long-term project finance which is not readily available across the board.Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure.  Key environmental, health and safety issues of potential concern in this project include site selection criteria; compliance with all relevant laws and regulations of the Botswana Department of Wildlife and National parks; source of water and power including fuel storage, if applicable, recycling and disposal of solid wastes; disposal of liquids wastes, including grease, waste oils and sewage; impact of construction and operation on the riverine ecosystem, including access of local wildlife populations to the Chobe rivers;  impacts on the surrounding area of auxiliary recreation activities such as game viewing and other activities; impacts on vegetation and wildlife of infrastructure including game trails, roads, staff housing and air strip, if applicable; impacts on local communities; public consultation with interested or affected parties;  health and safety issues pertaining to game walks, boating and  recreation activities;  use of CFC-free storage; employee training, health and safety; and fire safety and emergency response measures.  The sponsor has confirmed that the rebuilt lodge and ancillary facilities will be situated within the development site of the existing lodge.

SJV is owned (97.5%) by First International Oil Corporation (FIOC), of the United States and (2.5%) by Atryraumunaigasgeologia (AMG) of Kazakhstan.  FIOC is an independent exploration and development company organized in 1996 for the purpose of exploring and developing hydrocarbon deposits in the Caspian region of Central Asia.  AMG is a previously state-owned drilling company that was privatized in 1996.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Project cost is estimated at US$40 million.  The proposed IFC investment consists of an up to $US12 million loan to SJV and a US$8 million equity investment in FIOC.      Location of project and Description of site     The project involves the expansion of the Sazankurak oilfield in western Kazakhstan.  The Sazankurak field is located 154 kilometers west of the city of Atyrau on the northern edge of the Caspian Sea within the Pre-Caspian Basin.  The field encompasses 500 hectares and is located in a very isolated area with no surrounding industry.  The nearest population center is approximately 20 kilometers to the west.     Description of Company and Purpose of Project    The project involves the expansion of the Sazankurak oilfield in western Kazakhstan.  Existing facilities for the field include a base camp, 2 collecting stations, 2 storage tanks and a rail-loading terminal.IFC financing would play an important role in providing a needed source of long-term finance for projects in Kazakhstan.  Due to concerns about the country''s political risks, and access to export markets, the international financial institutions have been reluctant to meet this need.  IFC financing of this project would represent a needed alternative that would not otherwise be available.  In addition, IFCs participation in this first project would support the countrys effort to develop its oil sector and would signal that there is opportunity for smaller, independent companies to participate in its growth. The project would generate foreign currency and taxes for Kazakhstan, create local employment in a remote area of Kazakhstan, and provide funding for training and social programs.  Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedure.  Key issues reviewed included: air emissions; noise from drilling and operations; water supply and disposal; contamination of the proposed site from current or past operations, on or offsite; occupational health and safety issues including fire protection, emergency response, and control of employee exposure to noise and dust; liquid and solid waste disposal; and resettlement of people or economic dislocation caused by land acquisition for the project.

Other major shareholders are domestic financial institutions (30%) and the public (34%).Over the years, the Taneja Group has expanded in seamless tubes, backward integrated into specialty steel rounds/ billets (the primary input for seamless tube operations) and diversified into financial services and aircraft manufacturing.  As of March 1998, the Group had a total turnover of INR4,500 million (US$104 million).Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	The total cost of the project is estimated at US$ 27.5 million.  IFC is expected to invest US$ 11.5 million by way of debt and equity/quasi-equity. Location of project and Description of site	ISMT is headquartered at Pune in the state of Maharashtra.  Its manufacturing operations are at Ahmednagar in Maharashtra, at a distance of about 75 miles from Pune.  The Kalyani Seamless Tubes Limited (KSTL) plant, which ISMT is proposing to acquire, is located at Baramati in Maharashtra. Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The project involves the modernization, expansion and financial restructuring of Indian Seamless Metal Tubes Limited, the flagship company of the Indian Seamless/B.R. Taneja Group. ISMT, incorporated in 1979, manufactures seamless tubes and pipes in India and has an installed capacity of 50,000 tonnes per annum (tpa).  In order to become a globally competitive player, ISMT plans to acquire additional manufacturing capacity and implement a capex plan of US$ 8 million aimed at modernization and rationalization of its existing capacity. The post-capex/post-rationalization capacity of ISMT will be 55,000 tpa. Further, ISMT has planned to acquire additional capacity through a merger with KSTL, a seamless tubes manufacturing company with an annual capacity of 90,000 tonnes. The merger, funded through an equity swap, will give ISMT additional capacity in the higher value added bearing and cold pilger tubes category, an entry into the Oil Country Tubular Goods (OCTG) segment and a final annual capacity of 155,000 tonnes. 	The proposed project would help achieve restructuring of 60% capacity (combined ISMT and KSTL capacity) of the Indian seamless tubes industry and will result in consolidation of manufacturing capacity under a more experienced and capable management. The project will save the KSTL plant from shutting down (the current management of KSTL being inclined to exit from the seamless tubes industry) and thereby save jobs and productive assets. IFCs support to ISMT would help a small but growing domestic seamless tubes company to become globally competitive in terms of size and efficiency.IFC''s long term funding comprising debt and equity will help a merged company restructure its balance sheet to better withstand the stresses of the post merger period. With domestic financial institutions not in a position to fully fund the company''s restructuring and expansion and with promoters not in a position to provide new equity at the present juncture, IFC''s financial participation in the project becomes critical in meeting the funding gap. Additionally IFC is expected to provide the company guidance in implementing a higher degree of compliance with environmental, social and safety issues.Environmental Category and Issues	This project is a Category B project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedures.  Main potential issues related to this project include: direct and fugitive air emissions, liquid effluent treatment and discharge; solid waste handling and disposal; emergency planning and response; employee exposure to dust, molten metal, and noise; and employee training.  The sponsor will be required to implement the necessary measures to ensure compliance with World Bank guidelines and policies.

The Global Microfinance Capacity Building Facility (the Facility) is based on a global strategic partnership between IFC and IPC, and will include an investment by IFC in IMI, a company established by IPC to make equity investments in for-profit microfinance institutions in emerging markets.  In addition to IPC, IMI''s current shareholders include: (i) IPC Invest, a group of private investors who are either current or former members of IPC''s professional staff; (ii) Deutsche Investitions -und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH (DEG), a government finance and consulting corporation for German development policy; (iii) Pro Credito, a Bolivian foundation; and (iv) the DOEN Foundation, funded from the Netherlands National Postal Lottery.	Microfinance companies to be established under the Facility will have varying shareholder structures.  It is expected, however, that the following multilateral and bilateral institutions will be potential shareholders in selected projects under the Facility: (i) the DOEN Foundation; (ii) EBRD; (iii) DEG; and (iv) Nederlandse Financierungs Maatschappij Voor Ontwikkelingslanden (FMO, a Dutch semi-government owned development financing agency).Project Cost Including proposed IFC investmentThe proposed project, Global Microfinance Capacity Building Facility, consists of IFC investments of up to US$13.4 million, and IFC trust funds for co-financing technical assistance of up to US$1.4 million, for the creation of microfinance institutions in selected member developing countries over a three-year period.  The proposed package encompasses a strategic investment of DM4.0 million (US$2.0 million) in the equity capital of Internationale Micro Investitionen (IMI), a German investment firm dedicated to acquiring equity participations in microfinance institutions in emerging markets.	The overall cost of the Facility (US$85.0 million) includes an equity component (US$51.7 million) and a component of grant funds for technical assistance (US$20.0 million).  IFC''s equity investment (US$13.4 million) would represent around 20% of the total equity financing and 7.0% (US$1.4 million) of the total trust funds component. International institutional investors, including multilateral and bilateral financial institutions, donors and foundations would be approached to fund the remaining 80% equity investment (US$ 51.7 million) and 93% grant funds (US$18.6 million).	Location of project and Description of siteThe Facility has identified the following countries for the creation of commercially oriented microfinance institutions over a three-year period:  Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Macedonia, Moldova, Romania, southeastern Turkey, Kazakhstan, Ghana, Peru and the Philippines as well as Kosovo Description of Company and Purpose of ProjectsThe rationale of the project is to promote micro lending institutions in member developing countries to help populations with little or no access to formal credit institutions transition from unemployment to economic growth and employment generation through participation in the market economy.  The proposed Facility is the first step in a planned series of global and regional initiatives planned to promote the development of commercially sustainable credit and other financial services for micro and small enterprises.  Other global and regional initiatives will rely on a series of strategic partnerships between IFC and other technical partners to expand the investment and human capital available to pioneer and replicate successful models of delivering credit and other financial services to micro and small businesses with limited access to the formal financial system.This multi-project program is expected to provide a basis for a more efficient and strategic approach to augmenting the supply of credit and other financial services to micro and small enterprises.  By creating strategic alliances for fund raising, management support services, and strengthening capacity for standardized project documentation and project processing procedures, the cost of putting very small micro-finance investments on the books can be significantly reduced.  A mid-term planning horizon will also let the technical partner, IPC, start building its capacity to accommodate the increased level of activities associated with creating eleven microfinance institutions over a short period of three years.	The developmental impact of commercially-run microfinance institutions, particularly on populations with little or no access to formal credit institutions, has been well demonstrated by IFC''s model microfinance institution, Micro Enterprise Bank, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and by the internationally-recognized microfinance institutions such as Bank Rakyat Indonesia and Bancosol.  IFC''s developmental strategy for the sector is to attract significant private sector investment in microfinance by demonstrating that properly structured and organized microfinance institutions can be a viable commercial proposition.A key objective of the Facility is to generate a significant international demonstration effect to catalyze the replication of the IFC model microfinance institutions in emerging markets.  Following its successful implementation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (MEB), the IFC ""model"" microfinance institution has been replicated in Albania, Georgia, Haiti, and Kosovo.  By demonstrating the commercial viability of micro-lending institutions and the anticipated replication of the model in emerging markets, IFC''s microfinance strategy aims to catalyze private investment in the micro and small enterprise sector.Environmental Category and IssuesThis is a category FI Type 1 project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedure.  IPC/IMI have agreed to develop an environmental management framework to ensure that each financial institution in which IMI invests will have an environmental management system (EMS).  The EMS for each institution will provide that activities financed must comply with the applicable environmental, health and safety legislation and standards of the host country and be consistent with IFCs Microfinance Exclusion List. IPC has agreed to appoint a person in a management role to act as IMIs environmental advisor.  IPC has agreed to provide to IFC an annual environmental performance report on IMI investments, which will be a consolidated report on environmental management and will be based on the environmental performance reports provided to IMI by the investee companies.Date SPI sent to InfoShop April 14, 2000This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

Dr. Zekpa and Dr. Dressen together control 57% of SIMMEQ. None of the other 10 shareholders own more than 11% of SIMMEQ. Dr. Zekpa is an Ivorian doctor who qualified in medecine in Abidjan and did several specialization internships in Bordeaux, Paris and Marseille. He worked in public and private hospitals in Abidjan as an anaesthetist/intensive care specialist for over 20 years. Dr Zepka is a person of great energy and determination.   Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Total project cost is estimated at US$3.35 million equivalent.  IFC has been asked to provide a Euro loan of US$1.1 million equivalent representing 33% of total project cost. Location of project and Description of site	The project is located on a 6,975 square meter plot of land in zone 4, a neighborhood of southern Abidjan. The hospital is a four-floor building on a reinforced concrete frame. Each floor is 1,500 square meters giving a total floor area of 6,000 square meters.Description of Company and Purpose of ProjectThe project involves the construction and operation of a 79 bed private hospital in Abidjan, the capital city of Côte d''ivoire.	The hospital, Polyclinique Les Graces (PLG), will contain most of the major specialties and offer comprehensive and integrated medical care under one roof. With its 79 beds, PLG will be the second-largest private hospital facility in Abidjan.      PLG will provide outpatient services and inpatient services. The hospital has 71 ordinary beds in one or two-bedded rooms, 4 intensive care beds and 4 observation beds. The main specialties being covered include obstetrics and gynecology, general surgery, general medicine, pediatrics with specialist neonatal care, orthopedic surgery, ear, nose and throat surgery, urology and nephrology, gastroenterology, cardiology and oncology.  Radiology will be contracted to a specialist company operating at the PLG premises. Laboratory work is to be contracted out to the Laboratoire Principal in the Plateau district of Abidjan. More professional management is needed in the Abidjan private health care sector. There is a great need for more efficiency so that prices can be lowered and medical cover extended to more people at reasonable cost. Containing cost-escalation while enlarging access to quality care will impact very positively on the overall health system and set an important precedent. This will allow PLG to provide quality services to a larger share of a growing insured population.    PLG has learnt from past mistakes in the sector, addressed weaknesses and invested in high quality specialized services where it has determined having comparative advantages. The objective is to systematically research increased efficiency. The proposed investments in the establishment of PLG will contribute to elevate standards and achieve efficiency and productivity gains through rationalization of operations and the use of innovative technology for diagnostic and management, therefore presenting a very positive development impact for the entire health sector. PLG will contribute to setting the standard for future investment in the sector.  Through its involvement during project finalization and in making possible its implementation, IFC has and will bring a valuable contribution to achieve the development impact presented above.First, IFC will provide PLG access to long-term financing otherwise unavailable to the Ivorian private health care sector. Many creditors continue to consider the health sector as being characterized by high risk and low profitability, mainly because of its specificity and the resultant lack of understanding of the industry. The presence of IFC in the financial plan of this project has provided comfort to BICICI, the local bank which is co-financing this venture. IFC support comes at a critical time.  IFC will also contribute to the establishment of a modern, efficiently run private clinic thereby helping PLG enhance market discipline and consolidate its competitive edge.  Through the investment program, PLG will pursue the professionalization of its management up to international standards.  Through its due diligence process, IFC has made an important contribution to finalize the management arrangements for the Hospital.  As IFC support to PLG proves to be successful, IFC will have also contributed to establishing a new environment for the private health sector activities in Côte d''Ivoire. This will constitute an important demonstration effect regarding the practicability, profitability, and developmental value of investments in private health care.Finally, the project is an additional example of IFCs global strategy to target the human infrastructure (health, education, services) sectors.   	The project fits with the World Bank Group strategy to improve healthcare services in Côte d''Ivoire as part of the Group''s overall plan to enhance human development and social services. It is consistent with IFC''s policy to support private sector participation in the healthcare sector.   Environmental Category and Issues	This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure. Environmental, health and safety issues include: site location, power and water supply, waste management, handling and storing of chemical and pharmaceutical products, CFC-free equipment, fire protection, work place health and safety issues including exposure to X rays radiations.""The Simmeq clinic is located in a residential area of Abidjan. All medical product will be carefully stored in rooms with restricted and controlled access. Biomedical and hazardous waste is to be incinerated on site as there is no adequate waste treatment facilities in Abidjan while radiographic films will be collected and recycled through a specialized Europe-based NGO. Liquid effluents are to be treated via septic tanks.Health and safety issues, including XR protection and regular training of employees is to be addressed in a safety plan.Based on its review of available information regarding potential environmental impacts and the measures described above, IFC concludes that the proposed project will be in compliance  with World Bank Group and  IFC policies and with World Bank Group environmental, health and safety guidelines in force at the time of appraisal.IFC will monitor ongoing compliance during the life of the project by evaluating monitoring reports submitted annually to IFC by the sponsor and by conducting periodic site reviews during project supervision.Local release of the ERS will be announced in French in the local newspaper, the Fraternité Matin.The  is  from the InfoShop.Host country location of environmental documentsAt the entrance of Polyclinique Les GracesRue Marconyilot 4 et 5, Bietry Zone 4 CAbidjanCôte d''IvoireDate SPI sent to InfoShop April 19, 2000This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

Honeos S.A. is a medium sized family owned Greek company with over 40 years of experience in the fruit and soft drinks industry.      - Project Cost Including proposed IFC investmentTotal project cost is estimated at $12.9 million. The IFC loan of $3.6 million will finance 28% of the investment.Location of project and Description of siteThe facility is located on a 37,000 m² site located in a light industrial neighborhood on the outskirts of Sofia.       - Description of Company and Purpose of Project	The project will support the establishment of an integrated fruit juice and carbonated drinks company in Bulgaria.  Established originally in 1993 as an importer of high quality juices from its Greek partner Florina-A. Honeos, Florina Bulgaria S.A. (Florina) is today Bulgaria''s third fruit juice producer by size and the local market leader for premium quality juices with its existing strong brand name and extensive distribution network.    In order to take advantage of a steadily growing fruit drink market, Florina Bulgaria S.A. started the project by acquiring a redundant bread factory in 1998, through privatization, and converting it into a juice packing plant equipped with a Tetra Pak juice filling line operational as of mid-1999. In a second phase, Florina Bulgaria S.A. will integrate peach and apricot purees production using local fresh fruit, and create a soft drink production line in order to achieve economies of scale and optimize assets utilization. The project will also involve an orchard development program with expected support from IFC/Greek Trust Funds, and financing of additional delivery vans and working capital needs.  Given that Bulgaria remains a difficult environment for foreign direct investment, IFCs participation in the project provides comfort to the sponsor in its first major plant investment outside of Greece.  In addition, IFC will provide Florina Bulgaria S.A. with long-term funding that otherwise would not be available at reasonable terms, and is helping the company mobilize funding to complete the financial plan. IFC has also been instrumental in reviewing with the sponsors the risks and issues in particular related to local raw material supply. As part of the project, IFC will assist Florina Bulgaria S.A. in structuring a technical assistance program for orchard development, in particular, peach and apricot production, to deter the gradually decreasing orchards production in Bulgaria following ten years of agricultural neglect.The project is expected to have strong developmental impact on the Bulgarian agricultural sector and economy. It will help create and maintain about 135 direct and indirect jobs. In addition, it will contribute to the rejuvenation of the fruit sector in Bulgaria by creating a consistent level of demand for local fruits, and encouraging, through an orchard development program, private small farmers to further develop and expand their orchards after many years of neglect.  It also promotes the production of value added products capitalizing on Bulgaria''s traditionally strong fruit production sector, and supports local entrepreneurship as well as technology transfer by importing the latest fruit processing and packaging equipment and training Bulgarian nationals to international standards in quality control, operational, and marketing skills.      - Environmental Category and IssuesThis is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure and the following potential issues were considered during appraisal: potential contamination of the site from past uses, pesticide residues, labor practices, sustainability of water supply, liquid effluent treatment and solid waste disposal, air emissions, use of CFCs in refrigeration systems, fire prevention and emergency response, and general workplace health and safety.The project is located in an industrial area and prior use of the site was for a bakery.  Detailed site and plant investigation has confirmed that there is no risk of prior contamination and the development of the site complies with local and national planning controls and requirements.  The sponsor has established operational procedures that monitor the use of pesticides and the company will develop contracts that specify details of pesticide use and management. Water supply for the plant is sustainable and abstraction from the company''s on site well will not affect others.  The treatment and disposal of waste effluents, solid waste, chemicals and other hazardous materials conforms with WBG requirements. The site has a health unit and on site medical facilities and staff. Additionally, the company is developing an Emergency Response Plan and a fire safety and evacuation plan has been introduced as per Bulgarian legal requirements.Based on its review of available information regarding potential environmental impacts and proposed mitigation measures, IFC concludes that Florina Bulgaria''s proposed project is designed to meet World Bank Group''s environmental, health, and safety policies and guidelines as well as host country requirements.        - The  is  from the InfoShop.Host country location of environmental documentsAt the Company''s factory in Sofia:20 Mann Drinov Str., 1504 Sofia, Bulgaria.Date SPI sent to InfoShop April 19, 2000This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.

In 1988 he left to co-found Intertec Industries Services GmbH, Hamburg supplying industrial spare parts for maintenance and providing logistics services to oil companies in Nigeria and in 1997 he became the Managing Director of Intertec Engineering (Nig) Limited. He is well known in the oil companies, NNPC, PPMC and the finance industry. Mr. Kruttke will be the major shareholder with 39% of the company.	The project has no technical partner.Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment	Total project cost is estimated at US$2.0 million.  IFC has been asked to provide a loan of US$.5 million and equity of US$.04 representing 27% total project cost. 	Location of project and Description of site	The project will be located at Omuolo-Omagwa Village, Ikwerre Local Government Area, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria. The area is close to the Port-Harcourt International airport and well served with essential infrastructural facilities such as electricity, security, access roads, telecommunications, accommodation and medical facilities. Description of Company and Purpose of ProjectSafety Center International Ltd. will be incorporated in Nigeria with the objective to train safety and fire fighting personnel in the use of Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and maintain safety instruments and equipment for oil companies. The project is to set up the first training center in Nigeria at Port Harcourt to train fire brigade and safety personnel on how to use SCBA when operating under fire and other hazardous conditions. This training will certify, standardize and improve the ability of safety and fire operators to rescue victims of fire and other tragic incidence trapped in difficult location. The training center will use Simulation Tunnel (ST) designed and built based on the Training Gallery concept of Drager Sicherheitstechnik GmbH, Germany, a world-wide market leader in the fire protection and safety industry which has experience of building over 200 similar galleries in various parts of the world.

Cementos del Caribe S.A.,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Colombia,"Cementos del Caribe, S.A.",Regional Industry - MAS LAC,2000-04-24T04:00:00Z,"",B,Loan,"Caribe is owned 67.25% (directly and indirectly) by Compania de Cemento Argos, S.A., which in turn is part of the Sindicato Antioqueno of Medellín.  The remaining 32.75% of shares are held by Cementos del Valle (4.75%); Corfinsura (3.72%) and others (24.28%).  Caribe has no technical partners. Caribes ownership in its cement-producing subsidiaries involved in the project is as follows: 71% of Tolcemento, 61% of Colclinker and 98% of Andino (Venezuela).  Project Cost Including Proposed IFC InvestmentThe total project cost is $88.5 million and has three components:- the Tolcemento investment program, amounting to $14 million (16%); - the Andino investment program, amounting to $33.6 million (38%); and - short-term debt refinancing of $40.9 million (46% of total).  IFCs proposed investment amounts to $73 million, including an A Loan of US$15 million for IFCs own account, a B Loan of $48 million for the account of participants; and an IFC equity investment of $10 million.   The remaining funding will be contributed by Caribe.- Location of Project and Description of SiteThe project will be implemented at two locations, namely, Tolcemento, located in Toluviejo in the state of Sucre, Colombia, and Andino, located in Trujillo, Venezuela. Tolcemento is located 26 km from Tolu, one km from the  Sincelejo-Tolu highway.  Founded in 1964, the plant has two dry process lines (1000 tpd and 600 tpd clinker) installed in 1969 and 1986, respectively. Polysius (Germany) supplied the first line, and Fuller (USA) supplied the second line.  The plants capacity is 460,000 tpy clinker and 825,000 tpy cement.  Tolcemento has its own port on the Gulf of Morrosquillo, with a loading capacity of 30,000 tons. Regarding Andino, the nearest highway is Autopista Lara-Zulia, located 75 km from the plant. The plant has one dry process line (1,800 tpd clinker) installed in 1982 and supplied by Polysius. Andino has capacity of 540,000 tpy clinker and 594,000 tpy cement, and its own port in La Ceiba with loading capacity of 4,000 tons.- Description of Company and Purpose of ProjectCaribe, and two of its subsidiaries, Compania Colombiana de Clinker, S.A., (Colclinker) and Cales y Cementos de Toluviejo, S.A. (Tolcemento), are the leading cement producers in the Atlantic Coast Region of Colombia where they have an 84% market share in their natural market. They also represent 100% of Colombias cement exports with a 49-year history of uninterrupted cement and clinker exports.  The plants owned by these three companies have combined annual capacity of 3.7 million tons, which represent around 25% of Colombias total installed capacity.In 1997, the Government of Venezuela awarded Caribe the right to purchase the assets of Andino, formerly the Monay Cement Complex, for $83.5 million.  The rationale for Caribes purchase of Andino included:- a strategic investment which gives Caribe the ability to participate in the Venezuelan market where key Colombian market players also have a presence;- Andinos strategic location which Caribe views as an ideal export platform; and- Venezuelas favorable growth prospects.  The project selectively targets two of Caribes plants: Andino in Venezuela and Tolcemento in Colombia. The objectives of the project involve: - modernization and capacity upgrades for both plants; - a reduction in production costs and bottlenecks;- environmental upgrades; and - the restructuring of short-term debt.  The project will be implemented over 2000-2002.The project focuses on investments required to upgrade and modernize Andino following its privatization at year-end 1997.  In just two years, Caribe has shown an impressive turn-around in Andinos operations.  The project is expected to increase the clinker production capacity of Andino from 540,000 tpy to 750,000 tpy (39% increase) as well as to reduce Andinos energy consumption, improving its production cost structure. Tolcementos clinker capacity utilization has recently been as high as 93% and averaged 79% in 1999. Tolcemento is currently operating at full capacity and is unable to meet its U.S. demand.  The project is expected to increase Tolcementos clinker capacity from 465,000 tpy to 525,000 tpy (13% increase). Capacity upgrades will considerably help reduce fixed costs of both Andino and Tolcemento under favorable market conditions and enhanced capacity utilization.  Also, Tolcementos cash production costs will be reduced through various cost-reduction investments, and Caribe ranks its modernization program for Tolcemento as a key priority.  Caribe financed its acquisition of Andino with a one-year bridge loan which was subsequently rolled-over until December 2001. This loan was incurred on unfavorable terms.  It is intended that the portion of this loan currently on Andinos balance sheet ($40.9 million) be refinanced through a combination of IFC loans and sponsor support.  The deterioration of Colombias status in the international capital markets has virtually eliminated Caribes access to long-term financing to retailor this debt on appropriate terms as it implements its new investment program. In sum, the timing of the proposed project is essential since Caribe can take advantage of the currently favorable cement prices in Colombia and Venezuela to carry out investments which will reduce production costs of Andino and Tolcemento.  These investments will help strengthen the Groups competitiveness in Colombia and Venezuela and position it for further growth abroad. IFCs Role in this transaction involves:- Access to Long-term Financing:  IFC''s long-term financing and equity capital will give Caribe an appropriate tenor and grace period to finance its investment program and combat one of the most severe capital shortages experienced in Colombia in recent years. Given that Caribe is one of few remaining important, independent cement producers in South America, its continued competitiveness in an industry characterized globally by consolidation relies heavily on its continued investment in modernization and production efficiencies and access to competitive sources of investment capital.  IFC plays an important catalytic role in this transaction.  Several of Caribe''s relationship banks have communicated to IFC their interest in supporting Caribe but have stated that they could only do so with the IFC umbrella as part of an IFC B Loan structure.- Support of Recently Privatized Company: IFC will support Andino, which would also be a direct Borrower.  Andino, with 1999 revenues of $38 million equivalent, is a second-tier company by Venezuelan standards. Caribe has been implementing an impressive turnaround of Andinos operations and performance since Andinos privatization in 1997. The project will have a positive development impact in Colombia and Venezuela including:- Support for Colombia:  While Colombia enjoyed an investment grade rating, industrials had reasonably good access to investment capital on adequate terms.  Colombias loss of its investment grade rating, economic recession and political uncertainty, struggles with narco-terrorist activities, and liquidity constraints in the domestic banking sector, have completely reversed this situation and virtually cut off access to term financing for even creditworthy companies like Caribe. IFC will help fill a gap left by the exit of foreign commercial banks from the Colombian term market and allow Caribe to continue with its new investment program and growth objectives.- Support of Independent Cement Producer and Exporter:  The project will support an important Colombian company and one of few remaining local, independent, and competitive cement producers in South America.  The Caribe Group also is responsible for 100% of Colombias cement exports, making it an important earner of foreign exchange for the country. - Andean Pact Region:  By spanning two countries, the project promotes intra-regional commerce and cooperation between Colombia and Venezuela, two Andean Pact countries.  The project will help support the Governments initiatives to promote cross-border business and financial synergies. - Environmental Category and IssuesThis is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.  As part of the Project, Andino will upgrade the existing kiln/raw mill and cooler electrofilters, and the additional sources of dust generation will be operated to ensure compliance. Before disbursement, the Sponsor will present updates to the environmental impact studies prepared for the plant and the port including the mitigation actions that will ensure that the port upgrades will comply with applicable World Bank guidelines.  There will be a reduction in Andinos labor force associated with the Project, and the Sponsor will implement a workers compensation program which will fully comply with Venezuelan regulations.  As part of the project, Tolcemento will upgrade the operations and continue implementing its existing reforestation program at all the quarries and additional measures to prevent solid deposition in the water bodies nearby to ensure compliance with applicable World Bank guidelines.Caribe has developed a corporate-wide environmental policy and will submit outlines of the environmental management programs before first disbursement. By project completion, the operations of both Tolcemento and Andino will comply with the relevant World Bank guidelines and policies; as well as the relevant Colombian and Venezuelan environmental standards, respectively.  The sponsor will submit annually to IFC a monitoring report to demonstrate ongoing environmental compliance during the life of the proj","","","","","","","","","","","","","",14.05 million (USD)Product LineIFC Investment (million USD)Risk ManagementGuaranteeLoan4.05Equity10.0* These investment figures are indicative,"","","","","","",9904,"",AA - Cement,"","","",""

Using a combination of efficient, securitization-driven funding and low overheads, SA Home Loans will offer mortgage rates 2 to 3 percent lower than those currently offered by the large commercial banks, which are the sole source of private sector mortgage finance in South Africa at this time.  The purpose of the project is to provide SA Home Loans with sufficient warehousing capacity  to fund its growing mortgage originations prior to their securitization in the domestic market.  IFC has been asked to be a lead investor in the Warehouse Line, which is being arranged by J.P. Morgan with domestic banks in South Africa. The proposed Warehouse Line is fundamental to the companys ongoing viability.  The project is expected to have a significant developmental impact in a number of areas:  (i) it will improve the feasibility of the securitization of domestic assets in South Africa by allowing the accumulation of an economically efficient sized pool of assets, (ii) it will introduce the concept of  securitization warehouse lending in the local banking market and (iii) by helping a pioneering initiative like SA Home Loans succeed the project will improve competition in the domestic market for housing finance.","","","","","","","","","","",This is a category C project according to IFC''s environmental review procedures and is likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts.

Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Active,Latin America and the Caribbean,Argentina,AGUAS PROVINCIALES DE SANTA FE S.A.,Regional Industry - INF LAC,2000-05-05T04:00:00Z,2000-06-06T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"In August 1995, as a result of an international public tender, Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fé was awarded a 30-year concession to provide potable water and sewerage services to fifteen districts.  The districts are scattered across the province of Santa Fe,  Argentina, and include major cities such as Rosario and the provincial capital Santa Fe.  The company provides potable water to about 1.8 million customers and sewerage services to 1.25 million customers.  The company has to invest in assets in accordance with a detailed plan as set forth by the concession.  The company''s investment program requires total capital outlays of US$150.7 million.  The focus of this plan is on water treatment facilities and supply network expansion (US$65.4 million), waste water collection network, treatment  plants and equipment (US$56.8 million).  Under this plan the company would install about 10,000 new water supply connections and 17,000 new sewer connections, of which the sewer connections have already been mostly completed during 1999.  During 1999 the company completed construction of two wastewater treatment plants and rehabilitation of  others.  Furthermore, the company would improve supply systems in rural areas by drilling additional wells and improving drinking water quality for rural communities.  The plans for future capital works are currently under discussion with the provincial authorities and are subject to change.  IFC will finance this concession since long-term funding, of the tenor that is appropriate to the nature of this project, is currently unavailable in Argentina and in international capital markets.  This is particularly so for a provincial concession that is exposed to full sub-sovereign risk.  In addition, the instability in financial markets brought about by recent events in Brazil and other countries are compounded by uncertainty about Argentinas political future and have led to restricted credit in Argentina.  Finally, the demonstration effect of a successful financing of a provincial concession could prove to be very important in the efforts to privatize and finance smaller utilities worldwide.   The company''s investment program will provide much needed Water & Sanitation infrastructure to the people of Santa Fe, in particular the extension of the supply and sewer networks are important as they are focused on the poorer neighboorhoods and rural towns of Santa Fe.  These areas typically tend to have inhabitants of lesser resources and connecting to water and sanitation services is of prime importance for living conditions (a fact corroborated by public sector projects such as those implemented by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD or the World Bank)  and the Inter-American Dvelopment Bank (IADB).  Also, after many years of minimal investment in the system, the service levels to existing customer''s had deteriorated and the current investments also aim at providing an acceptable service level to those already connected to the system.  For example, it is estimated that around the city of Rosario about 200,000 people live in non-formal housing and a large percentage of them have minimal access to W&S services.  In summary, APSF''s investments will be used to continue connecting new customers and upgrading the service of existing users.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityThe ERS will be disclosed at the following locations in Argentina:Rosario 			San Martín 1106 				San Martín 4379 				Mendoza 3579 				Avellaneda 650 Bis 				Warnes 1917 P.A.

UPC was founded in 1994 as a private, non-profit academic association in the wake of increasing liberalization by the Peruvian government which included initiatives to improve the quality of education.  In June 1999, it became the first educational establishment in Peru to be privately owned and run on a for-profit basis as a Sociedad Anonima, a possibility rarely found in Latin America. UPC has shown impressive  50% p.a. enrollment growth since its inception and today ranks as one of the top five private universities in Lima.  UPC''s consolidated revenues amounted to approximately US$18 million in 1999.In order to accommodate its growing enrollment and enhance its profile and competitive position in the Peruvian higher education market, UPC has embarked on a new investment program to expand, rationalize and modernize its facilities.  IFCs participation will play a critical role in the UPC project in the following areas:Support for a viable private university:  IFC would support a financially viable private university during a critical period of development, given its rapid enrollment growth, its recent merger with Cibertec, and the new dynamics in the higher education market in Peru following regulatory changes which permit private universities to operate on a for-profit basis. With its evolving portfolio of education investments in Latin America, IFC is well placed to support UPC during this period of transition.    Provide long-term financing:  UPCs management attempted to raise financing in local markets in 1998-1999. However, beyond the financial market distress which characterized 1999 and led to a retrenching of commercial banks from term lending, education remains a sector with which financial institutions are poorly acquainted and reluctant to invest.  Two domestic commercial banks contacted, while interested in supporting UPC, eventually declined to provide any long-term funding at any price due to the external crisis and lack of liquidity in Peru.  While UPC funded most of its early growth gradually through internal cash, the funding demands upon UPC have accelerated due to its rapid growth. IFCs involvement will allow UPC to implement its imminently needed capital investment program in a timely way with financing on appropriate terms.IFCs support of UPC would have a development impact in three areas.  First, the project will contribute to enhance the quality and efficiency of the education sector in Peru. Secondly, the project will have an important demonstration effect.  Finally, UPC''s individual impact will be leveraged by its place within the World Banks strategy which seeks a systematic reform of Perus educational system, making the UPC project particularly timely.","","","","","","","","","","","This a category B project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedure because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

Over the years, it has remained well managed and consistently profitable. Mr. Gautam Thapar took over as the Managing Director in 1997 and since then, BILT has embarked upon a comprehensive restructuring aimed at becoming the market leader in the Indian writing and printing market. This restructuring is being implemented in two phases. In the first phase, BILT transformed itself from a conglomerate into a pure paper Company by stripping it of all its unprofitable investments and non-paper businesses, using the cash to retire high cost debt. The second phase of restructuring is at present underway and aims at establishing BILT as the largest integrated writing and printing paper manufacturer in India, with a total paper capacity of 230,000TPA and pulp capacity of 105,000TPA.The Project involves capacity expansion at three of BILT''s paper manufacturing facilities through both, modernization and addition of new equipment. The Project would enhance the Company''s competitive strength by helping it acheive economies of scale and stabilize its capital base through a low debt/equity gearing necessary to ride out the cyclical nature of the cash flows in the sector.The development impact of the Project is in terms of (i) enhancing the long-term viability of companies like BILT that are operating in cyclical industries by lowering their cost of funding and extending the maturity of debt obligations, thus stabilising its cash flows through periods of cyclicality; (ii) promoting social forestry - the Company ecncourages small farmers located close to the plant to grow eucalyptus and casuarina, which are sources of pulp,  by providing them with free saplings and other inputs. These cash-crops provide a stable income stream for the farmers, whose earning s are typically subject to seasonal fluctuation; (iii) the Company is developing innovative value added products to upgrade the market in quality, especially the lower-end segments like Creamwove; (iv) R&D efforts- which have resulted in substantial cost savings for the Company, passed on to the customers,  by improving efficiencies in raw material usage.IFC''s role in this project is two-fold : (i) Extending maturity of debt - Due to the cyclical nature of the paper industry, even strong companies like BILT are unable to source funding greater than 5 years. As a result cash flows are severely strained during a down cycle, leaving little surplus for debt servicing or modernization/expansion. The IFC guarantee will enable BILT to overcome this constraint by extending the maturity of debt available to it locally, by 5 years; (ii) Supporting BILT''s restructuring initiative - The IFC investment will support thr restructuring of a family owned conglomerate into a professionally managed group of individual companies focussed on individual business lines.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityMr. Gautam ThaparManaging DirectorBallarpur Industries Ltd.Thapar House, Janpath, New Delhi 110 001","Ballarpur Industries Ltd.

In addition to growth capital, the fund will provide value addition through guidance for corporate strategy, marketing, professional management, corporate goverance, etc. The AMP-IndAsia Fund will assist such companies to refocus towards the global markets, and will have the opportunity to exit when these companies make fund-guided public offerings. To create an alternative exit strategy, the fund will build networks from companies in the same sector, to capture synergies and create value. The goal is to form synergistic groups attractive to outside buyers from component companies that individually would not attract outside interest. The further liberalizations, in addition to the current economic recovery and recent regulatory reforms for private equity funds, signal an enabling environment which is becoming increasingly favorable to unlisted funds in India. Developmental ImpactPrivate equity funds are unique amongst financial intermediaries in that they have a small portfolio (up to 5 investments per manager) upon which very specialized and focussed attention is lavished by ex-entrepreneurs with considerable industry or strategic experience, as opposed to a very large portfolio which is monitored passively. In other words, these funds add value in numerous areas such as strategy, corporate governance, finance, IT, human resources, and marketing, and therefore play a decisive role in determining the success or the failure of the company in question. Late-stage funds, such as this fund, play an essential role within the panoply of stage-wise funds, as they focus on facilitating exits (preparing for IPOs, obtaining SEBI clearance, market timing, further private placement, etc), whereas earlier-stage funds put their emphasis on start-up issues (developing a business plan, implementation, etc). Funds which have developed an expertise in a particular stage will be able to add much more ""timely"" value to that company than most other financial intermediaries. Without late stage funds, early-stage funds sometimes have difficulty exiting from their investments. In this way, this fund will complement the work currently being done by the earlier-stage funds. Lastly, investing in funds helps to further develop the fund management industry in India, which is now ten years old, but which has considerable ground to cover before reaching the level of professionalism seen today in countries such as the US, UK, etc.IFC RoleIFC is playing several roles in this fund. Firstly, over the past two years, IFC has played a key role in formulating the value addition late-stage investment strategy of the fund, such that the fund will respond to the developmental needs of both the market and the private equity industry. This role is continuing as IFC cooperates with AMP in advising IndAsia Advisors on value addition techniques.  Although there are several private equity funds focussing on India now they are principally looking at the IT sector and consequently the late stage segment is underserved.  Secondly, IFC has already begun to share the lessons learned from its nine existing funds in India with the two sponsors, as IFC has been involved in private equity in India longer than both AMP and IndAsia''s partners. Thirdly, IFC involvement will assist the sponsors with mobilizing third party funding by enhancing the credibility of the fund with other investors, given IFCs experience with structuring and overseeing funds in emerging markets.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Financial Intermediary (FI) Type 2 project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.

As with all NIIT courses, the graduate program is modular, computer-based and off-campus. NIIT is expecting to enrol 50,000 students in GNIIT in the next five years.- Project Rationale:By participating in the GNIIT student loan program, IFC is helping to support not only a highly unique and entrepreneurial model of private sector-led applied IT education for adults, but also the introduction of a new asset class, student loans. This program will show other Indian companies a working model of a student loan system which could be replicated India-wide; IFC could also assist NIIT to replicate the GNIIT student loan program in its other 15 emerging market teaching centres, including Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.  - IFCs Role: In the past, financial institutions in developing countries have avoided investing in students education with the view that it this is either a state, a charitable, or a loss-making sector. IFCs guarantee is helping to launch a new asset class in India: the student loan. IFC by itself could never fill the private education sector ""funding gap"" of a country. But as IFC demonstrates the feasibility of profitably investing in the education sector, it can encourage other financial institutions to become active players rather than remaining on the sidelines. IFC can also play a significant role in spreading this ''model'' student loan program by helping NIIT replicate it worldwide. - Developmental Impact:The GNIIT student loan program will have numerous developmental impacts: - This project extends educational opportunities. It attempts to reach families from many income groups. Equity in access to knowledge, which empowers the disadvantaged, is a key outcome. - It will help to establish resource mobilization (including beneficiary cost-recovery) mechanisms to ensure that sector financing is both equitable and adequate. - It emphasizes innovation, skilled management, motivated and skilled staff, parental satisfaction, and improved performance on standardized tests. It can demonstrate successes for emulation by other schools in the community and reach out to help them. Finally the project contributes to economic growth through enhancing the quality and size of a countrys stock of human capital, its key asset. It can create modern facilities and programs at reasonable cost.","","","","","","","","","","",This is a Category C project according to IFC''s environment and social review procedure.

Tusk takes over the administration of the contracts and obtains performance guarantees. This leaves the contractors, usually small, black-owned businesses, free to concentrate on the construction work. To ensure that the contracts are viable, Tusk evaluates each of the contracts before it enters into agreements with the contractors. Most of the contracts are with local authorities for schools, clinics, low cost houses and other public buildings. The contracts are usually awarded under affirmative action programs which makes the service provided by Tusk very valuable as a support for small contractors who do not have elaborate back-office setups. The services provided by the company therefor have a strong developmental impact. Once Tusk is satisfied that the contracts are viable, it signs management contracts. Its fees are usually in the range of 2% to 4% of the value of the contracts. Tusk then makes working capital loans to the contractors equal to 10% of the value of the contracts. Thereafter, up to completion of the contracts, Tusk monitors the procurement of raw materials, advises on the work and organises the claims for payments. It maintains joint bank accounts with the contractors which provides security for the loans and Tusk''s fees. About two thirds of Tusk''s income comes from project management fees and one third from gross interest earned on the loans it advances.Tusk is operating at a level which, while demonstably profitable, would not attract many private equity investors. Working with small, emerging contractors was not something the consulting engineering industry in South Africa was accostumed to doing. Imali Capital started out as the ""venture catalyst"" arm of the Theta group which is very focused on microlending. It was seen as very appropriate for it to invest in Tusk. IFC''s role in the next stage of the development of Tusk could be an important catalytic one. The expansion of the business to meet the level of demand is likely to require significantly more capital than has been invested so far. The other potential financiers which have been approached are impressed that IFC may be willing to get involved and share the risks of such a venture. The sponsors regard IFC as an ideal partner from this point of view. On the debt side, it is also difficult to raise lines of credit for a business which has not a lot of hard assets to offer as security. Therefor, there is a strong role for IFC to play as both a financier and a knowledgable partner which would give comfort to the other minority shareholders. Imali Capital is very keen to have other institutional investors on board and to have more than one option when it comes to raising lines of credit.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure.

As a result, by 2005, it would own twenty of its thirty two B737 aircraft and have on lease twelve Boeing 737s and five French-made ATR-72s. As part of the project, the company also plans to purchase and install a new generation Boeing 737-800 flight simulator and a Boeing 737-400 Flight Training Device. The Canadian-built simulator would enable Jets pilots to undergo more rigorous in-house training and significantly cut-down its training costs and dependence on other international airlines. The  acquisition of the new generation 737-800s and 737-700s is part of Jets continued strategy to fly a modern, young fleet with high fuel efficiency, low operating and maintenance costs. With this acquisition, the company would have a range of capacities within the same aircraft family (Boeing 737) enabling it to mix and match its fleet operations to the needs of the varying market segments. The project would further improve Jet''s existing service level, expand services to remote areas of India, force increased competition in the air transport sector in India and bring about greater benefits to the Indian air traveller. Whereever achieved, airline deregulation has led to significant gains from: - better service at lower cost, thus lowering business travel expenses and creating new tourism markets; - better utilization of public facilities like airports and air navigation systems; and - improved service for more remote and low traffic regions through service design improvements.As 90 percent of the airline traffic in India is business related, increased frequencies and wider geographical coverage extending to some of the remote regions of the country would positively impact the overall growth and development of business in these areas. The project is consistent with the World Banks strategy in India to promote the growth and development of infrastructure in the country. IFCs participation in Jet''s fleet expansion, given the government''s announced plans to privatize Indian Airlines, would further encourage private investment in the air transport sector in India and reduce the pressure on  scarce public resources in the country. The infusion of quasi-equity by IFC would strengthen Jets financial position and prepare the company for tapping the international capital markets for its future needs.","","","","","","","","","","","This is an environmental and social review category B project.

The school started operations on rented premises in 1991 with 2 nursery classes and one primary class. Its curriculum, which is based on the national curriculum, is designed to offer students from nursery to secondary school, modern and practical approaches to education. The project is in its second phase and involves expansion through construction and operation of nursery, primary and secondary schools for a total capacity of approximately 2,300 students, together with common areas, sporting facilities and bus and refectory service. The project will help consolidate HOBECs leading position in the private education sector, implement a MIS system, correct its unbalanced financial structure, improve financial results, broaden the curriculae and enable further development.By participating in the project, IFC would provide long-term resources, which are in short supply locally and are critical for the completion of the project. IFC is one of the very few institutions financing private education investments. By supporting this project IFC is expected to encourage increased private investments in the sector. A successful investment would demonstrate to more conservative financial institutions that investments in schools could be profitable. IFC and sponsor will share their experiences in this project so that others may learn from it.The development impact resulting from the project are as follows:Provide more education choices: The project will contribute to providing quality bilingual education in Douala area, where similar quality education is scarce, and often, the only other option is deficient public education.Complement the efforts of the Government of Cameroon (GoC): By offering about 2,300 student slots, the project will free needed capacity in the public school system and make room for pupils from lower-income groups. The GoC is experiencing budgetary restrictions aimed at restoring macroeconomic equilibrium and maintaining adequate debt service. The additional resources mobilized for this project will substitute for public subsidies to private and missionary education (HOBEC has never benefited from such subsidies), that the Government could no longer afford. Although currently at US$173 million for 1999/2000, recurrent governments budget allocation for education dropped from US$124 million in 1992/1993 to US$76 million in 1994/1995. And for the past decade the government has not been able to balance its budget. The project will enhance Cameroons stock of human capital by graduating a higher percentage of students expected to enroll in various universities and colleges in Cameroon and abroad.Create additional jobs: The project will create 40 new jobs, of which 29 are teaching positions.Socio-political impact: HOBEC will graduate students that are truly bilingual and sharing a common culture, thus further cementing national unity. Raise the standards: HOBEC''s valuable competition to both public and private schools, should contribute to raising of standards throughout the system.Enhance bottom-line discipline and managerial efficiency: working with IFC has led HOBEC to conduct careful market studies, develop business plans and agree to accepted audits of their finances. These tasks, supported through the technical expertise that IFC will offer, will be of critical benefit to this company not accustomed to working in internationally accepted standards.Encourage commercial lending to private education: Finally, if successful, the project will serve as a model and encourage the development of a pool of quality and well-structured loan funded educational institutions.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

It is part of a broader initiative consisting of two complementary components: (i) the CPDF, and (ii) a Sichuan Investment and Credit Guarantee Company (SIGC), which is being processed simultaneously. The emphasis of the initiative is on reaching SME clients in a more cost-effective way, by channelling assistance and financing through intermediaries. The facility would have three closely linked and complementary programs:(A)	Enterprise Level Support (i) to assist the preparation, structuring, implementation and monitoring of investment projects; (ii) in the context of project work, to provide technical assistance to individual enterprises to overcome internal governance constraints to their development. (B)	Capacity-building & Private Sector Policy Work (i) to develop local managerial and SME support services capacities through training and institutional strengthening, targeted at groups of small business managers, industry associations, local banks, accounting and consultancy companies and related support agencies; (ii) to advocate and support improvements in the business environment for SMEs development through studies and seminars on key areas such as property rights, corporate governance, and SME financing.(C)	Collaboration with the SIGC (i) to strongly support and complement the operation of the SIGC, targeted at companies assisted under Program A and other companies which qualify; (ii) to work closely on the preparation, structuring, implementation and monitoring of investment projects with SIGC''s Participating Banks (PBs) and in this context provide PBs with capacity-building services in the areas of project finance, risk and portfolio management.  IFC''s role: IFC designed the project concept based on an extensive analysis of the environment for private sector development in China and Sichuan, and in response to the country''s priorities to stimulate SME development, especially in the interior provinces of China. The project would benefit from IFC''s strong record in Sichuan and the accumulated knowledge about the province over the last six years. CPDF will be managed by IFC and as such will benefit from IFC''s experience in implementing and managing project development facilities. CPDF will be IFC''s 6th project development facility and incorporates the best practices in the existing facilities. Further, with the creation of the global SME department, IFC would be able to provide this and the other facilities with greater administrative and technical support and would facilitate transfer of knowledge and best practices among the existing and new facilities. Developmental impact: The private sector in China is at a critical juncture in its development: first, constraints such as inadequately developed formal business planning and management skills, poor accounting practices, and difficult access to bank loans and equity, are preventing enterprises from taking full advantage of expanding opportunities in the context of a more benign official attitude to private sector development; second, the prospects of WTO membership portend both benefits of globalization and challenges of increased competition. Through its activities for enterprise level support, capacity-building, and dissemination of best practices, the facility will work towards alleviating these constraints to private SME development. In the process, the facility would be building a sustainable local capacity to deliver the type of services CPDF would be providing.  By focusing its impact on a relatively poor interior province, the facility would be part of the larger effort to redress the growing regional disparities between the coast and the Interior.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category C project, according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because it is likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts.Location of environmental documents In locally affected community","IFC and international donors.

Doverie Brico,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,Bulgaria,DOVERIE - BRICO AD,Regional Industry - MAS ECA,2000-06-01T04:00:00Z,2000-07-10T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"The project involves the establishment and operation of a DM 29.3 million retail business, comprising five stores in Bulgaria and Macedonia.  The project company, Doverie Brico, has bought a franchise from a French operator, Mr. Bricolage.  The retail business will carry the name of the franchisor and will offer a wide variety of home improvement/repair products, as well as specialized services.The project will be implemented in three stages over a three-year period.  The first store will be opened in Sofia in September, 2000.  The second and third store will be opened in two other Bulgarian cities in April 2001, and the fourth and fifth stores (either two in Bulgaria, or one in Bulgaria and one in Macedonia) will be operational in April 2002.  All the stores will have a standard outlook and internal design, an integral part of the Mr. Bricolage franchise.  IFC''s role in the proposed project could be valuable on several grounds:  (i)  In view of the perceived macro-economic and political risks to investing in Bulgaria and Macedonia, particularly for greenfield projects, IFCs presence in this transaction will help increase investors confidence in the business environment of the region, and in the governments'' privatization efforts.  IFCs participation in the project, and the partnership with Mr. Bricolage, a leader in the French home improvement products market, will provide a significant demonstration effect in support of foreign investment in the region;  (ii)  IFC''s proposed investment will supply a source of long-term funds on reasonable terms otherwise not available to the company; (iii)  IFC will play an important role in determining the project scope, structuring the financial plan, evaluating the environmental issues, thus reducing the project''s risk profile.The project will have a significant developmental impact, as follows: (i)  Providing consumers with a wide range of good quality home improvement products, presented in an attractive environment, and at affordable price.  The collective strength of a franchise system provides opportunities for purchasing and marketing economies.  (ii)  Technology & know-how transfer:  The company in co-operation with the franchisor, will bring in proven integrated distribution system expertise, especially with its fully automated inventory control system, safety standards, advanced marketing and sales techniques and quality control systems.  (iii) Upgrading business practices:  The project will have a catalytic effect in developing and improving the quality of  local suppliers and producers.  Since eventually more than half of the product range is expected to be sourced locally, the company will have to work closely with local suppliers and producers to improve their quality in order to meet the quality standards of the franchise.   (iv)  Promoting SME and private sector development:  The project would have a positive effect on the development of the home repair/improvement and construction services industry, which was underdeveloped during the years of state planning.  This industry has emerged in the last decade and comprises mostly of SMEs.  The project would facilitate market entry and improve service quality through standardization, larger selection of products, and reliable supply.  (v)  Demonstration effect:  The project would provide a significant demonstration effect, as its success would encourage other companies pursuing investment opportunities in Bulgaria and Macedonia, as the countries'' perceived risk begins to diminish  (vi)  Increased employment: The project will create new employment, both directly and indirectly.  It will provide direct employment to about 200 employees, mostly women, with a significant multiple of that number expected to be added in the supply stream and in ancillary activities.  In addition, temporary employment will be provided to local labor during the construction phase of the project.  (vii)   Improved skills base:  Integrated part of the turn-key package provided by the franchisor, is a comprehensive training program, for the stores'' personnel including training in Mr. Bricolage stores in France.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityThe Environmental Review Summary (ERS) was translated in Bulgarian and disclosed to the public at the office of Doverie Brico: 63 A Iskar Street, Sofia, Bulgaria, and at the entrance of the first construction site in Sofia on Tzarigradsko Shosse.

The plant, with a capacity of 30,000 tpy, was located in the industrial city of 6th of October, 45 km south of Cairo.  The project was completed in June 1998, three months behind schedule.  Project cost was 29% higher than projected, as several converting machines - out of the original project scope - were added to the investment program, the cost overrun was financed via a subordinated loan from the shareholders.During the first 18 months of operation Unipak-Nile built-up its customer base (to over 300 customers by the first quarter of year 2000) and searched for a niche in the market where it would shield itself from price competition and the volatility of the Egyptian economy. The company''s strategy is to minimise its exposure to large clients, process small volume orders with high added value. To do that efficiently Unipak-Nile needs to enhance the finishing capacity of its manufacturing facility beyond the existing corrugator.The proposed investment will allow more efficient utilisation of current capacity, improve significantly its response time to the market requirements, allow for a wider line offering of sophisticated products, cut costs, and provide extra storage capacity. This new investment program will involve: (i) building a warehouse for raw materials and finished products; (ii)  rebuilding the dry-end of the existing corrugator; (iii) an off line printing machine; (iv) an automatic pallet strapper; (v) a cliché processing and mounting unit; and (vi) ancillary machinery and equipment.  The project cost is US$ 5.96 million. IFC was approached by the sponsors requesting an additional loan of up to US$ 2.89 million.IFCs main role would be to provide long-term funding in foreign-exchange to the project.  Although banks in Egypt are currently liquid, the terms and conditions offered by IFC on its proposed loan cannot be easily matched locally.  IFC is also playing an instrumental role in helping the sponsor mobilise additional funding to complete the financial plan in the form of a co-lender or an IFC B loan syndication as well as introducing the sponsor to local banks. IFC helped structure the project financing by advising the sponsor to have a more conservative leverage and by accounting for working capital, interest during implementation and contingencies in the total project cost and financing plan. Finally, by educating the company''s management and encouraging the company to adhere to strict WBG environmental policies and guidelines, the project will help improve environmental standards in the nearby community and the country. Hopefully some demonstration effect will also result.Development ImpactSectoral development: The project will ensure the long-term viability of the Egyptian industry sector leader by enhancing its competitiveness, and increasing its efficiency.  In addition, it will raise the industry''s standards and degree of sophistication by introducing higher quality and more diversified products.Technological Development: The project includes a significant modernisation and updating of the existing plant, which will allow an existing company to remain viable regionally and competitive internationally in the long run.  The project will also introduce, through state-of-the-art technology and the sponsor''s extensive know-how, new quality products in the Egyptian paper sector.Export Promotion: The high quality boxes produced by the project would in part be used for the export of locally-produced goods making them more competitive in foreign markets.  As a result, the project will indirectly promote Egyptian exports.Foreign Exchange Savings: resulting from reduced imports of high quality corrugated carton boxes.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognised performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityThe Environmental Review Summary will be disclosed locally at the gate  of the mosque, the market entrance and the gate of the company.","The project is sponsored by the Frem Industrial Group (FIG) and the Indevco Group.

The project consists of investing up to US$250,000 of equity in the second round of capitalization of Learning Universe Private Limited (LU), a company based in Delhi, India, which owns eGurucool.com, an education portal.  eGurucool aims to provide an on-line learning universe to students in India through an optimized integration of technology, content, and training.  Learning Universe aims at capitalizing on the ability of technology to deliver high quality education  at a lower cost via the use of the Internet.  The Internet has inherent advantages as it can reach widely scattered schools and students with quality content and input.  The interactivity of the medium and its ability to customize content make on-line education seem to be the way forward with two-way flow of information between students, teachers, counselors, schools, and others.  eGurucool.com has a comprehensive range of content.  This includes academic curricula for schools through tailored tutorials, tutoring and testing for competitive examinations, academic content for graduate studies, career counseling, and a 24-hour on-line help-line for students appearing for board exams.  The Company plans to host various school accounts in its server to create a large education network.  These schools would offer and share courses, tests and mock board exams on-line, as well as build up a community based on which students can obtain percentile rankings on their performance in various tests and exams.   While most schools will be charged for these services, eGurucool is seeking ways of accessing funds and free computer equipment to be installed in poorer schools in both metropolises and remote areas.  eGurucool is already offering some government schools with free websites and other services.

At full capacity, Julietta will process 122,500 tonnes of ore per year to produce 0.4 million oz. of gold and 6 million oz. of silver over the initial 4.5 year mine life.  The mining resources estimated at 0.6 million tonnes can be upgraded to the proven and probable category with additional capital expenditure which would extend the life of the mine by another 5 years.  A combination of high gold grades and high gold recovery should make Julietta one of the world''s lowest cost producers.  The project will have a positive development impact on Russian economy. The successful implementation of the project will support local government''s efforts in attracting foreign investors to the mining sector and will further contribute to the development of the business environment conducive to the foreign investment.

In addition, the presence of IFC would further ensure that environmental care and diligence at Julietta would be maintained at appropriate standards, which can be used for future mining projects in Russia.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a category A project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedure, because it will potentially have significant adverse environmental impacts that are sensitive, diverse, or unprecedented.  The Omsukchan Mining and Geological Company (OMGC), a subsidiary of Bema Gold Corporation (Bema) has retained DewPoint International LLC, an independent consultant to prepare a comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (EIA) in English, which addresses several key environmental and social issues associated with the project''s implementation, construction, and operation.  The EIA includes a detailed Environmental Action Plan (EAP) that will be updated and expanded during the development of the project.  Public consultation and disclosure (PCD) were carried out in accordance with Russian and World Bank group requirements.  A separate Russian version of the EIA (the OVOS) was prepared in accordance with local and national regulations.  The Russian version was also disclosed in country and received final approval by the authorities in September 1997.  The results of these consultations as well as the OVOS updates and subsequent recommendations have been incorporated into the EIA/EAP which were released to the World Bank InfoShop and in Russia on January 3, 2000.Based on a review of the information supplied in the EIA and related documents, IFCs Environment Division concludes that the project is consistent with applicable Russian standards and World Bank Group policies and guidelines.  More details are provided below.- Environment, Health and Safety This is a greenfield project.  Key environmental issues include: air and dust emissions, water resources and water quality, habitat and ecology, tailings impoundment, dam stability and sedimentation ponds, solid and liquid waste management, handling and storage of hazardous materials, noise and visual impacts, and reclamation and closure.  Health and safety issues include underground safety, employees training, occupational health and safety, general housekeeping and fire prevention.  The EIA includes a detailed review of the environmental conditions of the exploration facilities, an updated baseline study on ecology, wildlife, surface water and ground water, soil and hydrobiology, and a discussion on impacts from previous activities as well as impacts during construction, and potential impacts when underground mining and milling and processing (including tailings disposal) will take place.  An analysis of alternatives is complete.  The EAP presents a set of mitigation measures, a risk assessment, detailed monitoring activities, and various management plans (staffing and training, occupational health and safety, underground safety, emergency response, waste, reclamation and closure).  Detailed implementation schedules and cost estimates were developed with clear benchmarks to meet and achieve.To comply with IFC requirements and Russian regulations, the EAP will be updated as needed.  It will include any required additional mitigation measures, a revised version of plans for monitoring, assessing and preventing impacts, and all necessary modifications of the schedules and estimates.  Full public disclosure will take place along the same lines as taken for the EIA and OVOS.  It is anticipated that the first EAP revision will be published in July 2000.OMGC has agreed to prepare a detailed mine reclamation and closure plan and to set aside financial provisions over the life of the mine to implement it.  OMGC also has agreed to adopt and implement an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) which will assist mine and mill management to meet both current and future environmental issues.  IFC also carried out a review of Bemas environmental practice and management.  Environmental and safety issues are integrated into all aspects and stages of their business activities.- Social AspectsThe main population center in the project''s impact area is the mining settlement and administrative center of Omsukchan with a population of 6,100.  Approximately, five percent of the population living in Omsukchan Region is officially recognized as indigenous peoples, with most of them fully integrated in the Omsukchan community.  This area has been seriously affected by the cessation of operation of the surrounding mines after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  Unofficial estimates put rates of unemployment and underemployment at close to 100%.According to the EIA, negative social impacts, if any, are very limited.  There is potential to enhance mainly positive impacts in terms of employment created by the start up of construction phase and mining operations and the generation of tax revenue for the local municipality which will lead to much needed improvements in infrastructure and service provision.

The Omsukchan Mining and Geological Company (OMGC), a subsidiary of Bema Gold Corporation (Bema) has retained DewPoint International LLC, an independent consultant to prepare a comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (EIA) in English, which addresses several key environmental and social issues associated with the project''s implementation, construction, and operation.  The EIA includes a detailed Environmental Action Plan (EAP) that will be updated and expanded during the development of the project.  Public consultation and disclosure (PCD) were carried out in accordance with Russian and World Bank group requirements.  A separate Russian version of the EIA (the OVOS) was prepared in accordance with local and national regulations.  The Russian version was also disclosed in country and received final approval by the authorities in September 1997.  The results of these consultations as well as the OVOS updates and subsequent recommendations have been incorporated into the EIA/EAP which were released to the World Bank InfoShop and in Russia on January 3, 2000.Based on a review of the information supplied in the EIA and related documents, IFCs Environment Division concludes that the project is consistent with applicable Russian standards and World Bank Group policies and guidelines.  More details are provided below.- Environment, Health and Safety This is a greenfield project.  Key environmental issues include: air and dust emissions, water resources and water quality, habitat and ecology, tailings impoundment, dam stability and sedimentation ponds, solid and liquid waste management, handling and storage of hazardous materials, noise and visual impacts, and reclamation and closure.  Health and safety issues include underground safety, employees training, occupational health and safety, general housekeeping and fire prevention.  The EIA includes a detailed review of the environmental conditions of the exploration facilities, an updated baseline study on ecology, wildlife, surface water and ground water, soil and hydrobiology, and a discussion on impacts from previous activities as well as impacts during construction, and potential impacts when underground mining and milling and processing (including tailings disposal) will take place.  An analysis of alternatives is complete.  The EAP presents a set of mitigation measures, a risk assessment, detailed monitoring activities, and various management plans (staffing and training, occupational health and safety, underground safety, emergency response, waste, reclamation and closure).  Detailed implementation schedules and cost estimates were developed with clear benchmarks to meet and achieve.To comply with IFC requirements and Russian regulations, the EAP will be updated as needed.  It will include any required additional mitigation measures, a revised version of plans for monitoring, assessing and preventing impacts, and all necessary modifications of the schedules and estimates.  Full public disclosure will take place along the same lines as taken for the EIA and OVOS.  It is anticipated that the first EAP revision will be published in July 2000.OMGC has agreed to prepare a detailed mine reclamation and closure plan and to set aside financial provisions over the life of the mine to implement it.  OMGC also has agreed to adopt and implement an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) which will assist mine and mill management to meet both current and future environmental issues.  IFC also carried out a review of Bemas environmental practice and management.  Environmental and safety issues are integrated into all aspects and stages of their business activities.- Social AspectsThe main population center in the project''s impact area is the mining settlement and administrative center of Omsukchan with a population of 6,100.  Approximately, five percent of the population living in Omsukchan Region is officially recognized as indigenous peoples, with most of them fully integrated in the Omsukchan community.  This area has been seriously affected by the cessation of operation of the surrounding mines after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  Unofficial estimates put rates of unemployment and underemployment at close to 100%.According to the EIA, negative social impacts, if any, are very limited.  There is potential to enhance mainly positive impacts in terms of employment created by the start up of construction phase and mining operations and the generation of tax revenue for the local municipality which will lead to much needed improvements in infrastructure and service provision.  In addition, the Company is considering making available employment opportunities for Indigenous People and establishing a community development program.In conjunction with the Dukat Silver Mine investment, IFC has initiated a Technical Assistance Program in the Magadan Oblast mainly focused at the Omsukchan region.

The role of the education system is crucial in supplying the human resources required for faster economic growth and successful competition in the global markets.  Argentinas industrial and services sector underwent a major restructuring following the opening of the economy in 1991 to improve quality, productivity and profitability.  These developments, coupled with the increasing globalization of markets, have induced a shift in the skills required by todays labor force.  Companies are seeking more qualified employees and increasingly demanding individuals with a post-secondary education.  Increases in productivity could be jeopardized unless the education system is able to match the demands of the market for well-educated, skilled and flexible graduates.  Investments in the private system will complement an overcrowded public system and enhance the overall quality of higher education and its graduates.Education remains a sector where financial institutions generally are unwilling to invest.  By taking the lead, IFC will demonstrate to others the commercial viability of private investment in institutions like USAL.

IWorld expects to become the preferred hub for information and an electronic transaction facilitator for the infrastructure sector worldwide.  Finally, IWorld plans to provide project management tools to its customers to facilitate consistent, efficient and timely management of projects under implementation, irrespective of geographic location.  The main value that IWorld seeks to add is to infrastructure players who do not currently have the resources and access of the major large-scale infrastructure providers and developers.  The products being developed by IWorld will provide an enabling environment to local developing country users, such as governments, grantors of concessions, infrastructure developers, contractors, equipment suppliers, financiers and other ancillary service providers to compete effectively in the infrastructure marketplace.  Such local players would be able to quickly develop expertise, gather tools, put together and conduct transactions and participate in the global infrastructure community through the IWorld portal.  The core advantage of such a portal is that it will enable new entrants to the infrastructure marketplace, especially in developing countries.With the proposed partnership with IWorld, IFC and the World Bank Group will have a unique opportunity to influence a significant evolution in infrastructure development and privatization and to leverage their substantial experience in emerging markets infrastructure development.  More specifically, it is expected that IFC would be able to add great value to IWorld in the following ways: (i) IFC''s wide experience in many developing countries will help to shape IWorld''s efforts in such  markets; (ii) IFC''s presence and requirements would help assure the neutrality of the website, hence creating an open forum which would attract participation from all parties; (iii) IFC''s regional presence, its partnerships with local governments, businesses, and NGOs would play a key role in IWorld''s marketing strategy to become a truly global player; and (iv) IWorld is interested to have access to IFC''s in-depth knowledge of sustainable infrastructure project development and financing in order to be able to provide best practice to its customers.The success of IWorld would have a profound impact on sustainable infrastructure development in developing countries.  By participating in a global best practice marketplace, developing country infrastructure players would have timely access to information, ideas and technology that their counterparts in developed countries are using.  IWorld''s proposed transaction exchange would make procurement more efficient and competitive.  In addition, it would open up the global marketplace to developing country contractors and suppliers, thereby helping to break the monopoly of a few large players.  IWorld''s success would also have a major impact in increasing transparency in infrastructure transactions and thereby decreasing corruption.  Developing country reformers would have a user-friendly, inexpensive and time-efficient tool for conducting competitive bids for privatizations, concessions and other types of project development.

Currently, MSICIH has stakes in operations in Egypt, Gabon, Hong Kong SAR, Malawi, the Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Uganda and Zambia.  In addition, the Company has won additional licenses in Burkina Faso, Chad and the Democratic Republic of Congo and recently started developing and implementing the networks.  MSICIH owns another cellular license in Guinea (purchased from a winning bidder).  MSICIH is also a 50% partner in a consortium that submitted the highest bid to become the strategic equity partner in Tanzania Telecommunications Company Limited, the national wireline operator.  The Company is currently in negotiations with the Government of Tanzania to complete the privatization.  Furthermore, MSICIH is negotiating the purchase of 60% of the shares of a cellular company in Sudan, Mobitel.  With the exception of Zambia, in all Sub-Saharan African countries where MSICIH owns a majority stake, MSICIH''s operating subsidiary operates or will operate under the brand name Celtel.  The proposed IFC investment will be used to build-out the networks in any of these countries (subject to final agreement between IFC and MSICIH), and the first two operating companies that are likely to receive financing are Celtel Malawi and Celtel Congo S.A.Celtel Malawi is owned by MSICIH (80%), the Malawi Development Corporation (10%), and the Investment and Development Bank of Malawi (10%).  Celtel Malawi was awarded its nation-wide GSM 900 license by the Ministry of Information on December 25, 1998 following a competitive tender.  The license has a 15-year life and is renewable.  Celtel Malawi''s sole competitor is Telecom Network Limited (""TNL""), which is owned by Telekom Malaysia (60%) and Malawi Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, the state-owned wireline operator.Celtel Congo S.A. is located in the Republic of Congo, and is owned by MSICIH (70%) and Gestilac (30%), a Swiss company with strong ties to the local business community.  Celtel Congo S.A. was awarded its GSM 900 license on December 15, 1998 after the Ministry heard presentations from a number of interested operators.  Celtel Congo S.A.''s only current competitors are Cyrtel, which is a 50:50 joint venture between Investcom and France Telecom, and Libertis, majority owned by Orascom, which just began operations in May 2000.The proposed project would be IFCs first telecommunications investments devoted specifically to Malawi and the Republic of Congo.  The primary role of IFC in this project would be to reach countries where IFC has not had a major impact in the past, and provide long-term financing to be used in countries where any sort of commercial financing is scarce.  IFC would also play an important catalytic role, encouraging investments from other financial institutions that would be unlikely to invest without IFCs interest or involvement.  Third, IFCs investment would demonstrate support for private sector development in the Republic of Congo and Malawi at a critical time in these countries.MSICIHs investment activities will have a broad beneficial impact on the entry of private investors to infrastructure sectors in Africa.  This proposed investment would be the largest investment in Malawi (where IFC''s total held portfolio as of June 30, 1999 was US$1.9 million) and would re-introduce IFC to the Republic of Congo (where IFC has only two investments, the most recent committed in 1996), thus providing demonstrations of the value of private sector involvement in basic infrastructure services.  Moreover, this Project would help modernize and expand the telecommunications networks in these countries, where penetration is extremely low.  Finally, the proposed investment program is designed to expand current telecommunications services options and improve service quality, in some cases bringing modern telecommunications technology to some regions of the countries for the first time.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.

In 1996, IFC arranged a debt investment of US$35 million to help finance a US$65.1 million capital expenditure program for Telecel to expand its mobile cellular network (IFC/R96-155).  The implementation of that project is ahead of schedule and the subscriber growth exceeds IFC''s projections.  However, a competing operator launched cellular services in 1997, and both the magnitude of competition and the pace of the shift from post-paid to prepaid subscribers were underestimated.  Competition led to lower tariffs, and the surge in prepaid subscribers caused some network congestion, which, in turn, led to prepaid subscribers crowding out higher value post-paid subscribers.  As a result, many post-paid subscribers left Telecel for the competitor, whose network is largely digitized.  In addition, in 1999 the company still had a cost structure designed for a different customer base.  In late 1999, the company began to address these issues, bringing in a new management team, reducing operating costs significantly, and digitizing some of the network, beginning in the urban areas.  Thus, the purpose of the project is to help (1) finance the expansion and continuing digitization of Telecel cellular network in order to meet competition, and (2) to improve the company''s debt profile by extending/restructuring existing debt, allowing the company to focus on needed capital expenditures rather than debt repayments in the next 2 years.IFC''s financing  would replace existing debt that comes due in the next 1-2 years with long-term finance, more appropriate for an established cellular company that is experiencing high growth.  The longer maturities and grace period will give Telecel an opportunity to expand and digitize its network.  In addition, IFC would be playing a catalytic role, encouraging investments from other financial institutions that would be unlikely to invest without IFC''s involvement.  Moreover, IFC''s investment would demonstrate its continued support for the development of Bolivia''s private sector, promoting sustainable development through growth of established private companies.This project would improve communications in Bolivia, increasing efficiency in the business community and better connecting Bolivia to the global economy.  Improved telecommunications would likely encourage investments in other sectors, thereby promoting economic growth.  Moreover, this project would actively promote competition, allowing Telecel to keep pace with its competitor, thereby helping to lower telecommunications tariffs and making cellular communications more accessible to larger segments of the population.  The proposed new expansion is also likely to create additional jobs during the construction of the network.","","","","","","","","","","",This is a category C project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.

The Company owns Chagala Hotel, a three-star hotel in Atyrau, and a small guesthouse in settlement Bautino, south of Atyrau and close to the Caspian oilfields, a site of the marine-supply base constructed by Offshore Kazakhstan International Operating Company (OKIOC).The proposed project consists of the expansion and development of the Chagala Hotel and of the guesthouse in Bautino. The hotel and guesthouse offer rooms in $80-$120 range and the target market is oil workers and associated staff involved with the oil exploration and development work in the Caspian.  This will be IFC''s first investment in this strategically important area of Kazakhstan, which is expected to be the prime driver of growth for the next twenty years.  The expansion of the Chagala Hotel will meet the growing needs of the international oil companies and related support companies that are developing the new Kashagan oilfield in the Caspian Sea, which is estimated to have reserves several times that of the North Sea.  Following this discovery, neither the Chagala Hotel nor the Bautino guesthouse can meet demand.IFC has a strong role to play in this project through the provision of long-term funding.  Term financing is practically unavailable in Kazakhstan and IFC''s financing will enable the company to expand the Chagala Hotel and Bautino guesthouse to meet the needs of international clients.  IFCs participation in the project is also expected to facilitate the company''s future access to international borrowing.

According to Economist Intelligence Unit, the oil and gas sector alone accounts for 44% of total exports and 85% of total FDI flow of Kazakhstan.  The region''s enormous oil and gas reserves have attracted scores of foreign oil and gas companies (Chevron, Shell, British Gas/Petroleum, Total, Agip and others) since the country gained independence from Soviet Union in 1991.  However, the region''s basic infrastructure and services are under-developed and exploration work is a real challenge for foreign oil and gas companies.  To address the shortage of export capacity, a consortium led by Chevron is in the process of building a $2.3 billion pipeline, that will transport Caspian Sea oil to the Black Sea.

PriceSmart,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Latin America Region,"Price Ventures, Inc","Gbl Ind, Manufact, Agribus & Services",2000-09-01T04:00:00Z,2000-10-27T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"The project will expand PriceSmarts existing warehouse-stores in Central America and the Caribbean through the constructing and operation of 13 deep discount, no-frills membership-shopping warehouses. These warehouse stores are similar to, but smaller in size than, warehouse clubs in the US.  They sell a variety of food and consumer goods with an emphasis on quality, low prices and efficient operations. Product selection is approximately 60% food and 40% non-food items.  About 45% of sales are derived from products sourced in the local or regional markets. Project JustificationStrategic fit:  The project is consistent with PSMTs strategy is to develop, own and operate international merchandising business in emerging markets by investing in, acquiring, or creating new retail warehouse membership-shopping businesses that leverage existing and local capabilities. Market gap:  The project will capitalize on the absence of membership warehouse type shopping that deliver quality, value and low prices for: i) US. brand-name products that are not currently widely available in such markets; and ii) branded local and regionally-sourced products.  Typically, the target countries are characterized by high-priced local competitors with minimal experience with modern operating processes in purchasing, distribution, merchandising and information technology.Lower prices to consumers:  PSMTs strategy is to offer quality, value and low prices through its high-volume low-cost operation. Its goal to be the ""low-price leader"" for the markets served is achieved by offering a limited range of products in a low-cost, US-style no frills warehouse type environment. Strong, experienced, and knowledgeable sponsor:  PSMT will leverage the successful US. warehouse retailing concept, its existing organizational infrastructure and stores including economies of scale in buying (as stores are added, buying power and negotiating leverage improves), low-cost distribution, network of suppliers, and experienced human capital.Positive development impact and role:  The project will introduce new merchandising technology, provide about 1,800 direct jobs and respond to local needs by being an important retail outlet for local products.   The project will link Central America, the Caribbean and the US. through PSMT''s buying and retailing network.  In addition, although PSMT is a public US corporation, IFC''s support is needed as it cannot access US funding since its warehouses are located outside the US and its shares are not actively traded.IFCs RoleIFCs role is to provide long term financing not readily available for private firms in the Caribbean and Central America.  In the current international financial market environment, unassisted access to the eurobond or international syndicated loan markets is virtually closed, save for top-tier firms in Mexico or Argentina.   The projects requirement for a significant amount of long-term debt with long maturities (not readily available in the region) precludes it from obtaining US dollars from local sources.  In addition, the project''s regional nature works against its ability to access local bank financing.  Moreover, PSMT cannot readily access US funding as its warehouses are located outside the US and its shares are not actively traded on NASDAQ.  Thus, IFCs ""A"" and ""C"" Loans will meet the projects needs and strengthen its financial structure. IFC will also assist the project by mobilizing funds from international commercial banks, and by providing environmental oversight to ensure that the project meets World Bank Group guidelines, along with its financing. Development ImpactThe project will have a strong developmental impact by expanding and strengthening the retail industry in each country and in so doing provide consumers with lower prices on a wide variety of food and quality consumer goods through increased efficiencies of purchasing, logistics, technology and distribution.  Thus the project will help contribute meaningfully to raising the real standard of living for a large portion of the population in each of the target countries.  The project will bring the convenience of warehouse shopping to large portions of the population in several countries in Central America and the Caribbean.The project will provide outlets for local products and foster the production of quality goods; it will help improve the competitiveness of those countries industry and agriculture.  Currently, PSMT sources about 45% of its goods locally or regionally (including produce, meats, soft drinks and brewery, soaps, milks, etc.  The project will help introduce international best practices and bring modern technology by helping suppliers to adopt bar coding and other sophisticated MIS systems.  In addition, the project will create about 1,800 permanent employees (about 138 per store); many more indirect jobs will be created.  In addition, significant opportunities exists for training, acquiring merchandising skills, and promotion within the group as PSMT advertises job opportunities for domestic, regional and international jobs internally and on its Web site. The project will also link markets in Central America, the Caribbean and the US through PSMT''s buying and retailing network.  It will give Central American as well as Caribbean manufacturers access to PSMT''s members in the US and Asia as well as in each other''s markets.  In addition, the project has already mobilized capital from the region and introduced Latin American investors to the Caribbean; it could also serve as a catalyst for further investment.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityThe Environmental Review Summary (ERS) will be posted at the bulletin board in each of the wharehouses, as follows:Zapote Store: Ruta 204.

The syndicated loan was restructured in late 1999 and entails: (1) an annual option where the syndicate lenders have an option to call their loan if two-thirds of the lenders request such prepayment; (2) instalments of US$ 5 million during 2000, 2001 and 2002; and (3) a bullet repayment of US$ 22 million in September 2002. Since the company''s cash generation in 1999 was US$ 13 million, it is clear that the company cannot service the bullet repayment out of its operational cash flow. In addition, with respect to the refinancing of the bullet payment, some syndicate lenders have already indicated that they do not want to refinance due to reduced country exposure limits and their corporate strategy to get out of the loan business.  The purpose of the croject is to restructure the syndicated loan and to extend the loan maturity so that the debt could be reasonably serviced by the company''s operational cash flow.Development Impact and IFC''s RoleThe purposed investment''s main development impact is the demonstration effect that will be created by IFC''s support to an Indonesian company at a time when local commercial banks are unable and foreign commercial banks are still reluctant to consider long-term financing. By helping viable companies continue normal production and remain competitive, IFCs lending at this time will send a positive signal to international investors and restore some of the confidence in the Indonesian private sector. IFCs B loan umbrella will also provide additional assurance to foreign lenders inducing them to increase their exposure and extend their maturity.In addition, by supporting an export-oriented company such as Sunson, the project will generate foreign exchange revenues necessary to assist Indonesia''s economic recovery.The project also provides for knowledge transfer to a second tier company that has shown strong interest in further improving its management practices.

Operations will be conducted primarily from Almaty, Kazakhstan, with a branch office in Tashkent, Uzbekistan - satellite offices will be set up in Bishkek in Kyrgyz Republic, Dushanbe in Tajikistan, and Ashgabat in Turkmenistan as opportunities arise.   The proposed project will be one of the few equity funds in the region and will be unique in addressing equity financing/venture capital for small businesses. Important impediments to the development of the SME sector in Central Asia are lack of access to equity capital, limited availability of long-term lending, and business managers insufficient business expertise and technical training.   CASEF''s developmental impact is substantial in that it aims to alleviate these constraints by providing quasi-equity and equity capital, supplemented by appropriate technical assistance.  Local commercial banks would be encouraged to lend to some of the investee companies since the Fund will provide the necessary capital base.  The demonstration effect, particularly due to IFC''s involvement, is substantial, and is expected to help attract other equity investors in Central Asia.  The project is consistent with efforts of the World Bank Group to support the growth of the private sector in the five Republics of Central Asia.  This project is a pilot for channelling quasi-equity and equity investments to SMEs through a fund with a non-traditional, yet experienced manager in a difficult market.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Financial Intermediary (FI) Type 2 project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure.

Plivas strategy for the future is to continue to build on its existing R&D expertise by focusing on both original research, and generic drug development. IFC investment will support the construction and outfitting of a new 25,000 square meter Research and Development facility.  Currently, the company''s R&D is conducted in three different locations and suffers from space limitations.  Consolidation of R&D activities in one state of the art facility will increase efficiency and multi-disciplinary interaction.  The layout and infrastructure of the new facility will ensure that all Pliva''s R&D activities will be performed in compliance with international quality requirements, or ""Good Laboratory Practice"" (GLP).  About 55% of the facility will be dedicated to new product development and 45% of the facility will be dedicated to original research.  The department for new product registration will also be located in the new facility.  The investment will also result in  a significant improvement in the working conditions of the scientists by increasing laboratory space per scientist to international standards. Pliva''s new R&D facility will employ about 500 people.

Although the Russian economy has improved much since the August crisis of 1998, this progress has had little impact on encouraging much-needed capital investment in the Region.

IFC Strategy:  Investment in the Fund fits well with IFC''s strategy in Russia in that it will support: i) mobilization of foreign direct investment and long-term debt financing; ii) investment in private sector infrastructure and natural resource development; and iii) development of locally owned businesses in the less advanced regions of the countries where they operate.","","","","","","","","","","",This is a category FI Type 2 project.

Akbank,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,Türkiye,AKBANK TURK ANONIM SIRKETI,"Global Industry, Financial Markets",2000-10-05T04:00:00Z,2000-11-14T05:00:00Z,FI,Guarantee,"The project fits well with the World Bank Group strategy in Turkey, which stresses stabilization measures such as controlling the fiscal deficit and reducing inflation through, inter alia, tax and social security reform and privatization.  This strategy aims to improve the economic environment for sustainable growth and diminish the role of the government in those areas where the private sector is capable of assuming responsibility.  IFC has sought to complement this approach by supporting viable private enterprises that are being hampered by present conditions.In the absence of a corporate bond market, commercial banks are the main source of debt financing for Turkish industrial enterprises.  There has been strong demand in Turkey over the past few years for external funding for investment purposes, but sources of term finance are limited to a handful of development banks and bank-owned leasing companies that are funded by their parent companies. IFC''s primary focus in the Turkish financial sector has been to support the development of sound financial intermediaries and to enable them to extend the scope and the tenor of their lending activities.  IFC''s investments have also broadened the use of prudential operating guidelines, setting the standards for the banking, leasing, and securities brokerage sectors.One of IFC''s primary objectives has been to increase the tenor of lending to private sector enterprises in Turkey.  While the biggest and best of the Turkish companies have been able to raise longer-term financing and many are increasingly able to do so for projects in the infrastructure and energy areas (with IFC''s help in many cases), less well known companies have access only to short maturities.  Thus, bank lending has been used primarily for trade financing, while productive investment has had to be financed from internal cash generation.  The increased availability of term loans to finance investment will enable Turkish enterprises to leverage their internal resources, and if debt/equity ratios are prudently maintained, should provide a boost to economic growth.  Feedback from IFC''s financial sector clients indicates that the enterprise sector is increasingly demanding term, as opposed to trade, financing from banks, and IFC''s recent loans have been structured to meet this need.While building on this objective, the proposed project has two additional roles for IFC: - to introduce Akbank to the institutional investor community for a dual structured and non-structured transaction, and - to provide credit for term lending to SMEs.  During 1999, through its established access to international capital markets, Akbank has borrowed $350 million in syndicated loans and $650 million in a securitized transaction. The proposed project, however, is the first opportunity for Akbank to break into the institutional investor market through a dual structured and non-structured transaction, which will allow the Bank to diversify and increase the maturity of its funding base.  With longer maturity funding, Akbank''s strategy is to increase term lending to SMEs, and develop new retail products such as mortgages and customer loans, which have become an increasingly important focus of the Bank''s activities.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category FI Type 2 project according to IFC''s environmental procedures.  Akbank will be required to undertake an environmental review of each sub-loan under the credit line to ensure compliance with Turkish environmental and occupational health and safety requirements, and applicable IFC policies.

Currently, Akbank is the largest private sector bank in Turkey in terms of shareholders'' equity and the second largest in terms of assets.  As of June 30, 2000, the Bank had total assets of $10.2 billion equivalent, total deposits of $6.3 billion equivalent and shareholders'' equity of $1.5 billion equivalent. Net profit for the first six months of 2000 was $138 million equivalent resulting in a return to average assets of 2.2% and a return on average equity of 18%.  Akbank provides a wide range of consumer, commercial and international trade finance products and services to a client base of over 500 large Turkish corporations and over 54,000 smaller companies.  The Sabanci group together with the Sabanci family and its foundation own 76.9% of the Bank with the rest being in the hands of both domestic and international investors.  The Sabanci Group is the second largest industrial and financial conglomerate in Turkey, with consolidated assets of over $13.5 billion at the end of 1999 and consolidated revenues of $9.0 billion.","It is proposed that IFC structure a $200 million transaction for Akbank, comprised of a $100 million bond backed by credit enhancement granted by IFC for up to $20 million, in addition to a syndicated term loan package, composed of a ten-year A Loan of up to $20 million and a seven-year B Loan of up to $80 million.  JP Morgan, as the placing agent,  intends to place the majority of Akbanks''s bond and the B Loan with both US and non-US institutional investors.  Akbank would use the proceeds of the financing to provide term finance to the Bank''s corporate clients and small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), and develop new retail products such as housing and consumer finance.The IFC loan would extend the maturity of Akbank''s funding base, enabling the Bank to provide term finance to private-sector enterprises in Turkey, and would support Akbank''s strategy to increase lending to financially sound SMEs. Lending to SMEs currently comprises 40% of Akbank''s total loan portfolio.  The project would be the first instance of Akbank tapping the institutional investor market for a dual structured and non-structured finance transaction and would, therefore, introduce the Bank to a new class of international investors.  Moreover, exposure to the international capital markets and IFC''s involvement would enhance Akbank''s standing by introducing the Bank''s credit, on its own merit, to investors.",45.0 million (USD)Product LineIFC Investment (million USD)Risk ManagementGuarantee25.0Loan20.0Equity* These investment figures are indicative,"Akbank is the largest private sector bank in Turkey in terms of shareholder''s equity and the second largest in terms of assets.

AL will be established with a proposed share capital of US$10 million equivalent.  The equivalent of a total funding of US$10 million for the Company''s lease operations is expected to be provided in local currency by the Caisse Nationale d''Epargne et de Prévoyance (CNEP), with a partial garantee from IFC (about 40%).Developmental Impact:  The developmental impact of the project is expected to be broad and far-reaching.  First, the project will provide SMEs with increased access to finance, many for the first time in the formal financial sector.  Currently, most SME investment requirements are not met by the existing commercial banks which require heavy collateral and overburdening administration.  Projected AL leases over US$500 million are expected to help finance the expansion and modernisation of SMEs in  various productive sectors.  This would in turn help boost  growth and  job creation.  Second,  the project is expected to promote growth and increase competition in the financial sector as the leasing industry grows and brings new players and instruments into the market. Third, the project will introduce new technology, know-how and skills transfer. Tunisie Leasing will provide external and internal training to its staff in the various areas of leasing.  Fourth, the project will support Algeria''s economic diversification by financing economic activities in non-oil related sectors.  IFC Role:  IFC has been a supporter of establishing leasing as an appropriate vehicle for addressing the financing needs of SMEs in Algeria and has assisted the World Bank in drafting the country''s leasing regulations.  IFC has approached Tunisie Leasing to act as the technical partner and has put ABC in contact with Tunisie Leasing as the foreign technical partner.  IFC is also playing a key role in structuring the project and securing the agreement of all parties by truly assuming its role as honest broker.  Furthermore, IFCs involvement is providing comfort to the Government, as well as to both local and foreign investors.  IFC is expected to continue to play a role in further developing the Company and the leasing sector.

Through an internally developed software hosted in Certifica''s premises, Certifica is able to measure their clients traffic and provide a third party independent certification that the traffic figures are correct. In addition, Certifica provides their clients with reports containing useful information that will improve internal managerial decisions. Certifica intends to become the leading company and de-facto standard in this Internet infrastructure related area across Latin America, thereby contributing to increased transparency and further build-out of the Internet on the continent. The existence of reliable and comparable traffic figures for competing websites in Latin America will allow external parties such as investors and advertisers to better allocate their scarce financial resources among Internet based companies across the region. The establishment of Internet measuring standards for the region and the existence of credible independent firms measuring and auditing Latin America''s websites is considered fundamental for the transparency and development of the sector. Certifica''s marketing campaigns include extensive education to the market about the advantages of the services it provides and plans to provide.  For example, as part of its cooperation agreement with the Chilean and Peruvian Advertising Agencies Associations, Certifica has agreed to provide free to members periodic reports about Internet usage as well as organize conferences and other events related to traffic auditing and how these traffic figures can be used by advertising agencies. Another developmental feature which makes this project attractive is the fact that it plans to expand throughout all of Latin America and not only the big three Internet markets (Brazil, Mexico and Argentina). In addition, the founders and sponsors behind Certifica are Chilean and the company has already opened an office in Peru. There is also a major confluence of objectives in this area between IFC and the project sponsors, as Fundacion Chile is a non-profit development agency, and the project has had developmental objectives from its formation. IFC''s strategy in the Internet sector favours supporting infrastructure projects, with local entrepreneurs and partners. Certifica will provide a key component of Internet infrastructure for the region and it''s sponsors and founders are 100% local. As noted above, this project is quite unique in that it plans to expand simultaneously to countries other than the big three (Brazil, Mexico and Argentina), namely Chile and Peru where it is already operational and Colombia and Central America following the proposed financing round. IFC''s presence will reinforce the development aspects of this project since we are encouraging the Company to focus on the smaller Internet markets in the region.  IFC will also help to encourage further investment by other institutional investors, since the provision of venture capital to the region (though growing) is still limited, and Certifica will need to raise additional capital in order to complete its Latin America expansion.  In addition, most of the venture capital flowing to the region is going to companies in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. Chilean start-ups have had much more difficulty raising risk capital. The project sponsors also believe IFC''s participation will be valuable in political risk mitigation as the company expands into less developed and more politically unstable countries in the region.","","","","","","","","","","","This project is a category C project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedures.

Its local market share is estimated at 60-70% and the company presents high standards of quality and respect for deadlines. With the liberalisation of the scholar book editing sector a new market is offered to Graphique Industrie. However, today Graphique Industrie is limited in its production capacities and has to refuse a number of customers. For that purpose, the project consists of buying new machines, faster and technologically more advanced, so as to increase its volume of production and respond favourably to the local and regional demand.The project should lead to a significant increase in Graphique Industries volume of sales. The expected increase in turnover is 30% for the first year, 10% for the three following years and 5% for the remaining three years. This project should particularly benefit the educational system as editing and printing of scholar books, an activity previously strictly limited to the Ministry of Education, has from 1998 been authorised to any editing and printing company. Graphique Industrie should also increase significantly its volume of production in stationary products and help therefore reduce the volumes imported and sold by LPS, creating therefore supplemental added value in the country. IFC and Proparco will provide long-term financing to Graphique Industrie which is not otherwise available from the local capital market. In addition, IFC and Proparco will ensure that the project is implemented in an environmentally sound manner.","","","","","","","","","","","This is an environmental category B project.

The Sponsor has a proven track record in development of eco-toursim facilities and dedication to ecological study, development and conservation.  The Company has been offering eco- tourism experiences since the mid-1970s, initially with Cuzco Amazonico and more recently with the Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel.  The existing hotels are recognized internationally as locations for scientific research.  Furthermore, Inka Terra is in the process of offering ecological study programs that provide academic credit for accredited institutions in the United States.  Over the years, the Company has achieved the delicate balance necessary to operate a profitable business while fostering an environment that protects local nature and culture, as well as augmenting scientific studies and ecological awareness of the area.  Sr. Koechlin has also contributed significantly to the government''s efforts and awareness of environmental protection.The Project builds on IFC''s cultural heritage and tourism strategies.  At several sites, the Project will embody direct, proactive development of cultural heritage through several measures.  The project will contribute to the preservation, renovation and interpretation of Inka and Spanish Colonial cultural heritage into the tourist experience. Furthermore, the Project will facilitate the growth of cultural-heritage or nature related travel in a sustainable manner to several regions, including Machu Picchu, Amazonia, and the Andes (Lake Titcaca).  The development of higher quality lodging in such areas is expected to encourage increased visitation and, thus, economic benefit to the local areas.  The expansion of this Peruvian, private sector, small business will bring related positive impacts on local employment, local training, foreign exchange and tax revenue.  IFC Role:    Inka Terra does not have access to financing from traditional sources due to its limited size, specialized focus and related ecological undertakings.  Despite these limitations, the Company has built up an impressive record of sustainability and growth.  By supporting the Company, IFC will allow it to expedite the implementation of its strategy to build a network of eco-tourism lodges.  Such a network will enable the Company to offer a broader range of eco-tourism vacation packages and significantly increase its visibility vis-à-vis tour operators and the public in general.  This, in turn, will improve the Company''s financial performance and help it build a stronger financial structure for future growth.  IFC''s support for this project will also help to publicize the success of the concept, set physical standards for future investments and increase foreign exchange earnings for Peru.Development Impact:  Mr. Jose Koechlin and Inka Terra have shown that eco-tourism is an effective mechanism for balancing conservation and social development opportunities with commercial reality and demands.  The proposed Project will help them to build on their successful experiences in the Amazon and elsewhere in Peru.  By promoting sustainable tourism in a culturally and ecologically sensitive environment the Project could potentially have wider beneficial impacts through replication by others.  The Project is also expected to contribute to Peru''s tourism infrastructure by providing international standard accommodations in a variety of important tourist destinations throughout the country, thereby attracting more visitors, more foreign currency spending and more jobs.  Meanwhile, traditional culture and other natural elements will be preserved.  Additionally, the Company will upgrade its human capital by imparting professional training to its employees, and providing life style changing career paths in the hospitality industry.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityTown Hall, Puerto Maldonado, Peru; Town Hall, Aguas Calientes, Peru; other community postings will be determined as related projects become realized.","The Project sponsor is Inka Terra Peru, S.A.C., a private Peruvian company founded and 100% owned by Sr. Jose Koechlin.

The project consists of: (i) significantly increasing the production capacity, and adding new technologies, for printed circuit board (PCB) assembly, complex electronic sub assemblies, and testing; (ii) introducing double color and wider application plastic injection moulding; (iii) enhancing the capacity and technical capability of the tooling shop (""the project""). The existing operations in Bulgaria are only the initial phase of a much larger project, and do not realize the full potential of the facilities in Bulgaria to meet the current market demand growth. The company would benefit significantly from the investment, which would significantly broaden the technical scope and product range of the facilities and enable it to further strengthen the Group (includes the ponsors, and their affiliated companies) position in the global contract electronic manufacturing (CEM) market. EPIQ-EA is limited liability company, founded in 1997, registered in Botevgrad, Bulgaria with a share capital of 1,950,000 BGN, and wholly owned by EPIQ-NV, a public limited company registered in Tessenderlo, Belgium. Its production facility has 3,500 square meters production floor for module assembly and 1000 square meters for assembly, including clean room class 10000, and employs over 500 people. EPIQ EA is QS9000 (1999), VALEO 1000 (1998) and ISO 9002 (1998) certified.  XPEQT (formerly Sigma Delta - Bulgaria) is a limited liability company registered in September 2000 in Sofia, Bulgaria with an authorized share capital of 1,410,500 BGN. It is wholly owned by Sigma Delta Holding N.V. XPEQT specializes in manufacturing of test equipment, and in integrated circuit design and tool making. IFCs role in the proposed project is three-fold: (i) increase confidence in and support for the Governments privatization efforts; (ii) act as a catalyst for foreign investment and private sector participation in Bulgaria; and (iii) help the Sponsors gain access to long-term financing.By supporting a well managed Bulgarian production facility such as EPIQ EA, IFC would help encourage and enhance local production of high-tech devices in the electronic/semiconductor appliances manufacturing sector. The project is expected to generate significant number of new jobs along with having a spillover effect. Furthermore, it is envisaged that the appropriate terms and structuring of this investment would help encourage other lenders and investors to consider such other projects in Bulgaria. Another benefit of the proposed project to Bulgaria would be in the form of net foreign exchange earnings as the project is export oriented.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result, which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityThe environmental documents are available in Bulgarian language for review at the entrance of the company offices at Industrial Zone Microelectronika, 2140 Botevgrad, Bulgaria","The project companies are  XPEQT Ltd., established in 2000, and  EPIQ Electronic Assembly Ltd., established in 1997, both limited liability companies incorporated in Bulgaria.

Standard Chartered Bank will manage the PEDF by ensuring that Agreed Facility Drawdown documentations and procedures are in place.  The US$10 million facility, will provide trade and working capital financing through APW to SMEs that form a part of APW''s manufacturing network.  Under PEDF, IFC would provide Standard Chartered a partial credit guarantee of 50% on all facility drawdowns for a total exposure of up to US$5 million.APW is a trading company, based in Singapore, that sources purchase orders (PO) from international buyers and subcontracts production on the POs to the APW network, initially in the Philippines.  The APW network is comprised of SME manufacturers that are prequalified by APW based on detailed criteria including their experience, product quality, production reliability and environmental and social protection standards.  SMEs that are a part of the APW network benefit from APW''s marketing activities abroad as well as financing for pre-export activities such as raw material procurement and labor cost.  Moreover, the scale of the manufacturing network provides APW the requisite purchasing power to obtain volume discounts that were previously only available to larger manufacturers, and pass on such savings to the SMEs.  Currently, APW finances the manufacturer''s pre-export operations with its own equity.  However, as the production demand for APW-sourced products has grown, APW can no longer fund the SME''s growing financing needs with its equity base.  Therefore, APW approached Standard Chartered and IFC to establish a facility to provide the SMEs with appropriate financing to grow their businesses.PEDF will fill the existing credit gap between banking institutions and SMEs.  Because of IFC''s partial guarantee, the PEDF structure provides the necessary comfort for Standard Chartered to offer the facility to APW.  Through the PEDF, SME manufacturers that lack collateral, size or bank relationships can independently secure working capital and trade financing.  Ultimately, it is anticipated that the PEDF would result in increasing access to direct financing for the SMEs from either Standard Chartered or other lending institutions in the region.   IFC is also considering a small technical assistance program to help the SME network further improve its occupational safety and environmental standards.The PEDF, a Facility arrangement by IFC, Standard Chartered Bank and APW will be able to (i) help SMEs obtain much-needed working capital presently unavailable due to the SMEs'' size and lack of collateral  (ii) to increase SMEs'' market reach  via APW''s marketing channels (iii)  to create a conduit through which SMEs can benefit from volume raw material discounts and (iv) to demonstrate to local banks that such financing programs could be attractive options that could be compatible with their core operations.  With  IFC''s assistance, APW''s monitoring and control procedures are expected to professionalize the SMEs, promote greater transparency and establish satisfactory environmental and social norms in the SME workplace.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Financial Intermediary (FI) Type 2 project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure.

At present, the supply of locally sourced tissue paper is very limited in the Caricom region. The aim of the investment is to establish a local tissue paper source for the paper converters in Trinidad and the whole Caricom region.  The mill will use local and imported wastepaper and market pulp.  It will produce high quality parent jumbo paper rolls to be sold to local and regional downstream converters for the production of bath tissue, napkins, facial tissue, kitchen and industrial towels.  The mill is expected to start production in the early part of 2002.  Unicell will be the first, and only, wastepaper consumer in Trinidad and Tobago, thus having an important role in developing the region''s waste management system. The Project will also have a positive impact on the local converters efficiency and competitiveness, serving as a net import substitution for the area, and filling an important supply gap.IFC Role:Because the Sponsor is new to Trinidad and Tobago, the technology is unknown to local bankers and the Project is greenfield, the Sponsor would not have been able to raise the required financing from local sources.  IFC will provide long-term funds with a long grace period to cover start-up and initial market risks.  Moreover, IFC will have an important role to play in assisting to raise co-financing in local currency to help mitigate the Project''s currency exposure. Also, by including co-financing in the financial plan, IFC will assist the Sponsor in forming relationships with local and/or international banks operating in Trinidad and Tobago.  Finally, IFC will provide environmental oversight to ensure that the Project meets the World Bank Guidelines.Development Impact:The Project will provide a strong positive developmental impact in Trinidad and Tobago by creating jobs, helping to reduce paper pollution, and cleaning up the environment through wastepaper collection.  Less than 20% of the paper consumed in Trinidad and Tobago is collected given the lack of paper recycling facilities in the Caribbean region.  The Project will recycle wastepaper and give economic incentives to increase the collection capacity in Trinidad and Tobago and in most of Caricom.  Moreover, the region will benefit from the Group''s significant experience in wastepaper markets and in organizing its collection to improve the efficiency of collecting systems. Additionally, the Project will introduce state-of-the-art technology to Trinidad and Tobago and will disseminate new operating, marketing, maintenance, and management skills in the country.

It has a disbursed portfolio of over US$2 million with a repayment rate of 99% and serves nearly 20,000 active clients throughout Kyrgyz Republic.  FK is governed by FINCA''s Board of Directors.  From the outset, FK has adopted a commercial approach to microfinance.  It has 100% operational and financial self-sufficiency in recent years and some of the lowest levels of delinquency in the FINCA network, despite a difficult macroeconomic environment, while increasing the incomes of its borrowers. Purpose of Project:    In order to expand its outreach in the country and to institutionalize the activity on a more permanent basis, FK seeks to access commercial sources of funding.  To do so, the sponsor wants to convert FK into a regulated for-profit microfinance institution.  However, the legal framework for such an entity does not yet exist in Kyrgyz Republic.  An interim step is therefore proposed, whereby funding is put in place now on a commercial basis to expand FK''s activity without having to wait for the legal framework surrounding conversion to be addressed first.  Hence, IFC would make an equity investment of up to US$1 million to establish FINCA Microfinance Resource to support the lending operations of FINCA Kyrgyzstan during its transformation from a non-profit microfinance organization into a for-profit microfinance institution.  The Resource will be a closed-end, 3-year limited liability corporation, and will have a capital of up to US$2.5 million.  It will be managed by FINCA.  The funding would later be rolled into the equity of the new for-profit institution to provide part of its capital on its formation.  IFC Role and Development Impact:  During the last eighteen months, IFC and FINCA have explored various ways to support the conversion of FK into a commercial microfinance institution.  IFC provided technical assistance funding from IFC''s Trust Fund to support a market analysis that will be part of a detailed feasibility study for FK''s conversion.  Through this project, IFC in conjunction with FINCA, will provide FK with the necessary commercial funds as an interim step, in order to ensure that the expansion of the FINCA Kyrgyzstan''s program is not delayed.  During FK''s transformation,  IFC will play a catalytic role in facilitating communication with the Kyrgyz government authorities and the National Bank of Kyrgyzstan.IFC expects to become a founding shareholder in the new microfinance institution, and expects to help provide a sound basis for the corporate governance of the new microfinance institution.  IFC will also seek to attract other investors into the equity of the new microfinance institution. The proposed project will have a strong development impact as it supports the growth of a successful microfinance program, which aims at improving the standard of living of the poor.  As FINCA  has successful operations throughout the world, including extensive networks in Latin America and the NIS, the proposed project is expected to have a good replication potential to other commercially viable programs of FINCA, and have positive demonstration effect on other microfinance organizations.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category FI Type 1 project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.

Ispat Karmet SME Resource,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,Kazakhstan,TOO Mittal Steel SME Resource,Regional Industry MAS MCT,2000-11-28T05:00:00Z,2000-12-29T05:00:00Z,FI,Loan,"The Resource will be managed by Ispat Karmet.  The Resource will provide loan, quasi-equity, and equity financing, while the manager will provide technical and business assistance to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) located in Karaganda Oblast.  Target size of investments is $20,000 to $1million.The proposed Resource is specific in that it aims to stimulate the relationship between the large corporate sector (in this case, Ispat Karmet) and the private SME sector.  Specifically, IKR will target its investments primarily at SMEs that already are or have a good potential to become suppliers to Ispat Karmet, which is the largest steel producer in Kazakhstan.  This project is the result of IFC''s effort to identify a fully commercial and economically-sustainable model for strengthening SMEs affiliated with large international organizations in general, and with Ispat Karmet in particular. The concept of this Resource is based on an existing model: the Anglo-American SME funds, whereby Anglo-American of South Africa has provided financial, technical, and managerial support to enable local SMEs to become suppliers to its mines and businesses.  The Anglo-American initiatives have been successfully operating since 1989, substantially increasing supplies from local SMEs, and providing good financial returns on investment. IFC Role and Development Impact:  IFC''s primary role in this project is to promote corporate citizenship.  If successful, this project could have considerable replication possibilities as many large organizations working in developing environments, many of them IFC clients, have similar needs.  The proposed project has substantial development impact.  Important impediments to the development of the Kazakh SME sector include lack of access to equity capital, limited availability of long-term lending, and business managers insufficient business expertise and technical training.  The IKR aims to alleviate these constraints by providing financing supplemented by appropriate technical assistance. The project is consistent with the World Bank Group strategy to support the growth of the private sector in Central Asia.  In line with this strategy, IFC''s priorities for Central Asia include supporting SMEs through financial intermediaries as well as through corporate-sponsored financing.","","","","","","","","","","",This is a Category FI Type 2 project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.

The project will be developed in three phases.  Phase I of the project will involve: (i) land and infrastructure development of a 50 ha area on the Jordanian side, and (ii) construction of 94,000 m² of buildings, offices and factories for rent, on the Jordanian side, which are proposed to be partially financed by IFC. In addition, Phase I will include land and infrastructure development of 5 ha area on the Israeli side, and construction of a 700 m long bridge across the Jordan River, connecting the Jordanian and the Israeli sides of the estate, which will be funded by the Israeli sponsors under a separate legal entity. In the second and third phases, additional 105,000 and 97,000 m² will respectively be developed on the Jordanian side.  The implementation of subsequent phases, which are not IFC financed, will proceed in accordance with tenant demand, cash flow generation and project finance availability.The project will generate significant development impact as follows: - The project will facilitate creation of up to 15,000 skilled and semi-skilled jobs in Jordan where the unemployment rate is approximately 25%.  - The project will attract foreign investment from Israel, Europe, the U.S. and Asia and stimulate development of export-oriented industries.- The project will host hi-tech and other high value added industries, that would provide opportunities for technology transfer and improved utilization of Jordan''s skilled and educated workforce.  - The project will broaden the JRVs economic base and stimulate planned development of the JRV, as it is part of an integrated plan which includes provision of housing, education and training centers, development of complementary enterprises, and raising the standard of living of the population of the JRV. - The project will assist community development in the health and education sectors, and has attracted a major medical research institute (the King Hussein Research Center), affiliated with the world-renowned Sloan Kettering Medical Center. - The project can potentially broaden Jordan-Israeli economic cooperation and contribute to peace between the two countries. If successful, the project will create a demonstration effect that may stimulate other similar projects in the pegion.IFCs role in the project is as follows: - IFC has helped the sponsors structure the project and limit the scope to a reasonable level in Phase I, instead of pursuing open-ended development. - Given the project''s political dimension involving Jordan and Israel, IFC has served as a third-party facilitator. - IFC will help complete the financial plan through its own funds, and to the extent possible, mobilize funds from other investors, who, given the political risk, are unlikely to support the project without IFCs presence. - IFCs involvement has ensured that best environmental and social practices are followed. This includes changes in the project design as recommended in the Environmental and Social Assessment (ESIA) Reports, such as a different Israeli site, a different bridge design and careful planning of the estate area, so that the development impact of the project could be maximized. Due to IFCs involvement, an ESIA for a Jordanian project has been prepared and publicly released for the first time in the country. - Finally, IFCs involvement in the project will provide comfort to potential international and regional tenants given the unstable political situation in the region and help mitigate political risk perceived by potential tenants.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category A project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because it may result in significant adverse environmental and/or social impacts that are sensitive, diverse or unprecedented.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityThe locations of the Environmental and Social Assessment Reports for both the Jordanian and Israeli sides of the project are as follows:In Jordan:Environmental Protection Agency of the  Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs P.O.

"HSBC Tower Equity Partners, L.P.",Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Latin America Region,HSBC Tower II Equity Partners (Cayman) L.P.,Disruptive Technologies and Funds,2000-12-12T05:00:00Z,2000-01-22T05:00:00Z,FI,Equity,"Project DescriptonThe project involves establishing the HSBC Tower II Equity Partners L.P., a US$300 million target private equity fund, with an eight year life span, sponsored mainly by HSBC Argentina Holdings S.A. (HSBC). The project also involves establishing HSBC Private Equity (South America) Ltd. (the general partner) that will be majority owned by HSBC.  The fund will seek to generate superior returns from privately-negotiated equity investments in small to medium, privately held enterprises in the Mercosur region and neighboring countries that need capital and better management.  Investments will include development capital financing, venture capital financing, share purchases and acquisitions in a broad range of sectors.  The fund will invest in companies that have strong sector leadership and value appreciation potential through management, superior technology, market position and other competitive advantages.  The fund, with active financial and management support, will assist these high potential investees to grow with discipline into globally competitive and attractive companies through corporate governance, strategic planning and guidance, financial and operational supervision, formation of strategic alliances with local and foreign firms, mergers and acquisitions, and other strategies.  Development ImpactFirst, there is a major capital and financing constraint in the Mercosur region, and IFC can contribute to increase the flow of equity capital into the region for SMEs in need of financial and management support.  Scarcity of capital has also affected the private equity industry, and several initiatives have been delayed or put on hold.  Private equity funding will be critical to the fund''s rehabilitation and expansion efforts as Latin America recovers from the recent difficult economic and market environments and as these companies prepare for competition in globalized markets.  The fund will continue to help local SMEs become regionally and internationally competitive and also increase the number of enterprises eligible for public listing.  Second, this fund will allow IFC to continue to help develop the private equity industry in Argentina, and the Mercosur region.  IFC and the sponsor''s early relationship in private equity (Ropasa Sadicar) was innovative at the time and later gave way to a successful second fund (Tower Fund), which helped lead the way to a private equity ""industry"" in Argentina, which is deepened with the launch of this extension fund - HSBC Tower II Equity Partners L.P.  Third, this fund is expected to contribute to the local and regional economy by investing in and strengthening the operations of sustainable enterprises.  Lastly IFC''s investments in private equities in general is an effective investment vehicle that supports new and growing industries, provides cross border liquidity, serves as a platform for strategic alliances, and drives job creation and innovation.  Development Impact Evidence from the Tower Fund The success of the Tower Fund to date is evident from both a profitability and development viewpoint.  Most of the funds investments benefited from the introduction and/or improvement of the following:  international accounting, auditing, reporting and disclosure standards; corporate governance through the funds active participation in the Board of Directors; strategic planning, financing, and resource allocation; and most importantly, guiding SMEs to expand and compete globally.  As a result, the funds activities and investments have further helped to attract international investors into the local region.  IFC RoleIFC has many roles in this project.  First, IFC is one of the lead investors in the original Tower Fund, and will play an important anchor investor role to help the fund raising efforts currently underway for this extension fund by providing comfort to potential investors as it is questionable today whether potential investors would commit substantial amounts to the fund without the presence of high caliber institutions.  Second, IFC has an important role both in the structuring and governance of the fund and the fund manager, so that the interests of the sponsor and fund manager is best aligned with that of the investors.  IFC has stressed the IFC private equity lessons learned, and the sponsor has been responsive to concerns that have been identified and to incorporate best practices into legal provisions.  This cooperation will raise the funds chances for successful implementation and will help establish best practices in the regional markets.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a category FI Type 2 project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedure.

Currently, the market is serviced by one operator, Cable and Wireless Jamaica (CWJ).  Since CWJ entered the market in 1986 with the privatization of the state-controlled telephone company, it has enjoyed exclusive operating rights in both fixed and mobile services.  The introduction of competition is expected to lower tariffs, improve the quality of service and customer responsiveness, and expand access to telecommunication services to a broader segment of the Jamaican population.  IFC''s direct investment and the resultant competition would also help to raise the country''s relatively moderate penetration rates for mobile and fixed services of 6.5% and 20%, respectively.   Moreover, the introduction of competition for the first time is likely to increase telecommunications usage nation-wide, improving the efficiency of the business sector, and increasing the connections between Jamaica and the global community.Through its syndication, IFC''s investment would also provide Jamaica with access to international capital markets, giving comfort to potential investors that may otherwise have been wary to enter the market.

The project will address the country''s large demand for long-term equipment financing in the tourism, construction, transportation, and fishery sectors. This demand is also sparked by entrepreneurs who seek capital to generate self-employment opportunities as fishermen, transport operators for tourism industry, and construction equipment suppliers. MLC is expected to play a pivotal role in the Maldivian economy, diversifying the financial system and offering term finance.IFC''s role in this project is traditional in nature. By investing in MLC, IFC will pioneer the establishment and the development of the first professionally managed private leasing company in the Maldives. IFC has introduced a strong technical partner, NDB, one of the leading financial institutions in the region, to provide the essential know-how. MLC will in turn provide the much-needed long-term finance to the country key economic sectors. IFC plays also a catalytic role in this project: its presence is expected to help mobilize long term financing from some of the banks, provident funds, and insurance firms. IFC has also initiated discussions with the regulatory authorities to establish the legal and the regulatory framework to enable the provision of lease/asset financing in the Maldives. In summary, IFC''s participation in this first private sector company, alongside sound sponsors and strong technical partners, will set a high standard for the industry and at the same time encourage others to enter. In addition to create a new institution, this project will introduce, in the Republic of the Maldives, new technology, know-how and skills transfer. NDB is expected to bring into the Maldives international experience in marketing, structuring, accounting, and management. Also, the project is expected to contribute to industrial development, and contribute to employment generation in this small island economy.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Financial Intermediary (FI) type 1 project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure.

NDB was established in 1979 as the second development finance institution (DFI) in Sri Lanka. Originally a state-owned enterprise, NDB went through a major privatisation in 1993 with 61% of the shares sold to private investors. In 1997, a second round of privatisation brought down the direct government ownership to 7.33% (18% in aggregate for all government-controlled institutions). NDB is a publicly listed institution with a very diverse shareholding: nearly 65% of the shares are held by foreign institutions. It is listed on the Colombo stock exchange with a market capitalisation of US$55 million equivalent. As of June 30, 2000, NDB had an asset base of SLR 38,719 million (US$509 million equivalent) and equity of SLR 5,983 million (US$ 78.6 million equivalent).NDB is well known to IFC. In 1999, IFC Board (R-99193) approved a financing package of US$38.5 million to NDB consisting of: (i) a credit line of US$35 million for NDB; and (ii) a convertible loan of US$3.5 million. IFC and NDB long standing relationship dates back to 1985 when the two institutions guaranteed a debenture issue for Lanka Orix Leasing Company.  In addition, IFC also approved an equity investment of US$1.4 million for a 15% shareholding in a new private sector housing finance company, named NDB Housing Finance Limited, a joint venture with NDB and HDFC, India.  In 1992, the two institutions collaborated in setting up an asset management company, CKN Fund management.  In 1998, IFC and NDB co-guaranteed a debenture issue for a leasing company, Mercantile Leasing Limited (MLL), and in discussion with IFC, NDB has since become its largest shareholder.Maldives Transport and Contracting Company (Plc) Ltd.

The project would comprise the first attempt to resolve the Czech Republic''s large overhang of bad debt and it would help stimulate the development of the local financial market.Mobilization of a New Class of Investors. Notwithstanding the success of NPL sales in the US, Japan, and Italy, it has been, and will continue to be, difficult to attract international insitutional investors to participate in emerging market NPL sales. IFC''s participation in these projects would help attract a new class of international institutional investor to this asset class.Enhanced Credit Culture. Shifting NPLs from the government to the private sector, creates a credit culture where liens are enforced and borrowers are required to repay debts. Such credit culture would increase banks'' incentives to make new loans.IFC would have a strong role in the project as a honest broker and neutral partner. The Czech government could lose its appetite to support the terms of the bidding process and/or terms of the transaction, making it difficult to select an appropriate manager or to properly execute the asset management and disposition plan. IFC''s presence would provide support to the Czech government. Such support is crucial because of the highly politicized nature of large-scale government NPL disposition programs. By participating in the bidding process and in the NPL resolution program, IFC would provide the government with much needed support during this critical period of restructuring the Czech financial sector.","","","","","","","","","","","The project has been classified as Category FI Type 1 according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.

The circumstances of the project also mean that it will not be possible or appropriate for the Manager to cause such environmental issues to be completely corrected or remediated in the timescale required for liquidation of the portfolio''s assets.  Goldman Sachs will therefore undertake appropriate due diligence to ensure that such environmental risks are adequately identified, evaluated and managed during the project, including the commissioning of environmental audits on individual NPLs as required on a case-by-case basis.  Goldman Sachs will also provide IFC with regular reports on any environmental issues arising during implementation of the project.

Location of environmental documents In locally affected community","As part of a pilot program to resolve Konsolidacni Banka''s (KoB) US$10 billion portfolio of non-performing loans (NPLs), the Czech Government is auctioning US$500 million of KoB''s NPLs (the pilot portfolio), which primarily comprise loans collateralized by real estate and inventory. The government has qualified three bidders --Goldman Sachs, Lone Star and GE Capital-- to submit bids for the pilot portfolio on or before January 10, 2001. The winning bidder will, pursuant to an asset management and disposition plan, proceed to liquidate the pilot portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis.It is proposed that IFC participate in the Czech government''s sale of the pilot portfolio by providing up to US$20 million of finance to Goldman Sachs.  To participate in the significant upside potential of the structure, IFC would explore allocating a portion of its total exposure to the ""equity"" tranche alongside Goldman Sachs (i.e., up to US$5 million).Goldman Sachs has extensive experience in making principal investments in NPL portfolios in Brazil, France, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Thailand and the US. It was the first firm to structure an NPL securitization, Bank of America''s Kearney Street deal, which closed in 1992.  Moreover, its principal investments group is dedicated to purchasing NPL portfolios in Central and Eastern Europe and is currently focusing on portfolios in Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. Goldman has expressed an interest in working with IFC throughout the region. Archon, Goldman''s asset management subsidiary, has experience in managing over US$11 billion of NPLs world-wide. In addition, Goldman has an extensive debt distribution network, which IFC would access to syndicate this or future NPL financings. KoB is the Czech government''s institution for management, recovery and implementation of problematic assets. In 1991, the Czech government established KoB for the purpose of taking over those loans made on non-commercial terms that large banks inherited from the former economic system. Since then, KoB has directly undertaken other restructuring operations including the purchase of bad loans from state banks prior to their privatizations. Moreover, KoB has expanded its operations to include development finance activities and, as a commercial bank, accepting deposits and making loans to commercial customers.

In addition, a full disclosure meeting took place at the end of the EA process, just before the public release of the EIA.  Plata has been working with local residents in the project area since 1997, and there have been several meetings with the local and regional authorities as well as with local leaders.  The EIA was made available for public consultation in La Colorada and in the towns of Durango and Zacatecas in early June 2000.  The next public meeting will take place prior to construction. Public consultation and disclosure were held in accordance with Mexican and World Bank Group requirements.  The result of the consultations have been incorporated into the EIA and appended reports.Environment, Health and SafetyThis is the rehabilitation and expansion of an existing underground mine. Key environmental issues include: air and dust emissions, water resources and water quality, tailings impoundment, erosion control, solid and liquid waste management, handling and storage of hazardous materials, noise and visual impacts, and reclamation and closure.  Health and safety issues include mine safety, employee training, occupational health and safety, general housekeeping and fire prevention.The EIA includes a detailed project description, a review of the current environment, a detailed analysis of environmental effects, and a discussion on mitigation and monitoring.  The main impacts relate to atmospheric environment, water resources, and geotechnical. An analysis of alternatives is complete.The EAP defines the management, mitigation, monitoring and institutional measures that will be taken at the La Colorada Silver Project to eliminate adverse environmental effects and social impacts, offset them, or reduce them to acceptable levels.  It defines the specific actions that Plata will undertake to implement these measures and to document their environmental and social performance.  It presents Plata management commitments, a set of mitigation measures, detailed monitoring activities, and various management plans.  Detailed implementation schedules and cost estimates were developed with clear benchmarks.The principal mitigation measures include minimization of fugitive sources, improved dust  control, minimization of additional land disturbance, integrated water management, process solution and runoff control systems, timely reclamation of surface disturbances, engineering control measures for the tailings impoundment, and enforcement of adequate procedures regarding the preservation of the fauna and flora.Plata has agreed to prepare a detailed mine reclamation and closure plan (MRCP) and to set aside financial provisions over the life of the mine to implement it.  Plata will set aside in an escrow account $150,000 annually for mine closure and reclamation, as estimated in the preliminary MRCP.  This money will be used during and at the end of the operation for reclamation measures undertaken by Plata at the mine site.Plata has established sound company policies on health, safety, environmental and social issues.  Plata has organized its company structure to oblige all managers to take individual ownership for the health, safety, environmental and social programs under their jurisdiction.  The positions that will serve as the clearinghouse for all of the programs are the Environment Officer and the Safety Superintendent.  Both have direct line responsibility through the Project Manager and Managing Director to the Plata Board of Directors and direct access to the Pan American Board of Directors through the Vice President for the Environment.IFC also carried out a review of Pan Americans environmental practices and management.  Environmental and safety issues are integrated into all aspects and stages of their business activities.Pan American''s Sustainable Development ProgramThe mine is located in a remote area of Zacatecas, one of Mexico''s poorest states. With IFC assistance, Pan American will develop a social program that goes substantially beyond Mexican legal requirements and will support sustainable development in the local community. SEMARNAP and PROFEPA (the Mexican government agencies responsible for environmental monitoring and protection) support the Pan American program.  The main components of the program are described below.Environmental Previous operations at the mine have left waste rock and tailings on the surface with no controlled drainage from these areas.  Oxidation, generation of acidic conditions, and leaching of metals or other contaminants into the surrounding soils have significantly impacted the water quality in the area.  Seepage, runoff and sediment eroded during substantial rainfall events have flushed contaminants out of the wastes and carried them to the surface watercourses.  Currently, the water from La Colorada River shows quantities that exceed standards for chromium VI, lead, copper and iron. As part of its commitment to environmentally responsible mining, Pan American would work with IFC specialists to plan and implement a cleanup of historical tailings that have negative impacts on the water quality of the La Colorada River.  Similarly, Pan American will improve the community wastewater treatment plant by creating a state of the art solid waste management facility.  The current sewage treatment system does not adequately treat wastes prior to discharge into La Colorada River.  This has negative environmental and social impacts due to agricultural use downstream of the facility. As part of the development plan, the water system will be monitored in order to assess the downstream social impacts from mine water discharge to La Colorada River. SocialMineral extraction and beneficiation represent the largest percentage of household income in the Zacatecas State (15%), followed by food retailing (8%). The state is therefore highly dependent on ongoing mining development for its economic and social wellbeing. Approximately 35,000 people live in the surrounding areas of the mine and a significant proportion of them have traditionally been dependent, directly or indirectly, on the mine and now suffer from severe unemployment and sharply reduced incomes.  Local residents have an average income of US $2.60/day and have been forced into seasonal migration to supplement meager agricultural earnings.  In the immediate area of the mine, small-scale farming has developed to service the mines and provides means of subsistence to the families involved in this activity. However, migrant farm labor has increased due to the poor performance of the mine and most men currently travel for large parts of the year, living away from their families and communities. Migration to the major city, Zacatecas, provides little relief as average earnings of employees fell by approximately 20% since 1994, following the signing of NAFTA and the ""Peso Crisis"". The project will have a net beneficial impact on the communities in the local town of Sombrerete and in the surrounding villages of La Colorada, Chalchihuites, Ranchera, Canoas, and San Juan de la Tapia. The expanded La Colorada operation and potential local economic development program will provide jobs and income generating opportunities in this economically depressed area. The mine will employ approximately 250 persons directly. However, research on mining economies has indicated that each additional job in mining supports approximately 5 jobs indirectly. In this region, each worker can support five or more persons, and thus La Colorada mine could potentially impact the lives of over 4,500 people (over 12% of the population of the Chalchihuites region).In order to maximize the impact of the mine on local employment, Plata will preferentially hire residents of the surrounding communities. The recruitment program includes a training component to teach mining skills to the local population.In addition, Pan American will work with the local community and other stakeholders to promote local economic development opportunities by developing local suppliers. In the first phase of the Project, it is expected that local contractors would provide the catering and transportation services. Further opportunities would exist for local supplier development in areas such as security, maintenance, contract mining, cleaning, small fabrication shops (e.g. welding), electrical services, and storage facilities.The Mining Department and SME Department is jointly developing a SME program for the area that would foster linkage between the project an","The project sponsor is Pan American Silver Corp (Pan American), a silver mining company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.

Plata has organized its company structure to oblige all managers to take individual ownership for the health, safety, environmental and social programs under their jurisdiction.  The positions that will serve as the clearinghouse for all of the programs are the Environment Officer and the Safety Superintendent.  Both have direct line responsibility through the Project Manager and Managing Director to the Plata Board of Directors and direct access to the Pan American Board of Directors through the Vice President for the Environment.IFC also carried out a review of Pan Americans environmental practices and management.  Environmental and safety issues are integrated into all aspects and stages of their business activities.Pan American''s Sustainable Development ProgramThe mine is located in a remote area of Zacatecas, one of Mexico''s poorest states. With IFC assistance, Pan American will develop a social program that goes substantially beyond Mexican legal requirements and will support sustainable development in the local community. SEMARNAP and PROFEPA (the Mexican government agencies responsible for environmental monitoring and protection) support the Pan American program.  The main components of the program are described below.Environmental Previous operations at the mine have left waste rock and tailings on the surface with no controlled drainage from these areas.  Oxidation, generation of acidic conditions, and leaching of metals or other contaminants into the surrounding soils have significantly impacted the water quality in the area.  Seepage, runoff and sediment eroded during substantial rainfall events have flushed contaminants out of the wastes and carried them to the surface watercourses.  Currently, the water from La Colorada River shows quantities that exceed standards for chromium VI, lead, copper and iron. As part of its commitment to environmentally responsible mining, Pan American would work with IFC specialists to plan and implement a cleanup of historical tailings that have negative impacts on the water quality of the La Colorada River.  Similarly, Pan American will improve the community wastewater treatment plant by creating a state of the art solid waste management facility.  The current sewage treatment system does not adequately treat wastes prior to discharge into La Colorada River.  This has negative environmental and social impacts due to agricultural use downstream of the facility. As part of the development plan, the water system will be monitored in order to assess the downstream social impacts from mine water discharge to La Colorada River. SocialMineral extraction and beneficiation represent the largest percentage of household income in the Zacatecas State (15%), followed by food retailing (8%). The state is therefore highly dependent on ongoing mining development for its economic and social wellbeing. Approximately 35,000 people live in the surrounding areas of the mine and a significant proportion of them have traditionally been dependent, directly or indirectly, on the mine and now suffer from severe unemployment and sharply reduced incomes.  Local residents have an average income of US $2.60/day and have been forced into seasonal migration to supplement meager agricultural earnings.  In the immediate area of the mine, small-scale farming has developed to service the mines and provides means of subsistence to the families involved in this activity. However, migrant farm labor has increased due to the poor performance of the mine and most men currently travel for large parts of the year, living away from their families and communities. Migration to the major city, Zacatecas, provides little relief as average earnings of employees fell by approximately 20% since 1994, following the signing of NAFTA and the ""Peso Crisis"". The project will have a net beneficial impact on the communities in the local town of Sombrerete and in the surrounding villages of La Colorada, Chalchihuites, Ranchera, Canoas, and San Juan de la Tapia. The expanded La Colorada operation and potential local economic development program will provide jobs and income generating opportunities in this economically depressed area. The mine will employ approximately 250 persons directly. However, research on mining economies has indicated that each additional job in mining supports approximately 5 jobs indirectly. In this region, each worker can support five or more persons, and thus La Colorada mine could potentially impact the lives of over 4,500 people (over 12% of the population of the Chalchihuites region).In order to maximize the impact of the mine on local employment, Plata will preferentially hire residents of the surrounding communities. The recruitment program includes a training component to teach mining skills to the local population.In addition, Pan American will work with the local community and other stakeholders to promote local economic development opportunities by developing local suppliers. In the first phase of the Project, it is expected that local contractors would provide the catering and transportation services. Further opportunities would exist for local supplier development in areas such as security, maintenance, contract mining, cleaning, small fabrication shops (e.g. welding), electrical services, and storage facilities.The Mining Department and SME Department is jointly developing a SME program for the area that would foster linkage between the project an","","","","",10326,"",BF - Silver,"","","",""
