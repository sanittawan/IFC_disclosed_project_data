Wienco Liberia,Investment,Environmental Documents,Active,Africa,Liberia,WIENCO LIBERIA LTD,Regional Industry - MAS Africa,2015-01-12T05:00:00Z,"",B,Other,"IFC is considering a blended finance solution to provide long-term financing to Wienco Liberia to support its: (i) capital expenditure including the construction of warehouses in up-country Liberia and (ii) pre-harvest financing of fertilizers and other agricultural inputs for small farmers. Both of which will increase access to inputs and access to storage facilities for smallholder cocoa farmers.  Wienco Liberia is engaged in the import and distribution of high quality fertilizers and agro chemicals for cocoa trees in Liberia, as well as the purchase and export of dry cocoa beans from smallholder farmers.  As the Company expands its operations with farmer cooperatives it will need a larger network of warehouses for cleaning, grading and storage of the crops. Warehouses would help reduce post-harvest losses and provide access to market to small farmers thereby increasing Wienco's overall control on the farmers' revenues flow and the repayment rate of the pre-harvest financing. Wienco Liberia plans to build 6 large warehouses up-country, in the cocoa producing regions, over the next 3 years. Supported by training and product development, Wienco Liberia is partnering with Cocoa Lela Association to provide agricultural inputs to farmers on a reliable, timely and efficient basis so to improve productivity of smallholder farmers and increase their income. Small farmers from the same village form groups of 8-12 members each and co-guarantee each other within the group. Input packages are given by Wienco Liberia to farmers on credit and payment for the same is made in kind through the delivery of an equivalent value of dry cocoa beans through the harvest season. It is expected that the project will reach up to 7,500 farmers in the next 5 years from its current base of 1,500 farmers and increase their cocoa yields from 750 kilos per hectare to 2,250 kilos per hectare.","","","","Wienco (the 'Company') is a leading supplier of agricultural inputs (predominantly fertilizers and crop protection products) to cocoa, maize and cotton growers with headquarters in Ghana and operations Liberia. The Company imports chemicals from internationally known companies (e.g. Bayer and Syngenta) and distributes them to customers (distributors and directly to estates and to small holder organizations) who collect them from Wienco warehouses using their own or contracted transporters. In Ghana a small volume of fertilizers is also supplied directly to organized commercial concerns (e.g. the Ghana Oil Palm Development Corporation) and the Company is a major supplier to Cocobod, Ghana's national cocoa board (http://www.cocobod.gh). The Company also buys some agricultural commodities and distributes or exports them.The Company supports and works closely with grower associations within Ghana, notably Cocoa Abrabopa and Masara N'Arziki. Ostensibly originally set up to provide markets for agro chemicals, these organizations have evolved (with management input and financial support from Wienco, such as financing packages for farmer groups) to varying states of autonomy and sophistication (e.g. regarding commodity certifications and traceability). In Liberia, the Company is partnering with a farmer association named Cocoa Lela Association (CLA), a non-profit organization established in 2011, to increase its provision of fertilizers and agrochemicals to cocoa farmers within the association. CLA works with farmers in three cocoa regions: Bong, Nimba and Lofa. The association currently rents 5 warehouses in the regions and 1 warehouse in the Monrovian port, and currently has 1,500 farmers within the association. Wienco Liberia is expected to reach 7,500 farmers through CLA by 2019.  Ghana Cocoa Abrabopa Association (CAA, 2008 Ghana) and Liberia Cocoa Lela (CLA, 2011 Liberia) are both shareholders of Ascot Amsterdam BV which was established in 2012 and is the dedicated sales office of CAA and CLA following the same standards, policy and procedures. The financial support received from Wienco and the evolution of these organizations to become raw materials suppliers to the Company (for example, members of Masara N'Arziki now sell maize directly to Wienco) requires them to be appraised alongside the Company's main business activity of agricultural input distribution. The grower association model is currently being replicated in the cotton sector in the north of Ghana and in the cocoa sector in Liberia; therefore, understanding Wienco's business development model regarding the creation and support of farmer associations (particularly the one centered on cocoa production) is an important indicator of its environmental and social (E&S) risk assessment and management framework, including those organizations supplying maize and cotton to the Company.  IFC therefore conducted a field appraisal of Wienco headquarters in Accra, and warehouse facilities and operations in Tema and Tamale in 2012. In addition, the IFC team met with agricultural (maize, cocoa and cotton) associations in Tamale and Dunkwa. Given current health alert in Liberia no field appraisal has been done and due diligence was undertaken through desk review of external reports and information provided by Wienco Liberia.","","","","","","","","","","","","This investment is classified as a Category B project in accordance with IFC's Policy on Environment and Social Sustainability. Based on information reviewed by IFC, this investment will have limited adverse E&S impacts that are few in number, are generally site specific, largely reversible and readily addressed through mitigation measures, as outlined in the Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) attached to this ESRS. The main E&S issues include the development and implementation of an integrated environmental and social management system (ESMS), commensurate to risks, that makes references to all appropriate regulations and requirements including those related to occupational health and safety of workers and contractors performing duties in Company operations, including warehouses and transportation. Wienco will ensure commercialized agrochemical products follow: (i) WHO recommendations of use, handling and disposal; (ii) WHO Class 1a and 1b formulations are banned; (iii) WHO Class 2 formulations are only used with appropriate controls; and (iv) farmers are trained on basic OHS aspects of agrochemicals commercialized.

BFSL, which is currently registered as an NBFC-MFI is Indias largest microfinance institution in terms of number of borrowers and portfolio outstanding. BFSL is headquartered in Kolkata, West Bengal with a borrower base of more than 6.1 million women borrowers and a loan portfolio of approximately INR78,100 million (US$1.3 billion equivalent).The proposed project intends to support the transformation of Bandhan to become a universal bank focused on low income households. Bandhan, by transforming into a Bank proposes to expand and diversify its operations to include a range of products such as savings, remittances, payments etc. and proposes to gradually build one of the finest micro, retail and SME banking platforms in the country with a specific focus on the under-banked population.","","","","","",1.	Access to Microfinance: This Project will help in expanding the outreach of access to microfinance to borrowers who have little or no access to formal sources of financing. 2.	Balanced growth of Microfinance: This Project will promote a more balanced growth of microfinance in India by increasing access to savings services for low income households and enable a wider range of credit products which could increase asset creation and job creation (through higher ticket loans for scaling up businesses) and increase access to housing and education finance.,"","","1.

With the start of banking operations, the entire micro-finance portfolio will be transferred to the Bandhan bank. The bank will continue to have majority of its exposure to the micro-enterprise and micro-finance portfolio, while new credit products will be launched. Over a period of time, the microfinance exposure will gradually reduce but will continue to lead the portfolio mix. The new credit products expected to be launched are low-medium risk products such as gold loan, home loan, commercial vehicles and equipment, agri loans, fisheries, education loans etc. Some of these are already existing products in the micro-enterprise portfolio of Bandhan MFI but the ticket sizes will increase going forward. In medium to long term, the bank also expects to get into corporate lending, although that is expected to constitute a very small part of the loan book at any given time. Overall, the existing and proposed lending portfolio present potentially limited adverse environmental or social risks or impacts that will be few in number, generally site-specific, largely reversible, and readily addressed through mitigation measures. Hence, the E&S risk of the proposed investment is medium and the project is categorized as FI-2. The applicable Performance requirements will be i) the IFC- FI Exclusion List; and ii) The host country E&S laws and regulations. The application of IFC Performance Standards to the loan portfolio will not be an immediate requirement and will be reassessed once the bank launches corporate/project lending.","","Main E&S risk and impacts of the project emanates from the MSME financing product that the bank is expected to launch at the start of operations. The key E&S risks of such lending products primarily involve management of labour and contractor workforce, occupational health and safety and waste management. In long term the bank is expected to get into medium risk corporate lending such as working capital finance and wholesale banking. However, the overall exposure to corporates is expected to remain low.As part of existing relationship with IFC, Bandhan has developed an E&S management system which currently addresses the low risk MFI portfolio. Going forward the bank will be required to upgrade the system to address E&S risks of MSME lending and corporate lending. The bank will also develop an external communication policy as per IFC Performance Standard 1.In the process of restructuring, Bandhan has repositioned some of its staff in the core banking operations while majority of the staff will be in general banking operations handling the existing MFI portfolio. Bandhan has witnessed a smooth transition on this account and there have been no grievances in the process.","","

HanKore), is incorporated in Bermuda and listed on the main board of the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX U9E). CEWL focuses on water and environmental protection industries in China. In June 2014 China Everbright Water Holdings Limited (CEWHL), a wholly owned subsidiary of China Everbright International Limited (CEI), entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement with HanKore to sell the entire issued and paid-up capital of China Everbright Water Investment Limited (CEWIL) to HanKore for a total consideration of RMB5.81 billion (approx. US$94.6 million). The transaction was closed on December 12, 2014, and the enlarged HanKore was renamed to CEWL.After the completion of this acquisition, CEWL engaged with strategic investors including IFC and proposed to issue common shares through private placement and applied for debt financing to support its restructuring and future growth.","","","","","PS1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks and ImpactsKey environmental and social issues include:  environmental and social management system; quality and sustainability of water resources; emissions to the environment water and subsurface; community and occupational health and safety; energy use and efficiency; community engagement; and land acquisition. Performance of the companys existing environmental and social management system is consistent with IFC PS requirements in providing adequate oversight, comprehensive risk assessment, monitoring, reporting and training. As the company grows its portfolio of water and wastewater assets, including the acquisition of the Hankore assets, CEWL will continue to manage its environmental and social performance per IFC PS and applicable World Bank Group EHS guidelines, and implement specific mitigation, monitoring and management measures outlined in the respective ESIAs for each site, and IFC PS requirements.Local governments select locations for project sites, and obtain documented approval from the impacted communities for location of such facilities. Consistent with the PRC laws and requirements, ESIAs are prepared by the company for projects and approved by the government. The impact assessment process includes detailed assessment of potential environmental and social impacts, as well as extensive consultation on various aspects of the project  from site selection, land acquisition through conditions for project operation, monitoring and reporting. Through the impact assessment process the government ensures that potential impacts of the project are identified and addressed during the project planning stage, and are used to prepare specific environmental control plans containing identified mitigation measures. The company''s obligation in the concessions is to comply with the requirements set forth in concession documents. The companys environmental management team has overall responsibility for obtaining appropriate permits and approvals from various government agencies, and ensuring all operations are consistent with the terms of the concession agreement. The ESIA process undertaken by the company is consistent with IFC PS1 requirements.CEWL has a robust corporate management system which provides some oversight of environmental, social, health and safety (ESHS) issues. Among other things, this ensures the operations comply with all applicable laws and regulations. The existing management system includes a series of procedures, work instructions, and reference documents which, when combined with the findings of the project-specific assessments, comprise a program of mitigation and performance improvement measures and actions necessary to effectively manage the E&S risks and impacts of its projects. For new projects, assessments are periodically aggregated and summarized for senior management review.  And through management meetings and written documents, project and site managers periodically report on environmental, health and safety performance, as well as accidents and incidents on existing projects.The companys management program includes operational policies and procedures that are implemented at the facility level by supervisors who report to management on an as needed basis. Policies and procedures comply with applicable local regulatory requirements for operation of these facilities including those for human resources and labor, occupational health and safety, and environmental compliance. The Vice President, Human Resources has responsibility for overseeing matters related to labor, working conditions and health and safety. The company provides professional training to key personnel to ensure they have relevant skills and adequate training to perform their work.  Assisted by qualified personnel, project managers for each project company are responsible for day-to-day implementation of project-level programs and plans.  In accordance with the project-specific work plans, project or site managers are responsible for providing environmental and health and safety training to employees, including contractor personnel. The company monitors environment, health and safety performance for each project according to the procedures established in their existing management system. In addition to standard procedures detailed in the existing management system, project specific procedures are developed to comply with provisions contained in E&S impact assessments and concession agreements with local governments. For example certain identified major environmental, health and safety risks and impacts, measurable targets are established as compliance benchmarks.  If monitoring results indicate nonconformance with standards or deviations from established benchmarks, appropriate corrective or preventive actions are initiated. A similar approach is adopted for unplanned events such as accidents where the events are investigated, and corrective or preventive actions initiated to prevent recurrence.As the company continues to grow, it will augment its management capacity by assigning additional staff and resources to provide oversight of its environmental and social performance. Responsibility for the management of environment, health, safety and social performance is currently assigned to a senior level staff within the water arm reporting to its CEO.  The individual has overall responsibility for strategies, policies, standards, compliance, and management initiatives related to environmental and social matters, and for ensuring adequate resources are made available.  The ESMS will explicitly make reference to the IFC Performance Standards (PS), and include a series of procedures, work instructions, and reference documents which, when combined with the findings of the EIAs, comprise a program of mitigation and performance improvement measures and actions necessary to effectively manage the E&S risks and impacts of its projects consistent with the PS.  Covering construction and operation, procedures will describe how relevant activities are managed, controlled and documented, and assign responsibility to job functions.PS2: Labor and Working ConditionsCurrently the company employs about 1,000 persons directly, while the number of sub-contracted employees can vary significantly depending on construction activities at any given time. The company has a Human Resources policy that complies with local and PRC regulatory requirements, and is applied consistently to all direct employees across all its business lines and (subsidiary) project companies. As required by law, the policy is included in employment contracts, and addresses working conditions, terms of employment, and wages and benefits. This information is provided in the form of an employee handbook at the time of induction. As is common practice in China, although not explicitly stated, employment relationships recognize the principals of non-discrimination and equal opportunity. Although there is no union at the company, under PRC law, employees have the right to freedom of association and have the opportunity to collectively represent to the management any issues or grievances that they may have. The minimum employment age at the company is 18 years. The company ensures that child labor or forced labor is not employed directly or by subcontractors through verification of relevant documents. Working hours on site can vary by nature of activity and phase of project, with most labor intensive phases being at the construction phase during which there are continuous operations.  Construction activity is largely subcontracted for which unskilled labor is procured locally. Regulatory requirements in PRC do not require the company to provide direct oversight of wages, working or living conditions of subcontracted labor. Wages are paid by subcontractors to labor on a monthly basis and calculated with basis on the hours worked, inclusive of overtime. Terms of employment for sub-contractors are as per PRC laws and the company relies on regulatory agencies for ensuring that sub-contractors comply with applicable labor laws. Moving forward, the company will review its human resources policy to ensure consistency with IFC Performance Standard 2 on labor, working and living conditions for any labor employed by the company, either directly or through sub-contractors. Human resources are managed at corporate level with oversight of the company facilities and operations. Training of staff is done on a routine basis in compliance with local workplace regulations. The department of human resources is responsible to ensure that all employees are adequately trained to perform their work safely. Supervisors monitor that standards are met and any reportable incidents are reported and follow up action taken when required. Training, monitoring and reporting framework is consistent with PRC requirements, and is expected to be consistent with IFC requirements after implementation of the ESMS program.Occupational health and safety of employees at the company is managed by the Human Resources and Administration. There is a plan for accident prevention and worker safety consistent with local regulatory requirements. All employees in the company have to undergo a training program at induction and subsequently regarding worker health and safety relevant to their job activity. Facilities are audited yearly by regulatory agencies to monitor compliance with labor regulations. The company has been in compliance with regulatory requirements and has recorded no significant lost time incidents or fatalities in its operational history. Although the company has been in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, there is variance between compliance requirements under regulatory obligations when compared to IFC Performance Standard 2 and Guidelines on Occupational Health and Safety (OHS)","1.	The Project is expected to strengthen China''s water sector and improve access to reliable waste water treatment services through newly created capacity as well as by raising discharge standards in CEWL''s plants. By reducing the volume of untreated wastewater discharged, the Project is expected to reduce environmental pollution of local water courses and reduce health risks to the local population.  The Project will also improve water efficiency by promoting wastewater recycling for industrial usage in regions experiencing water scarcity, such as Shandong province.  Significant new construction jobs are expected to be created as new capacity is built and brought into operation and existing facilities are upgraded. The Project will also have significant upstream and downstream supply linkages as CEWL expands its services to wastewater reuse and sludge treatment, which can benefit private industrial players.","","","The proposed investment in CEWL, one of the leading water companies in China, exemplifies IFC''s strategy in China and the water sector by helping CEWL to expand its activities in China''s waste water, water re-use, and sewage treatment sector and to create environmental and health benefits, and by supporting CEWL in its commitment to best international environmental and social and corporate governance standards.","","","CEWLs largest shareholder is China Everbright Water Holdings Limited (CEWHL) with approximately 74.4% of the shareholding.

The key objective of ARF is to construct a portfolio of small business investments diversified across low-income countries in Central and Eastern Africa, which collectively capture the underserved SME and FCS investment segment in those two regions. The Fund will seek to provide (i) risk capital and (ii) management guidance to small businesses in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Burundi and Uganda. ARF will continue the business model established by the Central African SME Fund, which has had a business model that has achieved proof of concept, demonstrated by (i) establishment of a functional effective team; (ii) sourcing of a healthy pipeline of investments; (iii) execution and value addition; and (iv) the Fund Manager making four cash distributions to investors to date. CASF has managed to achieve this even with the significant setback brought on by the political disorder in CAR, and the Fund Manager has proven the ability to ring-fence investments and safeguard capital in such environment, a critical ability for a FCS investor.","","","","","","-	Access to finance for SMEs: The Fund is expected to provide much needed equity and quasi-equity financing to at least 25 SMEs in Central Africa to support their growth and expansion. -	Job Creation: The Fund is expected to generate employment in low-income communities (as confirmed by pipeline investments in the health, education and agriculture sectors) and help support over 8,000 direct jobs from its investee companies and investments ranging from $250,000 to $5 million. Job creation impact is being demonstrated by CASF, which has generated 450 new jobs over a 4-year period from its 26 investments ranging from $100,000 to $500,000.-	Private Sector Development: The Fund is expected to promote sustainable growth in companies that have very little or no access to other sources of capital. Further, there will be significant value add to the portfolio companies through capacity building, improved ESG, as well as operational and financial expertise through a technical assistance facility that ARF is raising for investee and prospective SME companies.-	Poverty Alleviation: All target countries with the exception of Uganda, are fragile and low-income countries. IFC's investment will have impact in supporting business growth and generating job income.-	Expansion of Financial Markets in Central Africa: the Fund's successful investments and exits are expected to help develop a new asset class and provide much needed long term capital financing for high-growth SMEs in these markets.","","","-	Catalytic Role: By investing in CASF, the first PE fund in DRC and CAR with a first-time fund manager, IFC played a catalytic role both developing a PE model tailored for these markets, and paving the way for the development of a PE ecosystem in these countries. Supporting ARF will provide a continuation of the same catalytic support in nascent PE markets in Central Africa, mobilizing other investors and creating access to finance for at least another 20 high-growth SMEs in the region.<br>-	Demonstration Effect: IFC investing in ARF will act as a signal to the investor community that frontier and fragile markets, specifically those in Central Africa, are viable markets for risk and growth capital. This is also expected to unlock and expand the range of financing mechanisms and amounts of capital for local SMEs which have limited funding options and as a result have limited growth opportunities. IFC's investment in the Fund will also allow these first-time fund managers to ""graduate"" from the SME Ventures program and become potentially sustainable. The Program is designed to develop PE funds and first time fund managers in target frontier markets by providing a mix of investment plus non-traditional IFC advisory and grant funding at the macro, intermediary and micro level to support their development. <br>-	IFC Performance Standards: IFC's investment will assist in establishing ARF in accordance with IFC standards for governance, environmental and social standards. IFC will also continue to assist in transmitting these standards across ARF's investee companies, as it is currently being done through CASF. The fund manager already as an established Environmental and Social Management System in place with an ESG coordinator, has ESG integrated into its investment processes and provides ESG training to all its investment managers through an IFC ESG course.","","","The Fund will be managed by XSML Capital Limited ('XSML') as a Mauritius registered company focused on providing growth equity, quasi-equity and medium to long term lending instruments to SMEs in Central Africa. XSML, and its local operating subsidiaries in Kinshasa (DRC) and Bangui (CAR), is composed of 10 investment professionals with experience in arranging of, investing in and managing Central African corporate financing. The investment team will be responsible for deal origination and structuring, value creation and exits, and is the same core investment team that added value in the Central African SME Fund.","The Fund has a target equity investment of up to US$50 million, of which IFC expects to invest up to US$10million in equity, not to exceed 20% of total committed capital.",10.0 million (USD)<table><tr><th>Product Line</th><th>IFC Investment (million USD)</th></tr><tr><td>Risk Management</td><td></td><tr><td>Guarantee</td><td></td><tr><td>Loan</td><td></td><tr><td>Equity</td><td>10.0</td></table><br>* These investment figures are indicative,"The Fund will be established in Mauritius as a limited life company with limited liability.

Pan African,Investment,Environmental Documents,Active,Africa,Tanzania,PANAFRICAN ENERGY TANZANIA LTD,Regional Industry - INF Africa,2015-02-05T05:00:00Z,"",B,Other,"PanAfrican Energy Tanzania Limited (PAET or the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Orca Exploration Group Inc., a TSX Venture Exchange listed company. PAET operates the Songo Songo natural gas field consisting of four producing wells and three suspended wells; a processing plant; and ancillary infrastructure which includes pipelines, a warehouse for materials storage, a fully serviced and catered accommodation camp for operations personnel, a water treatment plant, wastewater and sewage treatment facility, vehicles and small lifting equipment for operational use, and a jetty and roll-on roll-off landing site. The Songo Songo gas field is located onshore and offshore Songo Songo Island, approximately 20 km off the coast of Tanzania and 200 km south of the countrys largest city, Dar es Salaam. The field contains an estimated 1.7 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of original gas in place, and has been on production since 2004. The gas produced from the Songo Songo gas field is processed at a gas processing plant on Songo Songo Island and then transported via a 25 km 12-inch offshore pipeline and a 207 km16-inch onshore pipeline to Dar es Salaam, where the gas is delivered to independent power producer, Songas Limited (Songas), the state power utility, Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO), and some 38 private industrial companies in Dar es Salaam via a low pressure gas distribution system. Songas owns two of the current producing wells, the gas processing plant at Songo Songo, and the pipeline from Songo Songo to Dar es Salaam, which it also operates. The four operating wells currently produce approximately 92 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscfd) of natural gas. Of this production, up to 45 MMcfd is dedicated to the national oil company, Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC). This portion, which is referred to as Protected Gas, is produced at no cost, no profit by PAET and sold by TPDC under contract to Songas. Once purchased by Songas, the Protected Gas is mainly used for generation of the bulk of electricity at the 180 MW Ubungo power plant in Dar es Salaam. The electricity produced at Ubungo power plant is sold by Songas to TANESCO. The gas produced by PAET from Songo Songo currently supplies approximately 60% of the power generated in Tanzania.All gas produced in excess of the Protected Gas is termed Additional Gas. The rights to develop, produce, market and sell Additional Gas is governed by a Production Sharing Agreement between the Government of Tanzania, TPDC and PAET signed in 2001. Additional Gas is currently sold by PAET to (i) Songas, to supply the remainder of the gas used by the Ubungo power plant not covered by Protected Gas; (ii) TANESCO, to supply additional power generation facilities at Ubungo (102MW), Tegeta (45MW) and Symbion (112MW); (iii) the TPCC-owned Wazo Hill Cement Plant, a major industrial consumer; and 37 other smaller industrial customers in Dar es Salaam under stand-alone agreements.The IFC investment will support PAETs proposed Songo Songo expansion project. The expansion project consists of the work-over of existing suspended production wells, a new development well and associated platform, flow-line to connect the well to the gas processing plant as well as the installation of a process refrigeration unit at the plant. Well work-overs are contemplated to be performed on the two offshore suspended wells, plus one offshore producing well. The well work-over program is scheduled for Q3 2015/Q1 2016. Inasmuch as the work-overs of the suspended wells in particular are considered to be possible, engineering and feasibility studies will be undertaken prior to the work-overs. The workovers, if successful, will use the existing infrastructure (platform and flow-lines). Should the work-overs be deemed unfeasible or prove to be unsuccessful during the workover operation, it is expected that the wells will be either side-tracked or abandoned and new wells drilled to replace the old wells. The surface location for the new well is located just offshore Songo Songo Island, between SS-5 and SS-7. Drilling is currently planned as part of the offshore program for Q4 2015. The offshore program activities, which include the drilling of one new development well and three work-overs of existing producing and suspended wells, are expected to take up to six months including mobilization, drilling operations, well testing and demobilization. Drilling is planned to be done using a shallow draft jack-up or pole barge offshore drilling rig which will be installed by a drilling contractor yet to be identified. The rig will be self-contained in providing accommodation and catering, as well as housing plant and equipment for drilling. All activities involved in the offshore drilling of the new development well will be conducted to good international industry practices and conventional natural gas well drilling scheduling, procedures and practices. Assuming successful and commercially viable, the well will be equipped with a flow-line to the gas processing plant. If for some reason the well is not commercially viable, the well will be abandoned and all materials cleared from the site.After implementation, the project is expected to increase the natural gas production at the Songo Songo gas field from its current level of approximately 92 MMscfd to fill the existing Songas processing and pipeline transportation infrastructure of approximately 102 MMcfd for the duration of the Songo Songo block license, which expires in 2026. Parallel to the proposed PAET Songo Songo expansion, the Government of Tanzania, under its National Natural Gas Infrastructure Program (NNGIP), has commissioned the construction of the gas processing and coastal pipeline network. This includes the construction of a new gas processing plant on Songo Songo Island nearby the existing Songas facility, and an offshore pipeline to run parallel to the existing pipeline network. This offshore pipeline will be connected to the 500km pipeline (currently under construction) from Mnazi Bay to Dar es Salaam at Somango Fungo. The main EPC contractor for the NNGIP is China Petroleum Technology & Development Corporation (CPTDC), a wholly owned subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). In the future and subject to the conclusion of satisfactory commercial agreements, PAET may deliver some of the gas produced from its wells for processing to the nearby NNGIP processing plant currently under construction. The 500km pipeline and the new gas processing plant are not part of PAETs current expansion project and are therefore not considered Associated Facilities to the project.Songo Songo Island is located in the Kilwa District, Lindi Region of Tanzania. From Dar es Salaam, the island is accessible mainly by water directly from the port of Dar es Salaam or by road to various landing points on the mainland (Somango, Kilwa Masoko etc.) and then by marine vessels. The island is also accessible by air with light aircraft, for which there is a landing strip. Based on available records, Songo Songo Island has a population of approximately 5 600 inhabitants whose main livelihood is fishing. The local community also keeps some livestock, cattle, goats and chickens, and undertakes seaweed farming on a small scale.","","","","The IFCs environmental and social due diligence of this project was based upon review of (i) environmental and social documents supplied by the Company; (ii) meetings with the Company representatives, World Bank Group representatives, local authorities and central Government; and (iii) site visits with the Company to its operations. The IFC visited the Songo Songo gas processing facility as well as ancillary infrastructure on Songo Songo Island. These site visits were supported by presentations from PAET senior management teams and meetings with operational teams including those responsible for environmental, occupational health and safety (EHS) and human resources management. The visits also included review of written information submitted by the Company. The IFC also visited the NNGIP processing plant construction site on Songo Songo Island, and the pipeline construction in the Mukuranga District, approximately 60km south of Dar es Salaam.","","","","","","","","","","","","IFCs appraisal considered environmental and social management plans for the Project and gaps if any between these plans and IFC requirements. Where necessary corrective measures, intended to close these gaps within a reasonable period of time, are summarized in the paragraphs that follow and (if applicable) in the agreed Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP). Through implementation of these management plans and the ESAP the Project is expected to be designed and operated in accordance with Performance Standards objectives.The proposed project is essentially an expansion of existing gas production, and the marginal environmental and social risks and impacts of the expansion are not significant. Those impacts can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to recognized performance standards, procedures, guidelines and design criteria as described in the following sections. Thus, this is a Category B project in accordance with IFCs Environmental and Social Sustainability Policy.Pre-existing Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) management issues associated with gas exploration drilling, production and processing at the Songo Songo natural gas field include, waste management; water management; occupational, health and safety (OHS) and public safety; hazardous materials management; and greenhouse gas emissions related to gas flaring. The expansion could potentially exacerbate some of these issues, especially waste generation but all are expected to be relatively easily mitigated as part of the Companys Safety and Environmental Management System (SEMS).","","","","",34240,"",B-AB - Oil and Gas Production (Includes Development),"","","",""

The field has been developed under the Songo Songo Gas-to-Power Project, an integrated project that covers the gamut of exploration, development and production of gas, followed by processing, transportation and distribution of gas for power generation, and includes sales of gas to industrial and CNG users.  The project was originally established in 2001 as a public-private partnership with the support of the World Bank.The Songo Songo natural gas development project (the Project) is a program of well workovers, one additional new development well and associated field infrastructure investment required to expand natural gas production at the Songo Songo gas field from its current level of approximately 92 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscfd) to approximately 102 MMscfd, filling the existing Songas Limited infrastructure and maximizing gas production for the balance of the Songo Songo licence period to 2026.  This expansion of production would support additional electricity generation and supplemental gas sales associated with the Songo Songo Gas-to-Power Project.  This work program would be implemented by end-2015 or early 2016, with an estimated total project cost of approximately US$120 million.","","","","","","The Project is expected to:(i) support the development of indigenous natural gas resources to produce least-cost power generation for industrial use and in line with Tanzania''s comparative resource advantage;(ii) increase the competitiveness of industrial enterprises by providing greater access to a cheaper and more reliable source of electricity;(iii) provide a foundation for the expansion of existing gas fired power plants as well as support the future construction of greenfield facilities that will alleviate Tanzania''s forecast power shortages and underpin future economic growth;(iv) support the continued development of a commercial domestic market and infrastructure for natural gas;(v) displace more expensive and polluting fuel sources such as fuel oil and diesel, thus reducing the cost of electricity while simultaneously mitigating the potential for greater greenhouse gas emissions;(vi) reduce the dependency on indigenous charcoal and the associated de-forestation related to charcoal production; and(vii) help increase Tanzania''s energy supply stability by diversifying the energy mix of Tanzania''s power generation sector away from its reliance on weather dependent hydroelectric generation and expensive liquid fuels, towards a higher proportion of gas fired generation, which is inherently more reliable, cost effective and can respond more flexibly to changing power demand.","","The Sponsor has agreed to make Project payments to Government of Tanzania public, as well as contracts or key contract terms.Revenues generated under the Project will be subject to a Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) signed in 2001 between the Government of Tanzania, Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) and PAET, which agreement provides PAET the right to develop, produce, market and sell natural gas from Songo Songo and clearly defines the treatment of proceeds from the sale of hydrocarbons, and the key terms of which are provided in Orcas annual and quarterly financial statements.

With the goal of continuing to grow its business, Birla Carbon proposes to establish a greenfield carbon black production plant, Columbian Chemicals (Jining), 5 km to the north of Jining City, Shandong province, China. The plant will be constructed in two phases i.e., Phase I with a capacity of 120,000 ton per year expected to become operational by end of 2016, and Phase II with an incremental capacity of 120,000 tons expected to come into operation 2-3 years after completion of Phase I. The plant will adopt established technology from Columbian Chemicals (USA), which is also a subsidiary of Birla Carbon. Columbian Chemicals (Jining) will be built within an existing chemical industrial park in Jining, adjacent to an existing plant of the Jining Carbon Group which will supply most of the raw materials for Columbian Chemicals (Jining).  The production process involves the controlled oxidation of creosote oil and other heavy oils.  In this instance, the tail gas from the oxidation process which consists of carbon monoxide and hydrogen will be used for co-generation to produce steam and generate electricity.  Preliminary engineering design for the project is complete and the engineering/procurement/construction (EPC) model will be adopted for the project. The shortlisting of EPC contractors has been completed with the associated companies being major contractors in the chemical industry; the final EPC contractor will be selected in early 2015. The industrial park was initially established in early 2002 and expansion of the park is underway which includes the Birla Carbon project. The 15-ha project site is surrounded by other chemical plants and farmlands and the nearest villages are around 800-1000 meters from the proposed manufacturing processes.The project involves IFCs investment of both debt and equity in Columbian Chemicals (Jining) for Phase I.","","","","The review of this project consisted of appraising technical, environmental, health, safety, and social information submitted by the project sponsor and undertaking a field visit in December 2014. The environmental and social (E&S) appraisal team visited the proposed project site in Jining and the adjacent plant of the Jining Carbon Group which will provide the raw materials. The E&S team held meetings with Birla Carbons project management team, Jining Carbon Groups management team, and local government agencies responsible for land acquisition and industrial park management. The E&S team also held a separate meeting with the representatives of nearby villages whose lands is being acquired for expansion of the industrial park. Documents related to the production process, environmental impact assessment (EIA) inclusive of emission modeling and a cumulative impact assessment, safety impact assessments (SIA), energy conservation evaluation, and water and material balances associated  with Columbian Chemicals (Jining) were reviewed, and environmental monitoring data for ambient conditions at the Jining Carbon Group plant were also assessed.  In addition to the site visit in China, the team also visited Birla Carbons fully operational plant and ABGs HR training center in Maharashtra State, India.","","","","","","","","","","","","The proposed manufacturing facility will be located in an existing industrial park with process wastewater either treated or recycled in the process and non-process related waste water such as sanitary sewage from on-site restrooms treated at the wastewater treatment plant in the industrial park.  In respect to air quality, the modelling indicates limited potential impacts to nearby communities and there is also limited economic displacement as a result of establishment of the facility.  The key E&S risks and issues relate to the following; i) wastewater treatment and recycling; ii) air emissions and dust controls; iii) occupational health and safety during construction and operations; iv) energy efficiency; v) the management of operational hazards, vi) fire prevention, and emergency response and community engagement and livelihood restoration as a result of establishment of the industrial park. The project will be built in an established industrial area on land previously used for agriculture thus.

It has a renewable 25-year concession for exclusive rights to transport dry goods and liquids from Sokhna Port 1 located 8 km south of OPCs production facilities.   At the port, OPC has a berth with three berthing dolphins for the unloading of 3,500 tons cargo propylene gas tankers.  To expand its current propylene storage capacity, as part of this proposed project, OPC will; (a) conduct port dredging to accommodate larger capacity vessels; and (b) install additional propylene storage capacity.  Having started operations in 2001, OPC stopped production in September 2011 due to the interruption of delivery of propylene, its main feedstock, from Libya. CH anticipates OPC to soon resume operations by using imported propylene from Abu Dhabi.   EHC is completing construction of a 350,000 tons per year (tpa) greenfield mining grade low density ammonium nitrate (LDAN) plant in a 500,000 square meter area bounded by the Suez  Hurghada highway to the east, and Suez Safety Outfitters Company (SSOC) and Oriental Petrochemicals (OPC) to the south. The proposed MGAN Plant will consist of an 850 metric tons per day (mtpd) nitric acid unit, a 1,060 mtpd MGAN unit, and a prilling plant to produce solid ammonium nitrate granules.

Aldo is a privately held Canadian corporation that produces footwear and operates a worldwide chain of over 1800 shoe and related accessory stores, including franchise stores, with a strong presence in the US and Canada. IFC will provide short term financing to the suppliers of the Company in exchange for their receivables owed by Aldo to help them better manage their cash flow needs as well as to provide them with a cheaper source of financing. The short term facility proposed by IFC is expected to be initially utilized by Chinese and Vietnamese suppliers, and can be expanded to include other emerging markets.","","","","In supplier financing programs of this nature, IFCs due diligence approach is to asses environmental and social (E&S) risk at supplier level by reviewing buyers management system and procedures, especially as it relates to managing E&S performance of their Suppliers.IFC due diligence for this proposed transaction involved: (i) a review of Aldos documentation pertaining to E&S management of the supply chain, including Aldos Code of Ethics, Aldo Group Ethical Sourcing Policy and samples of compliance audits and action plans of selected suppliers; (ii) written responses to questionnaires regarding Aldos management of E&S aspects in the supply chain; (iii) conference calls with Aldos Ethics and Compliance Manager; and (iv) a review of publically available information on emerging issues on the footwear manufacturing supply chain with particular emphasis in China and Vietnam.","","","","","","","","","","","","In the shoe and accessory manufacturing sector in emerging markets, key E&S elements are mostly related to labor practices, including child labor, forced labor, occupational health and safety, over-time, and grievance mechanisms; in addition, for the shoe manufacturing sector, management of supply chain issues on sourcing of materials such as rubber and leather are of relevance. Expected suppliers under this facility are mainly assembly lines and are unlikely to process leather or other raw materials, reducing therefore the environmental risks.

Its business includes gas connection services, gas transportation and distribution, operation of gas refueling stations and LNG production. In the past few years, Tian Lun Gas has extended its area of operations from central China to northeast, northwest, southwest and southern China. Currently, Tian Lun Gas is the operator of 43 city gas concessions (~95% exposure in frontier regions), reaching over 593,000 households and 3,000 commercial/industrial customers. The Company also operates 28 CNG/LNG gas refueling stations and 7 CNG parent stations, and has three LNG plants either under construction or under development, with total annual production of 600 million m3. The proposed investment (the Project) consists of: (i) an A Loan of up to US$40 million ; (ii) an MCPP loan of up to US$20 million (iii) an equity investment up to $75 million; and (iii) a potential equity investment of up to $75 million from the IFC Asset Management Company.

Tian Lun Gas currently has over 50 wholly or majority owned subsidiaries in China. Tian Lun gets its natural gas from high-pressure national gas pipelines and transfers it to its city gate stations through branch pipelines. The gate stations are for temporary storage of natural gas and pressure reduction before transfer to city pipeline networks. The gas from filling stations is either from local pipeline or CNG tankers.","","","","The review of this Project consisted of appraising technical, environmental, health, safety, and social information submitted by the project sponsor, and undertaking field visits in September and October 2014. The environmental and social (E&S) appraisal team held meetings with Tian Lun Gas managers for operation safety, environment, human resources, and engineering/construction at its headquarters in Zhengzhou, China. The team visited the proposed  liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant sites in Henan Province and Chongqing City, selected city gas gate stations, compressed natural gas (CNG)/LNG filling stations, and the branch pipeline route to connect the upstream  gas supply and city gas gate stations in Henan Province, China. The team had in-depth discussions in Kai County, with government and township authorities, and with a group of directly affected villagers. The team also interviewed Tian Lun project directors with responsibility for key greenfield project developments. Documents related to environmental impact assessments (EIAs), safety impact assessments, E&S management programs/procedures, resource consumption analysis, environmental and safety permits, environmental monitoring data, historic and current land acquisition summary, regulatory land acquisition governing documents, official compensation and mitigation measure documents etc. were reviewed and discussed during the appraisal.IFCs appraisal considered E&S management plans for the Project and gaps if any between these plans and IFC requirements. Where necessary, corrective measures, intended to close these gaps within a reasonable period of time, are summarized in the paragraphs that follow and in the agreed Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) disclosed in this review summary.

(YSH, the Sponsor) and its local partner as the first greenfield provider of vehicle operating leases of scale in Myanmar. The Company aims to take the first mover advantage to serve the strong demand for operating leases including corporates in the agriculture, fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) and construction sectors. The purpose of the Project is to finance the Companys capex plan to purchase a fleet of various types of vehicles.","","","","","","Improved MSMEs reach through alternative financing: The Project will lower barriers of entry for MSMEs to get fleet and equipment through this additional channel for capex financing, in addition to bank borrowings. For instance, about one-third of the Company''s top customers are MSMEs who mainly work in agribusiness, and construction. They are typically facing a severe lack of access to credit due to the non-existence of operating lease providers and strict credit requirements in the banking market in Myanmar. The Project will enable more MSMEs to modernize their equipment and consequently improve their service level and expand their economic activities.Improved Productivity and Distribution Efficiency: The Project will help to increase the efficiency of the domestic agribusiness, FMCG and construction supply chains through improved mechanization. For example, in Myanmar''s agriculture sector, as of 2010, the number of tractors per thousand population was only 0.2 vs. 2.1 for Vietnam and 3.5 for Thailand. In the FMCG and construction sectors, in some cases the level of equipment utilization is half the international best practice due to the lack of preventive maintenance. The Project will help to address some of the productivity issues by improving utilization and help to enhance distribution efficiency by enabling faster and cleaner transportation.Direct and Indirect Employment: The Project will help to create a number of direct jobs for staff and significant indirect jobs along the supply chain such as repair and maintenance workers and drivers. We estimated 1,815 additional indirect jobs will be created.Demonstration Effect: the Company is the first mover in Myanmar to adopt international best practices in terms of insurance and drivers trainings, which will help to raise industry standards and workers'' transferrable skills. The Company requires dealers to employ and train people to a high standard in maintenance skills which are currently not prevalent in the market.Tax payments: The Project is expected to contribute to the domestic economy through the payment of various taxes such as import duties and corporate income taxes.","","","Long Term Financing: IFC will provide early stage, long term capital which is not readily available in Myanmar due to the current development of the financial system.<br><br>Corporate Governance: IFC is in the position to assist Yoma Agricultural & Logistics Holdings and the Company to establish corporate governance and risk management structures that adhere to international best practices.<br><br>Stamp of Approval: IFC''s brand will help YSH and Yoma Agricultural & Logistics Holdings to raise subsequent funding from the market to support their continued expansion.","","","The Company is held by Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd (YSH) through its 100% subsidiary Myanmar Motors Pte.

UNIT Equity,Investment,Environmental Documents,Active,Europe and Central Asia,Türkiye,Unit Investment N.V.,Regional Industry INF MCT,2015-02-19T05:00:00Z,"",A,Other,"IFC's proposed investment is an equity participation of up to US$137.5 million in UNIT Investment NV ('UNIT' or the 'company'), an owner and developer of power generation assets primarily in Turkey and other countries in Europe and the Middle East.  IFC's investment in the company will provide financing for UNIT's potential power generation projects (the 'project'). UNIT is a member of the UNIT Group which is a conglomerate with a focus on energy generation, EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) contracting, and electricity trade. UNIT Group is also active in the tourism, steel product trade, and mining sectors.  UNIT has a long history as an independent power producer ('IPP') developer and owner having developed Turkey's first IPP project, the 480 MW Uni-Mar IPP in the mid-1990s.  Since then, UNIT has developed, built and operated a substantial power generation fleet with total installed capacity of about 2,000MW composed of both conventional and renewable technologies, including Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT), hydroelectric and wind.  IFC's funds will be utilized by UNIT for potential power generation investments in the Middle East, Southeastern Europe, and Turkey, including the Unit Zakho project (a new 1,260 MW CCGT plant planned to be developed in Iraq).  IFC appraised this Unit Zakho project (#34482) as a separate project in early 2014 and this project is pending approval by IFC as of February2015.  UNIT's portfolio of power generation plants is summarized below:Boyabat Hydroelectric Power Plant - HEPP (Boyabat Elektrik Uretim A.S.), 513 MW, Turkey (SINOP Boyabat). This HEPP started commercial operation in Dec 2012 and is 33 % owned by UNIT.  The operation and maintenance of the plant is being conducted by Boyabat Elektrik Uretim A.S.  This is the largest private hydropower plant project in Turkey developed so far and is located on Kizilirmak River, the longest river in Turkey.  The plant has a 195 m height concrete gravity dam (height from the foundation), a 65.4 km2 reservoir (60 km reservoir length, 3,557 million m3 capacity), and required about 70 km2 land acquisition (of which about 31 km2 was private land).  Government managed land acquisition and resettlement associated with the development of this project is covered under PS 5 section below. UNIT informed IFC that there was a court case (which is now settled) involving Cultural Heritage Protection Regional Committee in Ankara about a cemetery (kaya mezarlik) that was inundated by the reservoir. Bagistas II Hydroelectric Power Plant (Akdenizli Elektrik Uretim A.S.), 49.8 MW, Turkey (Erzincan). This HEPP started commercial operation in December 2012 and is 100 % owned by UNIT.  The plant has a 19.5 m height concrete gravity dam (height from foundation).  The plant is a run-of-river hydropower scheme and is located on the Euphrates River.  The Euphrates River is an international river that originates in Turkey and flows through Syria and Iraq.  Bagistas II HEPP is a relatively small operational HEPP located far upstream of two very large reservoir type HEPPs (Keban HEPP and Ataturk HEPP), and as such is considered to have negligible adverse impacts on the downstream riparian countries (Syria).  Government managed land acquisition was done and there remain some open court cases with respect to the compensation amounts. No physical relocation of people was required. The plant design included a fish pass to mitigate potential impacts on fish movement in the river.  The plant is being operated by Bogaz Elektrik Uretim A.S. which is a subsidiary of UNIT.  Yeni/Gebze natural gas-fired combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plant (Yeni Elektrik Uretim A.S.), 865 MW, Turkey (Kocaeli Dilovasi) located in an industrial zone about 60 km from Istanbul. The plant started operation in December 2013, and is 60% owned by UNIT. The plant's cooling system is Air Cooled Condenser to minimize water usage.  The plant is equipped with low NOx burners.  The plant is being operated by UNES established with the equal participation of UNIT and ESB International (ESBI).  The electricity is transmitted by 400 kV transmission lines to two substations of TEIAS (5 km and 20 km from Yeni Elektrik).  TEIAS acquired right-of-way for these transmission lines through expropriation, and UNIT is aware that there are some ongoing litigations and is monitoring the progress.  Uni-Mar natural gas-fired CCGT plant (Uni-Mar Enerji Yatirmlari A.S.), 480 MW, Turkey (Marmara Ereglisi) located about 100 km west of Istanbul. It has a dual fuel capability to use natural gas and fuel oil, and the plant has a distillate fuel oil storage capacity which allows 10 day operation on fuel oil.  The plant started commercial operation in June 1999, and is 32% owned by UNIT. The plant was the first Build Operate and Transfer (BOT) scheme power plant project by the Government of Turkey. The plant is being operated by National Power Enerji AS (Turkey)  100% subsidiary of International Power Plc. The plant uses a seawater once-through cooling system.  The plant may be expanded after the BOT period ends in 2019.  According to UNIT, no any pending E&S issues exist about this plant.  Prolez Wind Power Plant (WPP, VGE -1 OOD), 9 MW, Bulgaria. The plant started commercial operation in Nov 2010, and is 100% owned by UNIT.  The plant has three Vestas V90-3MW wind turbine generators with 120 m hub height.  The plant is located in an agricultural area.  Zakho natural gas-fired CCGT project 840 MW (initially as simple cycle power plant, and at later stage, to be completed as 1,260 MW CCGT plant), Iraq (Zakho, Northern Iraq). The project is under development and is targeted to start commercial operation in July 2017. The plant will use a dry-low NOx gas turbines and Air Cooled Condensers to minimize water consumption.  The project is 56% owned by UNIT.  Univiridas/Babina Greda biomass-fired circulating fluidized bed (CFB) power plant (Univiridas D.O.O.), 10 MW, under commissioning, Croatia. The plant is targeted to start commercial operation in 2015, and is 70% owned by UNIT.  The plant will use wood based biomass (e.g. wood chips).  The wood based biomass will be delivered by trucks from the vicinity of the plant within 50 km radius.  For future investment, UNIT is conducting preliminary studies of multiple projects including gas-fired CCGT projects, biomass / gas  fired cogeneration plants (district heating) projects, and conventional coal-fired combined heat and power plants.","","","","IFC's appraisal of this investment consisted of (i) site visits by IFC's environmental and social (E&S) specialists to the company's selected invested projects (Boyabat HEPP, Yeni/Gebze natural gas-fired CCGT and Uni-Mar natural gas-fired CCGT) on November 18-20 2014 to understand E&S performance of existing assets invested by UNIT, (ii) discussion with the company's senior management about the company's E&S management practice and strategy for new and existing power generation projects on November 17, 2014, and (iii) the company's E&S documents provided in response to IFC's appraisal questionnaire about the current E&S management practice of the company against IFC Performance Standards. IFC also used the E&S documents obtained during IFC's appraisal of Unit Zakho project (#34482) and of which the E&S review summary was disclosed on March 24, 2014.IFC's appraisal considered UNIT's E&S management plans for their potential new power generation projects and gaps if any between these plans and IFC requirements. IFC's appraisal also considered E&S performance of a representative set of UNIT's existing power generation plants in their portfolio and identified key E&S risks of which UNIT is managing carefully.  Where necessary, corrective measures, intended to close these gaps (for new power generation projects) and mitigate identified risks (for existing portfolio power plants) within a reasonable period of time, are summarized in the paragraphs that follow and in the Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) disclosed in this review summary. Through implementation of these management plans and the ESAP, UNIT's new power generation projects are expected to be designed and operated in accordance with IFC Performance Standards objectives, and also, E&S risks of UNIT's existing power plants will be mitigated towards IFC Performance Standards.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",36326,"",V-IA - Electric Power Other (Including Holding Companies),"","","",""

The main E&S risks and impacts of this project relate to the ability of CRDB to identify and manage the E&S risks associated with the activities of its clients in line with IFC's policy requirements. The client's existing E&S risk assessment process covers EIA requirements, compliance with applicable E&S laws, and also covers a potential issue list' which identifies areas that may pose increased environmental risks. The existing process does not cover the Performance Standards and there are also no tools in place for implementation. The client will be required to revise the risk assessment procedures to meet IFC's requirements and also appoint an E&S Officer.

BTST was established in early 2015 to provide mobile network and fixed wireless operators in Latin America with an economically viable and environmentally friendly outsourced alternative to in-house construction, maintenance and ownership of telecommunication tower sites. As such, the project represents a unique opportunity for IFC to partner with an independent wireless tower company to make front the lack of adequate infrastructure in the region and the increasing demand for data, and to foster a competitive environment in countries with recent release of their telecom spectrum.","","","","","","(i)	Upside wireless penetration levels in the region: With the construction of additional tower sites, existing mobile operators will be able to expand the reach of their services both in terms of geography and capacity. In addition, collocation reduces the incremental cost of expanding service for all carriers thereby allowing them to service remote and economically less developed areas where ARPU and usage will be lower.(ii) Foster competition: The expansion project of BTST will allow smaller and newer wireless operators to benefit from reduced barriers to entry as they will have access to leased tower facilities and/or to build their own towers with an expertise partner such as BTST.(iii) Expand access to other ICT technologies: BTST''s tower network is capable of supporting not only mobile cellular networks, but also wireless broadband and backhaul networks, thereby improving the penetration of these technologies.(iv) Mitigate environmental impact and Climate Change: The project on hand will provide a cost effective opportunity to telecommunication operators to reduce their carbon emission footprint by sharing infrastructure. A significant benefit of sharing tower infrastructure arises from the material, energy and emissions savings that ensue from building only one tower instead of three or four.(v) Job Creation: the project will assists in the creation of both direct and indirect employment opportunities.","","","IFC''s valued added will be reflected in the following:<br>(a)	Knowledge sharing: BTST may leverage IFC''s knowledge experience and relationships with main players in the sector to develop new strategies and consolidate its operations. <br>(b)	Regional presence: IFC''s participation could eventually help the Sponsor broaden the scope of its footprint, potentially expanding into new markets. <br>(c)	Establish and maintain Environmental & Social standards as well as Corporate Governance: IFC will ensure that BTST develops and implements the proper policies and procedures as it continue to grow in the region.","","","Cartesian Capital Group is a global PE firm managing more than $2bn.

The aggregate settlement credit available to financial institutions in a country largely determines the total amount of non-cash transactions possible on payment networks and by increasing the settlement credit, the facility will enable greater access to finance in the country. Safer transactions and integration with international markets: greater use of electronic payments will make transactions safer, more efficient and inclusive and will enable greater integration in international markets which in turn fuel growth and drive business growth for merchants.  Support enabling environment: the wide range of payment solutions offered by MasterCard would support the development and implementation of credit, debit, prepaid and related payment programs and solutions for consumers and merchants. Skill transfer: MasterCard establishes and enforces a common set of standards for adherence by its customers for the use of its payments network.  Supporting MasterCard''s further expansion into emerging markets will thus result in a transfer of skill and innovation from a sophisticated technology company and payments industry leader to local financial institutions institutions to drive greater acceptance of digital payments, especially at the bottom of the pyramid and lessens the usage of cash.","","",IFC is uniquely positioned to partner with MasterCard on the Facility.

It also defines eligible and ineligible activities that could be financed with the use of the MasterCard platform. Labor and working conditions of MasterCard are in line with requirements of the Performance Standard 2 on Labor and Working Conditions.

Suppliers' conformity with Puma's global compliance principles is expected. IFC's review focused on Puma's management systems and procurement procedures in relation to E&S practices, with special emphasis on their application among its Suppliers in Bangladesh.IFC's due diligence involved the review of Puma's global compliance system through publicly available information, telephonic and email communication with Puma management team, review of internal procedures provided by Puma, and review of sample of audit reports for selected suppliers. Audit reports and action plans reviewed cover both Puma's compliance system and the specific assessments for structural, electrical and fire safety elements.

The most significant of these impacts are related to labor practices, including child labor, forced labor, occupational health and safety, wages, overtime, grievance mechanism, and overall safe and fair employment conditions; life and fire safety protection (including emergency response); emissions to air and water, hazardous materials management and use of energy and water. In addition, for the shoe manufacturing sector, management of supply chain issues on sourcing of materials such as rubber and leather are of relevance.PUMA's supplier system considers potential impacts of the suppliers in the aspects related to PS1 (Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts) and PS2 (Labor and working conditions); elements of PS3 (Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention) are considered in the audit process. The suppliers to be financed within this Project are all existing factories.

This is fundamental not only from an environmental and social perspective but also from a competitive angle as the RMG sector accounts for significant employment, export earnings and manufacturing in the country. The SEF safety necessary upgrades are identified in the corrective action plans (CAPs) carried out by (i) the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety (Alliance) (ii) the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety (Accord) and similar credible institutions such as National Tripartite Plan of Action on Fire Safety and Structural Integrity in the garment Sector of Bangladesh (NTPA).","","","","","","Support for the backbone of Bangladesh Industry and economy: RMG sector represents 78% of exports (2nd largest exporter after China) and 15% of GDP (15 to 20% annual growth rate). Any disruptions to the RMG sector would stall progress on alleviating poverty. The proposed safety upgrades are a vital element in helping Bangladesh to maintain its global market position in the RMG sector.Improve all workers (including women) working conditions: about 90% of RMG sectors workers are women from poor backgrounds and families at the base of the pyramid with limited or no financial safety net. Improved SEF standards will help save lives and protect the livelihood of families relying on the income from RMG sector employees.Enhancing E&S capacity: Utilizing IFC''s in-house E&S expertise to help create capacity in Partner Banks to monitor E&S standards and compliance, which would contribute to improving the overall working environment of Bangladesh RMG sector.Establishing a prototype to engage other donors and development agencies to support worker safety in Bangladesh.Job Creation: RMG sector has been the largest employer in Bangladesh, employing 3.7 million workers.

The project calls for the construction of a new permeate tower to allow AFISA to increase permeate drying capacity and at the same time, switching the existing permeate drying tower to processing whey protein concentrates (WPC). AFISA, founded in 2000 as a JV between Arla Foods Ingredients (Denmark) and SanCor (Argentina), is a premier and leading processor of whey, a by-product of cheese production. AFISA is primarily operated by AFI, with SanCor functioning principally as a supplier of raw materials. AFISA controls the management, the commercial, processing and strategic direction, while SanCor provides the JV with the whey. Environmental and social sustainability standards are promoted by this project as whey is typically disposed of through land application or used as animal feed. By increasing the economic valued of whey, a milk derivative previously considered to be waste, processors such as AFISA help reduce the waste stream. The Company possesses first-rate technological capabilities, as well as a solid track record and full commitment to E&S standards. AFISA's processing facility is located in Porteña (Córdoba, Argentina). In this plant, the whey is filtered, dried and converted into whey protein concentrates functional milk proteins (FMP) and permeate powders. These products are used for functional nutrition, to replace lactose and milk powder in foods including infant formulas and it is also used as animal feed.","","","","The scope of the review of AFISA included assessment of the management capacity to provide adequate oversight of environmental, social, health and safety risks and impacts in relation to IFC Performance Standards, regulatory requirements and relevant aspects of applicable Environmental Health and Safety guidelines. The environmental and social due diligence consisted of the following: (i) a visit to AFISA's main office in Buenos Aires to meet and discuss the project with AFISA's management team; and (ii) a visit to the plant in Porteña, Córdoba. This  visit included interviews with key management and operational staff, and a tour of the facilities including the  whey reception control rooms, warehouse storage rooms, operating rooms, processing rooms, main administrative office, and waste water treatment plant.  During the plant visit the following staff was interviewed: whey procurement manager, environmental manager, quality assurance manager, occupational, health and safety manager, laboratory operators, coordinator for human resources capacity building, warehouse and packing room personnel. Lastly, the whey supplying plants (at SanCor, plus two other companies) were visited. This visit included interviews with the plant managers to discuss AFISA's processing requirements and working relationship, environmental and quality requirements, visit to the whey processing facility and general discussions about their requirements to primary producers.  In addition to the meetings and plant inspections, the due diligence also consisted of document and report reviews made available by AFISA. These included audits for waste water plants, raw water wells, air emissions, occupational, health and safety training reports, occupational, health and safety statistics, permits and certifications, supply chain code of conduct, and certificates of waste processors involved in landfarming.IFC's appraisal considered environmental and social management plans for the Project and gaps if any between these plans and IFC requirements.  Where necessary, corrective measures, intended to close these gaps within a reasonable period of time, are summarized in the paragraphs that follow and in the agreed Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) disclosed in this review summary.

Of total land holdings, roughly 6,500 ha are planted with teak (Tectona grandis). A project was proposed earlier that was to include expansion of the land base of the project to roughly 30,000 ha, of which about 18,000 ha would have been planted in teak and the balance managed for conservation or infrastructure purpose. However, the Company decided in 2013 not to expand its operations and will plant no additional forests prior to harvest of existing teak stands. IFC is considering a debt investment in the Company which will be spending about US$ 40 million on managing its plantations through maturity, equipment purchases, installation of a primary saw mill, and working capital.  The Company's operations are centered in Mato Grosso state with a small, limited trial at the western edge of Goias state.  The regions where the existing farms are located in that part of the Amazônia Legal originally covered by cerrado or savannah habitat. All areas which have been planted with teak by CVA were converted from the cerrado vegetation to agricultural use (cattle, soy, corn, etc.) during the 1970s and 1980s prior to acquisition by the Company starting in 2005.","","","","The review of this project consisted of a review of technical, environmental and social information submitted by Companhia do Vale do Araguaia (CVA or the Company).  Extensive interviews were held with company management and staff at all levels.  Meetings were also held with municipal and provincial government authorities and private sector entities associated with project operations, including administrators and security personnel from a Mato Grosso state penitentiary that is providing voluntary, paid prison labor to the Company's main plantation estate, Fazenda São Jorge, near the town of Água Boa.

CVA planted nearly 6,500 hectares (ha) of teak on about 9,672 ha near the town of Agua Boa, is the eastern part of Mato Groso state (the Project).  CVA is managing the teak on a 22-year cycle whereby final harvests begin in about 2026, but there are periodic thinnings of the plantation stands, which generate wood sales in the interim.  The Company will install and operate a wood processing facility to produce and sell teak products to regional and international markets.  The balance between the total land of the Project and the area planted with teak is over 3000 ha, most of which CVA looks after in one of two forms: either as a Reserva Legal (general land set-aside), or as an Área de Preservação Permanente (land reserves required for watershed or other ecological protection).","","","","","The Company proposes avoiding and mitigating environmental and social impacts by establishing clear operational procedures and management systems for the forestry operations, training plan for staff (and if applicable, consultants) and screening and compliance with environmental requirements as well as compliance with World Bank Group Environmental Health and Safety requirements.","Climate change mitigation: Tree growth and addition of significant soil carbon will sequester nearly 100,000t CO2e p.a. Plantations have a positive impact on surface water balance and improve the region''s drying microclimate. The sale of ""non-commercial"" thinnings and waste wood processing from processing to local agro-processing facilities substitutes for biomass partly derived from the clearing of native forest and vegetation.ii.	Local economic diversification:The Company is in a region where local economic well-being is very dependent on cattle grazing and the cultivation of soy and corn.  The Project contributes to reducing the local economy''s over dependence on too narrow a range of commodities and broadens the skill base of the labor market.iii.	Employment generation: Cattle grazing, soy and corn cultivation generate fewer jobs per hectare than plantation forestry.  Moreover, the Company operates within the formal sector with respect to its employment practices.  As such, the Project makes a contribution to generation of year-round jobs and does so in the formal sector.iv.	Re-socialization of prisoners: Through FundaÃ§Ã£o ""Nova Chance"" (translated as Fresh Start), a convict rehabilitative program sponsored by the Mato Grosso government, CVA has been employing inmates since the latter part of 2013.  The goal of Nova Chance is to break the cycle by which former convicts have a very high rate at which they return to crime after prison and, ultimately, are imprisoned again.  Most of the prisoners are from economically disadvantaged backgrounds such that - for example - they may not have formal sector work experience or bank accounts.   The program helps prepare them for life after incarceration by establishing and funding a bank account in their name with a cushion of savings following their release and provides recent work experience.","","","i.	Long-term finance: <br>Due to the long-dated nature of the Project and that it is executed by a medium-sized enterprise, it is not easy for commercial lenders to provide a loan that is suited to the Project, allowing IFC to play a critical role in bridging to CVA''s bankability. IFC will provide tailor-made, flexible, long-term financing which is not readily available in the market.<br><br>ii.	Indication of investment appropriateness for future investors: <br>IFC will be the first lender to CVA after the Brazilian development bank. While the Company is operating to good standards with respect to areas future investors will look at (e.g. corporate governance, environmental and social sustainability), IFC''s presence as a partner and lender can be expected over the long-term to ease access the Company''s access to debt or equity funding. <br><br>iii.

In addition, it produces limited quantities of tinted and coated glass.  The company plans to introduce a second production line of 200,000 tons per year capacity which would enable it to dedicate one of its production units exclusively to the production of clear float glass. This will allow maximum efficiency in one production line, due to minimal changeovers, while allowing the other line to produce a more optimal mix of higher value added glass for the automotive, household appliances and construction (coated glass) sectors. The production process consists of charging the raw materials required to make clear or colored glass through weighing, mixing and conveying to the furnace which produces molten glass. The molten glass then passes into a bath of molten tin where the temperature is gradually reduced and the glass sheets can be pulled off the bath by rollers. Variation in the flow speed and roller speed enables glass sheets of varying thickness to be formed.

The proposed investment consists of a risk-sharing facility of up to US$ 3 million with Société Ivoirienne de Banque (SIB), a subsidiary of the Attijariwafa Bank Group in Côte d'Ivoire, on a portfolio of eligible leases for trucks for selected Cargill partner cocoa cooperatives. SIB's overall portfolio entails exposures in the following sectors: Trade, Agribusiness, Transportation, and Divers Services; however, current exposures do not entail cooperatives in the cocoa sector. The main direct environmental risk of this project is related to the truck maintenance practices by the cooperatives. However, the most significant environmental and social risks of this project are related to the production of cocoa in Côte d'Ivoire, which is known to have been linked to the use of child labor and has involved the conversion of natural/critical habitats. These are considered to have potentially significant adverse social and environmental impacts that are diverse, irreversible or unprecedented. The portfolio risk is therefore considered to be high.","","The main direct environmental risk of this project is related to the truck maintenance practices by the cooperatives, specifically the management and disposal of hazardous materials such as used oil, used oil filters, and car batteries, which is currently undertaken well below basic industry standards. However, this risk can readily be addressed and mitigated through additional capacity building work to be undertaken by Cargill with participating cooperatives. The most significant, although indirect, environmental and social risks of this project are related to the production of cocoa in Côte d'Ivoire, which is known to have been linked to the use of child labor and has involved the conversion of natural/critical habitats. These risks can be mitigated through the Cargill Cocoa Promise, which is Cargill's sustainability strategy including among others, certification programs like Rainforest Alliance, UTZ and Fairtrade, which are implemented through Cargill Partner cooperatives from which Cargill procures certified cocoa, and includes a traceability mechanism for both certified and non-certified cocoa and a register of coop members reflecting their certification status/progress toward obtaining certification. Additional Cargill efforts include collaborations on education with NGOs like CARE as well as private public partnerships with state agencies in order to enhance cocoa farming and thus farmers livelihood.'Finally, as SIB is the financial institution that will be processing the leasing transactions for trucks for cooperatives, there are potential risks related to SIB's capacity to adequately assess each cooperative's performance with respect to the certification requirements as well as their truck maintenance practices. SIB has already developed the necessary Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) outlining the procedures, responsibilities and tools for undertaking E&S risk management of its lending and leasing activities. As part of this investment, SIB will be required to revise and adapt the existing ESMS including the preparation of additional E&S due diligence questionnaires specific to the cocoa cooperatives and their truck maintenance practices. SIB will be required to incorporate the E&S due diligence and monitoring of eligible cooperatives as part of the lease review cycle. To ensure adequate ESMS implementation, IFC will review the E&S due diligence undertaken by SIB for the first 5 cooperatives proposed to be included under the project.","","

Transambiental,Investment,Environmental Documents,Active,Latin America and the Caribbean,Colombia,TRANSAMBIENTAL SAS,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2015-04-17T04:00:00Z,"",B,Other,"Transcaribe S.A. is a public entity created in 2001 by the Municipality of Cartagena to structure and lead the design, planning, construction and management of the Integrated Mass Transport System (SITM) in the City of Cartagena. This involves building all infrastructure needed to operationalize the Integrated Mass Transport System (SITM). The project takes inspiration from similar initiatives that have been successfully introduced across the country like the TransMilenio system in Bogota, the MIO system in Cali and Metroplus in Medellin. Prior to the system becoming operational, Transcaribes role and responsibility involves carrying out all studies and obtaining the necessary licenses and permits for the project, clearing all public areas and roads, including the resettlement of affected persons, and building the necessary infrastructure, such as dedicated trunk lanes, main bus terminal and transfer stations, etc,, required to enable the SITM to operate. Phase I activities began in 2002 and were subject to World Bank (WB) financing in 2009 under Loan BIRF 7739-CO. To date, 97.8% of the infrastructure has been built and 98% of the resettlement process has been completed. The main bus terminal, including the administration and maintenance areas are presently being built. The bus transfer stations along the trunk line will need to undergo minor repair given that they were built more than 5 years ago, but were left unused due to lack of funding which delayed completion of the project.   In early 2014, Transcaribe launched a competitive bid process to grant the transportation concession (otherwise known as Operations & Maintenance or Phase II) to three operators covering 100% of the citys existing public transport demand. The contracts assign the day to day management of operations to the Concessionaires. This includes the hiring of drivers and other operational personnel (50% of which must be operators of the existing system), the acquisition of new buses, scrapping of old buses, operating and maintaining the fleet and managing the bus workshop.On August 6th, 2014 Concession No. 1 was awarded to Sotramac S.A.S, a special purpose vehicle (SPV) whose main shareholder is Si 99 S.A., subsidiary of Grupo Si. On October 14, 2014 Concession No. 3 was awarded to Transambiental S.A. (Transambiental or the Client herein). Transambiental is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) created for this contract. Its main shareholders are T-Caribe Holdings (63%) and Organización SUMA S.A.S.37%, a subsidiary of Grupo Si, the operational sponsor of Concession No. 1.  Grupo Si, through Si 99 S.A. and subsequently Si 03 S.A., specializes in developing integrated mass transit systems in Colombia and around the world. The Group currently has 5 active bus fleet operations linked either to bus rapid transit (BRT) or SITM (Bogota, Cali and Lima); and is the lead in structuring public transport systems in 3 cities in Central America (Tijuana, Guadalajara and San Salvador). Concessions No. 1 and No. 3 will therefore benefit from the expertise and know-how of Grupo Si.Concession No. 2 did not attract any bidders so the government awarded the contract to Transcaribe as operator. All three concessions are similar in size in terms of the number of buses and routes they must manage. Once operational, the system will comprise 2 trunk line routes, 8 pre-trunk routes, 14 feeder routes, 16 auxiliary routes and 16 suburban routes, including 658 new buses, replacing a total of 1,500 buses currently in operation. All buses will run on compressed natural gas (CNG), will be air conditioned, stop at dedicated bus stations, run on strict timetables, will be handicap accessible and equipped with smart card fare collection systems, will be equipped with emergency response and preparedness systems, and have emergency vehicle preemption (EVP) to boost safety and response times. The SITM is expected to start operations by the last quarter of 2015, and will be fully operational after a gradual implementation period of 36 months. Each concession will last for 19 years and 5 months or until the Concessionaires have obtained the expected revenue proposed in the bid, whichever occurs first. 	Concession contract No. SA-MC-007-2014, requires Transambiental to operate the mass transit system Cartagena de Indias from a main bus terminal (15 ha) located in an urbanized area in the north of the city, starting in November, 2015. Other obligations include: (i) providing the system with a predetermined number and type of vehicles (buses of 90 and 50 passengers) in different stages of the concession contract; (ii) operating the required fleet under specific standards, using CNG, and; (iii) buying and scrapping a predetermined number of buses as required in the contract. The total project cost for Concession No. 3 is estimated to be US$109.6 million. The proposed IFC-led financing package for US$72 million includes a US$24 million A Loan for IFCs own account. The remainder of the project will be financed with parallel lenders and local/international commercial banks.The SITM is expected to have a transformative impact on the city of Cartagena, in addition to contributing to a significant reduction of carbon-related emissions. The benefits arise from: (i) the optimization and rationalization of transit routes and services, (ii) the provision of competitively priced, safe, fast and reliable transportation across the city; (iii) a higher vehicle occupation in transit and cars (or a modal shift from cars to public transit), (iv) the reduction of vehicular congestion, and (v) the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions with the introduction of a fleet of buses powered by CNG.","","","","IFCs review of the project involved an appraisal visit to Colombia on 11 - 13 February 2015 that included (i) meetings with the client (Transambiental or the Concessionnaire) in Bogota, (ii) meetings in Cartagena with Transcaribe S.A., the projects operational manager and sponsor (iii) site visits to the main trunk lines (11.8 km), feeder roads, bus transfer stations, future bus terminal, depot, administrative and maintenance areas, (iv) a wrap up and final review of environmental and social matters associated with the project, including a discussion on the applicable performance standard (PS) requirements, key findings, recommendations and next steps. IFCs project appraisal considered environmental and social management issues and plans for the project, and gaps between these plans and IFC requirements. Corrective measures intended to close these gaps within a reasonable period of time are summarized below and in the agreed Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) disclosed in this review summary. Through the implementation of these management plans the Project is expected to be designed and operated in accordance with Performance Standards objectives","","","","","","","","","","","","The project is categorized as B in accordance to IFCs Environmental and Social Sustainability Policy because of the limited number of environmental and social (E&S) impacts and risks the operations and maintenance (O&M) of the SITM is expected to generate, all of which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to standard international best practices, such as those described in the World Bank Group Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines (EHS Guidelines) and the applicable performance standards (PS) identified above. The most critical environmental, social, health and safety (ESHS) considerations include: - developing a highly trained, motivated and disciplined workforce; - implementing regular maintenance and upkeep of the main bus terminal, bus fleet and associated infrastructure, including good environmental management of solid and hazardous wastes, water effluents, air emissions and noise levels, as required by host country laws and in alignment with the EHS Guidelines.","","","","",36340,"",E-AD - Transit and Ground Passenger Transporation,"","","",""

Tinka,Investment,Environmental Documents,Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Peru,Tinka Resources Limited,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2015-04-17T04:00:00Z,"",B,Other,"This project consists of an equity investment in Tinka Resources, Ltd. (Tinka or the Company), a TSX Venture (TSX-V) listed junior mining company which owns a silver (Colquipucro) and zinc (Ayawilca) resource in the departments of Cerro de Pasco in the central Andes of Peru.  IFC is considering an equity investment of up to US$10 million in Tinka to be used to carry out additional drilling activities in order to complete the Preliminary Economic Assessments (PEAs) for both projects.  Colquipucro and Ayawilca are adjacent deposits (with drilling about 1,400 meters apart) located within the same concession package.  Both projects are located at elevations ranging from 3,500 to 4,600 meters above sea level (masl) and approximately 60 km from the city of Cerro de Pasco in the central Andes of Peru.  The closest mining project to Tinka is Uchucchacua, located about 35 km from the Project site.  Colquipucro is a silver oxide deposit where the company has already drilled 6,500 meters and certified an inferred resource of 12.1 million tons of ore at an average grade of 82.3 gram per ton Ag.  Ayawilca is a zinc sulphides deposit which is at pre-resource stage where 12,400 meters have been drilled to date.  Colquipucro was mined periodically since colonial Spanish times and then explored and/or mined by several companies including Compania Minera Colquipucro, the Cerro de Pasco Corporation and Minas de Buenaventura S.A.In addition, Tinka owns a portfolio of early stage exploration projects which are currently under care and maintenance with little activity happening on the ground.In September 2014, Tinka resumed drilling activities at both sites and is planning on completing the PEAs for both projects within the next 24 months.The current workforce for Tinka includes approximately 80 people (including 30 permanent workers and 50 positions occupied by local workforce).  In addition, there are approximately 20 workers hired by the contractor (S&C) undertaking the drilling activities.  In addition, Tinka has 4 staff working in the Lima office.  The Companys exploration camp has been established adjacent to the exploration areas and include office facilities, a mess area, maintenance shop and a parking area.  Accommodation at the camp is also available for 30 people. Tinka has expressed its objective to follow good international industry practice (GIIP) in environmental, safety, health and community issues.  In this sense, IFC will assist Tinka in preparing a comprehensive Health, Safety, Environment & Community (HSEC) Policy which will contain elements of a continuous improvement process and management plans and procedures to address risks and impacts for the exploration stage with commitments for any future mine development.","","","","The review of this project consisted of an appraisal mission in November 2014 to the Colquipucro and Ayawilca exploration areas and camp to assess current Environmental, Social and Health and Safety (ESHS) management, a document review, including the projects technical, environmental, social and health and safety reports and records; interviews with key personnel of the Company and meetings with community members and land owners","","","","","","","","","","","","This is a category B project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure because the Environmental, Social and Health & Safety (ESHS) impacts related to the investment in exploration are limited, site specific and therefore adequately managed through implementation of appropriate mitigation measures.  IFCs review did not identify any significant adverse impacts or high risk exposures.IFCs categorization of this project is based on the impacts of exploration activities, which consist primarily of construction of drill pads and access roads for exploration drilling, limited emissions of dust and waste streams from camp activities and machinery maintenance, use of limited amounts of water for exploration activities.  The key social and environmental risks associated with the exploration drilling currently ongoing at Colquipucro and Ayawilca are related to (i) environmental, social and health and safety management of exploration activities  specifically erosion control, restoration and rehabilitation of drill pads and access roads, safe management and disposal of waste and oils, dust and noise control, water and effluent management, management of flora and fauna resources, occupational health and safety, community safety and emergency preparedness and response, (ii) temporary use of small fractions of land for drill pads, that have limited impacts on livestock grazing and reduced ground for agricultural use, (iii) adequate stakeholder engagement and consultation with potentially affected communities to raise awareness about mining activities and manage perceptions; (iv) managing community expectations with respect to job opportunities and community investment and, (v) ongoing community consultations and land use compensation planning.   Cerro de Pasco is a relatively mining-friendly district with several mines operating in the region for decades.  Cerro de Pasco also registers currently as having the lowest number of social conflicts in the country according to the Peruvian Ombudsmans Report.  Any IFC investment in any future mining development would be assessed as a new project and its categorization would be determined after the necessary due diligence.  Even without an additional investment, IFC would require any future mine development with major impacts to follow PS1 in its requirements for a full ESIA as well as independent monitoring of the projects social and environmental performance and stakeholder engagement.  Tinka will ensure that social and environmental assessment documents associated with such a development will be consistent with IFCs Performance Standards and EHS Guidelines and be publicly available and consulted upon in accordance with IFCs Access to Information Policy prior to the start of construction.","","","","",35873,"",B-BB - Zinc,"","","",""

The Project is located in a prolific mining district where producing mines like Cerro de Pasco (Volcan Cia Minera), Antamina (BHP-Glencore-Teck) and Colquijirca (El Brocal) have been operating for decades.  The Project is comprised of two deposits: Ayawilca (zinc) and Colquipucro (silver), developed under the same mineral concession.

Yet even at such stage, Tinka has brought tangible benefits for the surrounding communities by providing direct employment for the local population, as well as investing in social development programs in favor of the communities living in the Department of Pasco, a poor rural area in the highland Andes in Peru.  Should exploration lead to mine development and production, the developmental impacts will be notable.  Key expected benefits during mine construction and operation will include revenues to the national government through royalties and taxes, foreign currency from export revenues, significant direct and indirect employment, and enhanced social development programs.","","The mining sector has been the engine of Perus economic growth as it contributes more than 50% of the countrys exports and constitutes 20% of fiscal revenues.  It is a Government priority to attract and facilitate private investment to develop mineral resources, to generate revenues and continue reducing poverty.  The impacts of contributions from mining are notable in poor rural areas, in this case San Pedro de Pillao and Yanacocha, two communities located in the area of influence of the Ayawilca-Colquipucro project.Peru has an established mining framework with a mining law enacted in 1992 that guarantees perpetual tenure for mining rights which are granted on a first-come, first-serve basis.  Peru is a leader country in transparency and is the first compliant EITI country in Latin America, followed only by Guatemala. Moreover, Tinka is committed to transparency and high sustainability standards.  The Company has agreed to IFCs disclosure requirements for all material payments to the government as well as contracts that govern the terms and conditions under which these resources will be explored and developed.","(i) Access to Capital: IFC will provide long-term capital needed to fund additional exploration activities and initial studies in the Ayawilca-Colquipucro project.

IFC is bringing in a unique blend of experience and knowledge of transportation and the integrated bus system in Bogota thereby providing a significant comfort and a stamp of approval of the Project to other lenders. <br>Political risk mitigation: Mass transport in Cartagena is extremely important for the majority of the city''s low income population. Mass transit related problems could be potentially politicized with the negative impact for private concessionaires. Therefore, Transambiental and its sponsors welcome IFC''s participation to help mitigate some of these risks. IBRD was involved in the structure of most intermediate cities mass transport systems and will provide support based on their experience on how to assess and mitigate the risk.","","","Transambiental S.A.S. main shareholders are T-Caribe Holdings (63%) and Organización SUMA (37%).

The company is currently focused on its wholly-owned Yaoure gold project (Yaoure or the project) in Côte dIvoire. Amara released a Preliminary Economic Assessment for Yaoure in March 2014 showing positive project economics. Since then, Amara completed an extensive drilling program (85 000 m) between April and October 2014. There are currently no drilling activities at the project site though grade control and infill drilling campaigns will be undertaken as part of the planned Bankable Feasibility Study (BFS). The company is expected to deliver a positive Prefeasibility Study (PFS) in April 2015 which will then lead to a BFS in Q4 2015. Current work is focused on metallurgical test to confirm recovery rate and reagent consumption.The project site is a brownfield which has previously been in production twice  once beginning in 1999 by Compagnie Miniere dAfrique (CMA) and then again in 2008 by Cluff Gold plc (Cluff). Amara acquired the CMA project in 2004. The purchase was made, under Amaras previous name, Cluff, which was formed in 2003 (the company subsequently changed its name to Amara Mining plc in October 2012). In 2011, Amara put the mine onto care and maintenance due to the political uncertainty in Cote dIvoire at that time. The current status of the project is that infill drilling is being undertaken to update the resource estimate with the aim of recommencing mining through the expansion of the former CMA and Cluff project as Yaoure. A significant amount of infrastructure and services from the previous mining activities remains in place.The project comprises two exploration licenses and is located in central Côte dIvoire, 40 km northwest of Yamoussoukro, the political capital, and 270 km north-west of Abidjan, the economic capital. There are five villages (NDa KoffiYabouekro, Akakro, Kouakougnanou, Angovia, and Allahou-Bazi) in close proximity to the project of which the closest are Angovia and Allahou-Bazi which lie approximately 500m east of the old pit. The five villages have an estimated combined population of 15 000. Agriculture is the main livelihood activity of the local community with crops such as rice, cocoa, yam, plantain, cassava, coffee being cultivated. The community also undertakes animal husbandry on a small scale. The area receives an average annual rainfall of around 1 000 mm. Fishing, which used to thrive on the nearby Lake Kossou, reduced significantly due to low productivity. Artisanal mining activities within the vicinity of the project, which are discussed further below, have a history that can reportedly be traced back to the 19th century. An IFC equity investment is proposed to support Amara to complete the BFS by Q4 2015. Successful completion of the BFS will be followed by: decision to proceed/not proceed; project funding; engineering design & procurement; and construction and production. Any IFC investment post BFS, i.e. potential future mine development undertaken by the company, will be assessed as a new project and its categorization would be determined after the necessary due diligence.Amara, through its local subsidiary in Burkina Faso, Seguénéga Mining SA (SMSA) Mining plc, operated the Kalsaka/Sega Gold mine. In August 2014, the company announced the cessation of all mining activities at Kalsaka/Sega Gold Mine. The operation was subsequently put into liquidation. This followed the receipt of a default notice to SMSA from the mining contractor at Kalsaka/Sega. According to the same announcement Amara was due to begin the closure of its two subsidiaries in Burkina Faso in Q4 2014 prior to the default notice. Thus, while the default notice accelerated this event, it did not represent a material change to the companys strategy for Kalsaka/Sega. The company also owns the Baomahun project in Sierra Leone which remains in an evaluative phase with limited activity at site due to the Ebola outbreak.","","","","IFCs environmental and social due diligence of this project consisted of appraising technical, environmental, health, safety and social information submitted by the company. It also included a visit to the project site where visits were organized to different areas of the project namely: the previously mined out pit; heap leach pads; workshop; potential future areas of major infrastructure placement (processing plant, tailings management facility and waste rock dump etc.); semi-mechanized artisanal mining site by Chinese nationals; several artisanal mining sites; and nearby Angovia-Allahou Bazi and Kouakougnanou villages. The team also met with the Community Consultative Committee (CCC) and a consultant from AMEC, Amaras Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) consultant.","","","","","","","","","","","","This is a category B project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure because the environmental and social (E&S) impacts of the exploration project are limited, site specific and therefore manageable through implementation of appropriate mitigation measures. This categorization is based on the impacts of the PFS and BFS activities noted above. The key E&S issues include noise, dust and emissions; surface and groundwater and soil pollution; management of fuel, oil and waste; transportation safety management; occupational and community health and safety, etc. which are reversible and can be properly mitigated by Amara. The company currently manages its impacts mainly through implementation of its Environmental Management System (EMS) and Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) management system. The EMS and OHS management systems were developed and implemented successfully during mining operations between 2008 and 2011. These comprehensive documents comprise equally comprehensive policies and procedures and compare favorably to IFCs Health, Safety, Environment, Labor and Community  HSEC - Policy which was designed mostly for junior mining companies. In addition to this, the company maintains a good working relationship with the local community through the CCC and government authorities.","","","","",34822,"",B-BE - Gold,"","","",""

Yaoure is the largest undeveloped gold project in the country in terms of mineral resources with total NI 43-101 compliant resources of 6.8 million ounces (Moz), including 4.4 Moz indicated (106.3 Mt @ 1.29 g/t Au) and 2.4 Moz inferred (63 Mt @ 1.19 g/t Au) based on a US$1,500 / oz pit shell and a cut-off grade of 0.5 g/t Au. The Company completed a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) in March 2014 to assess the potential for future mine development. Results from the PEA indicate that Yaoure has robust economics and as such, the Company is proceeding to complete a Prefeasibility Study (PFS) which is due at the end of April 2015. Amara is then expected to complete an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and a Bankable Feasibility Study (BFS) by the end of 2015, the final milestone to confirm the commercial viability of the deposit.","","",Discussions between IFC and Amara are on-going to determine how IFC could best assist with advisory services.,"","The key E&S issues include noise, dust and emissions; surface and groundwater and soil pollution; management of fuel, oil and waste; transportation safety management; occupational and community health and safety, etc. which are reversible and can be properly mitigated by Amara. Please see the Environmental and Social Review Summary (ESRS) for more information.","The proposed investment is an early-stage investment preceding final feasibility studies of the deposit''s commercial viability. Generally, exploration projects have limited near-term development impact. Should exploration lead to mine development and production, the developmental impact from this Project could be significant.  The mine could generate considerable revenues for the government, largely in the form of corporate income taxes and royalties. Once operational, the Project is expected to contribute 0.5% of revenues to a community development fund targeted at funding projects to benefit local communities. The development of a gold mine would also help to diversify the country''s export base from agricultural commodities.","","Governance has been weak in the country, as captured by various governance metrics, including the World Bank Governance Indicators and Transparency International. However, the government has placed a priority on improving governance and transparency and has taken steps to strengthen its regulatory framework, licensing, management and enforcement of mineral rights as demonstrated by the introduction of a new mining code.  Côte d''Ivoire also became EITI compliant in 2013. In addition, given the early stage nature of the Project and limited benefits at this point, especially in terms of fiscal revenues, any potential governance risks to Project benefits are deemed limited in the near term. Also, the Company has agreed to comply with IFCs disclosure requirements for material contracts related to the Project and revenues.","IFC''s role is expected to include: (i) providing access to equity capital. IFC will provide long-term risk equity capital to the Company, as it is advancing the Project to the Bankable Feasibility Study stage at a time when most mining companies find it difficult to access capital markets. (ii) Advising Amara on environmental and social performance standards. (iii) Amara is keen to leverage IFC''s knowledge of the project finance market as well as our ability to provide debt / mezzanine financing at the construction stage.","","","Amara Mining plc was formed in November 2003 and is publicly listed on the London Stock Exchange''s AIM with a market capitalization of GBP63 million as of April 7, 2015 (420 million shares at GBP0.15 per share). Amaras ownership is primarily composed of institutional investors such as Aurum Holdings (15.2%), Franklin Templeton (13.7%), Ingalls and Snyder (7.4%), JP Morgan (7.4%), Tembo Capital (6%) and others.

Similarly, any future land acquisition by Credence for the proposed project is not expected to have PS5 impacts. The 2 project sites planned for acquisition in Cairo are not expected to trigger PS6 as they will be selected in commercial zones. The Hurghada project site lies on migratory bird flyways. However, the project site is highly developed and the proposed development is not expected to have significant impacts on Biodiversity. Hence, PS 6 is not triggered.

CHO Group is the largest olive oil milling operation in Tunisia and has vertically integrated operations, from orchards and olive fields to mills, refineries, accredited laboratory, and state of the art packaging facilities. The core business of CHO is to sell various grades of olive oil and by-products of olive oil processing: 1) virgin olive oil (both bio certified and non-certified, representing approximately 20% certified), filtered and bottled or sold in bulk; 2) refined oil (processed from pure olive oil or extracted olive residue oil), filtered and bottled or sold in bulk; 3) biofuel from waste olive residue; and 4) household soap and liquid soap using oil refining by-product. To this end, the company purchases pressed olive oil from third-party mills (70% in 2014) as well as from its own mills (30%), and CHO exclusively relies on external farmers for olive production as the company's own orchard produces only 2% of its total olive demand. CHO activities entail: a small olive tree orchard; olive pressing at one company owned facility; olive residue pressing (both physical and chemical extraction) at two company owned sites; oil refining; bottling; soap processing; procurement of olives, oil and olive residue; warehousing/storage of oil and operation of an International Olive Council certified laboratory.Company operations are located on the Mediterranean coast near the town of Sfax, which is approximately 230 km south of the capital city Tunis. The region of Sfax is an important olive-growing zone for Tunisia and accounts for 30 percent of the country's olive crop. Company activities are conducted across multiple operational units: 1) 100 hectare site, irrigated and planted in 2011 with 22,000 trees; 2) three company-owned olive presses and currently four additional ones are rented (pressing of bio-certified and non-certified olives kept separate). Waste material from the olive press is used as an input for the extraction facilities; 3) bottling facility for extra virgin olive oil (5 production lines for filling bio certified and non-certified product) and a refinery for processing 'second grade' oil and olive residue oil into an edible oil. Waste material from the refinery is used as an input for the soap processing facility; 4) and 5) physical and chemical extraction of olive residue oil at two sites (El Amra and Chrarda) to provide input oil for the refinery. Waste material from this process is transformed into a combustible material and used as a source of biofuel across the Company's operations and all surplus is exported; 6) soap processing facility to transform waste by-product from refinery into various household grade soaps and liquid soaps; and 7) bulk oil warehousing facility to centralize procurement and mixing of all types of oil prior to bottling or bulk resale for export.

The project will be developed by Sonker Bunkering Company (Sonker), which was established in 2003 as a petroleum import, storage, handling, bunkering and blending company. Sonker is a public-private partnership jointly owned by Amiral (63%), Misr Petroleum Company (15%), the Egyptian Ministry of Finance (12%) and Cooperative Petroleum Company (10%). The development of the LBT is part of the basin 3 port concession that was signed between DP World Sokhna (DPWS) and the Red Sea Port Authority (RSPA) in 2006 which was further amended and re-signed in March 2015.The project consists of the construction and operation of a dedicated LBT in Sokhna Port, Egypt, with adequate equipment and storage capacity for the handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and Gasoil imports, berthing of Floating Storage and Regasification Units (FSRU) for LNG imports; and operation of a jetty for import and export of oil and gas products, and chemicals.The project will include the construction of three Gasoil tanks (total capacity of 100,000 m3), three LPG tanks (total capacity of 150,000 m3), a LPG pipeline (4.3 km), a Gasoil pipeline connecting to the national grid via Mina Sadat (37.5 km), and related infrastructure. The LBT will also berth a Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU) with a storage capacity of 170,000 m3 rented by the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (EGAS) from Hoegh LNG under a five year rental contract. The FSRU arrived in April 2015 and following testing for the LNG pipelines it started operating and feeding the national grid since mid-April 2015. The LBT currently includes an operational jetty and two ammonia tanks. The jetty is a free concrete structure, standing on piles in the water. It is designed to provide access for vessels with a capacity of up to 120,000 deadweight tonnage. The ammonia tanks are for temporary storage of exported ammonia product. Loading and unloading of tankers will take place using loading arms, linking the tank farm to the jetty.The FSRU within the scope of the project will serve as a temporary storage of LNG in its cryogenic tanks, and conduct regasification of the LNG, and compress the natural gas after regasification and deliver the Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) into the national grid pipeline. The FSRU is operated by Hoegh and the pipelines by EGAS.The FSRU will use seawater to heat and evaporate the LNG. After regasification the natural gas is compressed to approximately 80 bar and delivered through loading arms installed on the jetty into the national grid for distribution to the consumers in the country.The FSRU has a regasification capacity of approximately 4 million tons (8 million m3) of LNG per year. The LNG will be delivered to the FSRU by a LNG Carrier (LNGC). The LNGC is moored alongside the FSRU and transfers its cargo load through a number of cryogenic flexible hoses into the tanks of the FSRU. The LNGC has capacity of about 170,000 m3. To enable the safe maneuvering and mooring of the LNGC alongside the FSRU the Basin 3 of Sokhna Port had to be widened through dredging by approximately 70m.

Cullinan (the mine) is a 112-year old mine that was acquired by Petra Diamonds Limited (Petra) from De Beers in 2008. Petra has been an IFC client since 2005. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is geographically diversified with four producing mines in South Africa (Finsch, Cullinan, Koffiefontein and Kimberley Underground), one producing mine in Tanzania (Williamson), and one exploration project in Botswana (Petra Diamonds Botswana).The installation of the new processing plant (the project) which officially commences in the fourth quarter of FY 2014, is expected to be commissioned in FY 2017. Cullinan will continue to operate the old plant until the new plant is fully commissioned at which point the old plant will be decommissioned and subsequently dismantled. The new plant, with a significantly reduced footprint  4ha - will be installed within the existing plants footprint. The current plant has a footprint of about 27ha. Energy and water resource efficiencies are discussed under PS3 below. Any environmental and social impacts that may arise as part of the project will be addressed through the EMP amendment exercise that the mine has commissioned. Cullinan is located in the eastern region of the Gauteng Province, some 37km east of Pretoria. The majority (65%) of its workforce comes from local (within a 50 km radius) particularly from Refilwe, a nearby settlement. Of the remaining 35%, the majority of employees come from the greater Gauteng province whilst a small number constitutes workers from outside of the Gauteng province and neighboring countries. Bronkhorstspruit and Onverwacht are other nearby settlements in addition to the town of Cullinan. The main land use in the greater region is intensive agriculture with livestock grazing in some parts. Farms in the area are generally small. Several smaller businesses and industry also occur in the area. Cullinan, and the mine itself, are regarded as a tourist attraction for the area and promote ecotourism. The mine supports small and medium enterprise initiatives within the Cullinan area. The mine is located in a typical Highveld climatic region, with warm to hot summers, moderate winters and rainfall that are higher than that of most parts of the country. The area receives most of its rainfall in the summer months between October and March. The average annual rainfall for the period from June 2001 to February 2012 is 599.14mm. The mine is situated in the upper catchment areas of the Premiermynloop and the McHardyspruit, which form part of the Pienaars River sub-system.Diamonds were first discovered at Cullinan in 1902 and open pit mining commenced in 1903. The mine was closed between 1937 and 1945 due to the economic downturn, and was re-opened to mine underground in 1947. The current mining method used is mechanized block-caving. In addition to the primary resource of the Kimberlite pipe, old course residue deposits (tailings) are additional mineral resources that are currently being reprocessed. Cullinans current surface operational areas consist of headgear infrastructure, a processing plant area, workshops, administration infrastructure, waste rock dumps, about 165 million tons of coarse residue deposits and fine residue deposits. This infrastructure is linked with Eskom power lines, tar and gravel roads.The treatment process used at Cullinan consists of three basic stages: ore preparation by crushing, washing and screening; concentration of the sized material and preparation by means of dense media separation; and sorting. The existing treatment plant was commissioned in 1947 and has since undergone considerable modifications and additions.","","","","The review of this project consisted of appraising technical, environmental, health, safety and social information submitted by the company, and assessing the companys operations by a field visit conducted by the project team. Key focus was a review of management systems and organization, including review of Cullinan Diamond Mines approved Environmental Management Program (EMP) - the outcome of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for mining projects in South Africa; Environmental Management Systems (EMS); Integrated Water and Waste Management Plan (IWWMP); approved Social and Labor Plan (SLP); Rehabilitation and Closure Plan; and key monitoring data. The IFC team visited the mine on the 2nd of April, and met key mine representatives. Field visits were organized to different parts of the mining areas as well as to ancillary infrastructure and to one of the mines community development projects. Various discussions were also held with key representatives from Petra Diamonds Limited.IFCs appraisal considered environmental and social (E&S) management plans for the project and gaps, if any, between these plans and IFC requirements. Cullinan, like all other Petra operations, has demonstrated strong commitment to meeting international best practice standards through compliance with the IFC Performance Standards as well as adherence to the strong, well enforced South African environmental laws, regulations and requirements. In particular, the Mineral Resources and Petroleum Development Act (MPRDA) of 2002 and the National Environmental Management Act (NEMA) of 1998 are both used to guide practice, as well as various international best practice standards. The EMP is a legally binding document for which performance is regularly reviewed and the mine is certified for ISO 140001. Thus, given the proposed project is a replacement of a plus 60 year old processing plant with a new one and no gaps were identified during this appraisal against IFC PS requirements, IFC is satisfied that the project will be operated in accordance with PS objectives, without any requirement for an Environmental and Social Action Plan.","","","","","","","","","","","","Cullinan, like all other Petra operations, has in place an EMS which is based on ISO 140001, regulatory requirements and the site specific conditions at Cullinan. The mine is ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certified. The mining operations were found to be already broadly in compliance with the IFC Performance Standards from observations during the site visit and data provided by the mine. The mine is an existing brownfield mine and the IFC investment will contribute to the funding of the replacement of a plus 60 year old processing plant with an advanced processing plant with better energy and water efficiencies within the same surface footprint. Thus, the investment will not result in any significant new impacts. Pre-existing E&S issues associated with the project include: occupational and community health and safety; dust control; waste management, including hazardous waste and management of mine residue deposits; water management; public safety, hazardous materials management and mitigation of transportation risks on roads leading to the site. No overall reduction in labor is envisaged in the next five years. Instead there will be redeployment and upskilling resulting in flat employment in near term.Thus, this is a Category B project according to IFCs procedures for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because the project only involves replacement of an old plant on an existing brownfield site, within the same footprint, by an existing IFC client with good E&S performance and therefore has limited adverse impacts and risks which are manageable. The project requires a public disclosure period of at least 30 days prior to consideration by the IFC Board.","","","","",36729,"",B-CC - Diamonds and Other Gems,"","","",""

Cullinan is a 112-year old mine that was acquired by Petra Diamonds Limited (Petra) from De Beers in 2008. Since then, Petra has spent $357 million with a further $250 million planned capital expenditures, to increase production from 0.8 million carats in 2009 to a targeted 2.2 Mcts by 2019. Cullinan has an initial mine life to 2030, but the potential mine life is +50 years with a gross resource of 200 Mcts. The replacement of the processing plant will enable increased ore tonnage to be treated more efficiently and is expected to result in higher recoveries through the use of better technology. The processing circuit will be simplified and will include the use of advanced diamond recovery technology, including autogenous milling, high pressure grinding rolls technology and XRF x-ray machines. The current plant has a ROM throughput capacity of 2.8 million tons per annum while the replacement plant will have a 6.0 mtpa ROM capacity. Petra also aims to simplify and streamline the processing route and reduce the existing plant footprint of 25.6ha down to 4.9ha (with 15km of conveyor belts being reduced to 3km). Operating efficiencies and security improvements will be driven through increased automation, reduced tons in circulation and improved energy efficiencies, with an expected improvement in energy efficiency per ton. Based on these efficiencies, the Company will target overall direct cash cost savings of up to ZAR15 per ton treated.","","",Petra is potentially interested in IFC's Advisory Services' support on the establishment of a charitable foundation.

This is achieved through engagements with external stakeholders (such as local municipalities and the regulator, the Department of Mineral Resources) in terms of the Local Economic Development Plan spend as well as engagements with internal stakeholders (e.g., unions) and other stakeholders  through the mine-level Corporate Social Investment committees for discretionary spend. IFC has reviewed potential governance risks to project benefits and has concluded that these are manageable.The mining tax and general legislative framework in South Africa is well developed and complimentary. The South African Revenue Service is responsible for levying and collecting mineral royalties. These are published in the budget review as part of non-tax revenue (although not at the company level). The DMR also has its own internal process and procedures to perform audits on the information provided to them by mining companies. The DMR may also release information though this would be on an industry basis. Petra will also disclose all material payments to government and South Africa is a member of the Kimberley Process, which requires similar disclosure.With respect to direct spending on community development, Petra views the support of the community as integral to the success of the Cullinan operation (and indeed all its operations) and is committed to community development. The implementation of the Cullinan LEDP is being managed by an on mine steering committee which is made up of representatives from the local municipality, various government departments and on mine specialists.","IFC''s Expected Additionality will include: (i) Stamp of approval: IFC''s involvement as an anchor investor will provide comfort to potential long-term investors. IFC is the only anchor investor and a willingness to take up a significant portion of the bond offering is a positive signal to other investors, especially for a first time issuer; (ii) Long-term partnership: Petra is a repeat client since 2005 with projects in South Africa, Botswana and Tanzania. IFC is both a lender to and an equity investor in Petra. Petra considers IFC''s continuing support to be a comparative advantage and IFC''s role as an anchor investor in Petra''s debut bond offering was specifically requested by Petra; (iii) Other value added services: Petra has expressed interest in IFC''s Advisory Services support on the establishment of a charitable foundation.

Total project cost for the next eight years is estimated at ~330 million. Setrag, operator of the Transgabonais railroad (which construction started in 1973), was established in 2003. The management contract awarded to Setrag was expanded into a 30-year concession contract starting in November 2005. Setrag is 99%-owned by Compagnie Minière de lOgooué (Comilog), the second largest producer of manganese in the world with circa 15% of the worlds production and part of Eramet group, a French mining and metallurgical company. It operates the Moanda mining site in the Haut-Ogooué province of Gabon as well as the Transgabonais through its subsidiary Setrag. Comilog is not considered an associated facility to this project under IFC PS 1 as both the railway and mine already exist and because the railway deals with commercial goods and passengers in addition to mine output.Funds are intended to support rehabilitation of the existing infrastructure (replacement of approximately 600 km of rails and sleepers); acquisition of new rolling stock for replacement and expansion of transport capacity; refurbishment of railway stations, unstable zones, bridges and worker accommodations (approximately 300 houses); drainage improvement along the corridor; building of new signage  and improvement of level crossings. Most of the works will be completed by 2022, whilst maintenance will continue until 2035. This project is confined to the existing railway corridor, i.e.  a safety corridor stretching 15 m on either side of the existing railway tracks plus land already acquired for other existing infrastructure, and will not result in any new footprint or habitat fragmentation. The legal right of way for the railway extends 40 m on either side of the centerline of the tracks, but due to potential social impacts on encroachers and presence of sensitive habitat in the National Park section, it has been decided to restrict the works area to the more restricted safety corridor.In the next 5 years, there will be an increase in freight transport from 1 million tons to 1.6 million tons including a slight increase in fuel transport (10%). No major increase in manganese transport from Comilog is expected although the Ndjolé mine operated by Chinese company CITIC Dameng and the Franceville mine currently developed by New Gabon Mining will increase their manganese transport respectively from 360,000 to 500,000 tons and from 75,000 to 360,000 tons.

The IFC loan will contribute to financing (i) the rollout of the companys national 3G Mobile Network in Myanmar; (ii) license payment; and (iii) operating expenses.  Ooredoo received its 15 year, renewable licenin February 2014 from the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology.  The Ooredoo licenses consist of; a Spectrum License for the assignment of Mobile Frequencies and a National Telecommunications License. Ooredoo launched its 3G mobile network in August 2014 with coverage in 68 cities and towns, including Yangon, Nay Pyi Taw and Mandalay, covering some 7.8M people. The company primarily leases space on telecommunications towers that are built, owned and operated by independent tower companies at locations specified by Ooredoo. The installation and testing of Ooredoos telecom equipment and on-site generators is undertaken by contracted radio access network vendors. Ooredoos telecommunications equipment and generators are maintained by contracted service providers.Ooredoo operates two data center warehouses in leased premises in Yangon and Mandalay, as well as offices and shops in Yangon, Mandalay,  Nay Pyi Taw and other towns and cities across the coverage area. As of February, 2015 Ooredoo was the anchor tenant for approximately 1,400 telecommunications towers in operation in Myanmar, mostly situated in highly populated areas including Yangon, Mandalay and Nay Pyi Taw and along major roads networks. These telecommunications towers were installed over the 12 month period to February 2015, forming a part of the initial order Ooredoo has placed with two tower companies for the roll-out of an initial 2,500 telecommunications tower locations.","","","","IFC has reviewed technical information provided by Ooredoo Myanmar Ltd (Ooredoo or the Company), a telecommunications operator with country headquarters in Yangon, Myanmar.  The scope of IFCs appraisal included a review of Ooredoos management capacity to provide adequate oversight of environmental, social, health and safety aspects of its operations.  The review relied on documents and independent reports made available by Ooredoo, along with site visits during January 2015, by IFCs technical team to a number of Ooredoos sites in Yangon, including a Network Operations Center, Ooredoos main offices and a number of telecommunications tower sites at which Ooredoo is an anchor tenant within the greater Yangon area, Myanmar.  Interviews were conducted by IFC staff during meetings with Ooredoos human resources, legal and senior management in Yangon.  IFCs appraisal considered Ooredoos existing environmental and social management policy and management system documentation, along with procurement and site acquisition processes for the project and gaps, if any, between these plans and IFC requirements. Where necessary, corrective measures intending to close these gaps within a reasonable period of time are summarized in the paragraphs that follow and in the agreed Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP), disclosed along with this review summary.

Given there are no major adverse environmental or social impacts expected to result from the proposed project, and it is possible to avoid or mitigate any limited adverse impacts that may arise, the proposed investment has been classified as a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects.All of IFCs Performance Standards are applicable to IFC investments. However, IFCs E&S due diligence indicates that the construction and operation activities covered by the proposed investment will have to be managed in a manner consistent with the following Performance Standards: PS 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts; PS 2: Labor and Working Conditions; and PS 4: Community Health, Safety and Security. PS3 (Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention) is not applicable as energy supply for Ooredoos operations are prioritized, where possible, from the national grid.  .  PS5 (Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement) is not applicable as Ooredoo leases space on telecommunications towers that are owned and operated by third party telecommunications tower companies.  Leases for the telecommunications towers are based on a willing buyer/ willing seller basis.  PS6 (Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources) is not considered applicable given that, due to the limited footprint of the individual towers, no operations are expected to require biodiversity conservation or management of living natural resources.  PS7 (Indigenous Peoples) is not considered applicable as although various ethnic groups exist across Myanmar, the construction and operation of telecom towers is not expected to result in the transformation, encroachment or degradation of indigenous community lands.  On PS8 (Cultural Heritage), whilst sacred sites are common in the region, no impacts to cultural resources have been identified to date.  The company will implement avoidance measures to ensure impacts to sites involving high biodiversity value or significant cultural heritage are prevented at the site selection stages.  Similarly a chance finds procedure will be applied in the event of discovering cultural heritage resources in the project area.","","","","",34170,"",N-AC - Mobile Telephony,"","","",""

The Group has 3 cement plants in Nigeria,  6 in other African countries and is in the process of developing cement production operations in another 8 African countries; the latter are in varying stages of development.  In addition to this, the Group has salt processing activities in Nigeria and manufactures sacks required for the storage of materials produced across the various operations.  Further, the company operates a port terminal in Apapa, Lagos, via which goods required for its operations are imported and products manufactured from the various operations exported. The Group is also in the process of developing an oil refinery and a fertilizer plant which will be located adjacent to each other in the Lekki Free Trade Zone (LFTZ), some 50 km east of the center of Lagos, Nigeria.  Initially in early 2015 IFC was considering a $150 million loan to the Group to support the fertilizer plant and the Environmental and Social Review Summary (ESRS) document was published on this basis.  Thereafter, in May 2015 the ESRS was updated to reflect that the majority of the proceeds would be directed towards the fertilizer plant with the remainder to support pre-construction design and feasibility work for the oil refinery.  However, as of April 2016 and following discussions between Dangote and IFC, it has been agreed that the use of proceeds would revert to that originally defined.  As such, all funds will be used to support establishment of the fertilizer plant and there will be no investment directed towards the oil refinery. Thus the ESRS has subsequently been updated again to reflect this approach. The LFTZ is some 16,500 hectares (ha) in extent and is situated in the Lekki Peninsula with the Atlantic Ocean to the south and the Lekki lagoon to the north.  The master plan for the entire area includes a new airport, heavy and light industrial areas, commercial and residential areas and a new sea port, amongst other specific designated use areas. For the most part though, the LFTZ is presently undeveloped aside from a few small industrial facilities and an internal road network; the fertilizer plant is the first major development and located within an area designated for heavy industrial use.    The fertilizer plant will occupy 200 ha and the main project components involve; i) two, 2,200 metric ton per day (MTPD) ammonia plants; ii) two, 3,850 MPD urea plants; and iii) two, 3,850 MTPD urea granulation plants.  The total production capacity of the plant will be some 2.8 million tons per year of granulated urea.   Ammonia produced by the associated plants will be fed directly to the urea plants. In the event the urea plants are not operational, the ammonia will be fed to a 20,000 ton intermediate storage tank before later use in urea production. In addition to the fertilizer plants primary production facilities, all utilities required for the operations such as power, air, nitrogen, water supply and effluent treatment will be provided via on-site facilities also to be constructed as part of the broader plant development.  Natural gas required for production activities and the power plant will be supplied via a new gas pipeline to be constructed.  The location of the gas pipeline is yet to be confirmed; however it is currently envisaged to be some 50 km in length and will link into an existing trunk gas line operated by the Nigerian Gas Company.  The gas itself will be provided by a private supplier and Dangote is in discussions with respective companies on this issue. Transfer of urea from the fertilizer plant will be by road via the existing road network.  In the vicinity of LFTZ the road network is to be upgraded by the Lagos State Government and this includes improving linkages into the city of Lagos and beyond.  In addition, as part of the LFTZ a port is planned which will be located immediately south of the plant and fertilizer will be exported from this port once operational.  However, until such time, the fertilizer will be exported via the port terminal operated by Dangote in Apapa, Lagos. Dangote has appointed Saipem, an Italian based company experienced in fertilizer plants, as the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contractor and there are various other companies either involved on behalf of Dangote and Saipem as outlined in subsequent sections of this document.

('CARD Bank') and CARD SME Bank, Inc. ('CARD SME'), of which (i) up to PHP540 million (US$12 million) to CARD Bank and (ii) up to PHP160 million (US$4 million) senior loan to CARD SME, with maturity of up to 7 years (including 1 year grace period). Both CARD Bank and CARD SME are important lenders to the underbanked rural MSME sector in the Philippines.  Through the investment IFC will support CARD Bank and CARD SME to expand their services in order to provide micro finance solutions to small businesses and individuals in rural areas.CARD Bank, Inc. was set up in September 1997 and now is the largest microfinance institution in the Philippines with a customer base of 1.4 million of which around 90% are women. CARD Bank offers a range of products for the micro-entrepreneurs such as savings and loan products and micro-insurance through a distribution network of 61 branches/area/regional offices and 380 office units/service units throughout the country as of March 2015. CARD SME Bank, Inc. formerly known as the Rural Bank of Sto. Tomas (Batangas), Inc. (RBSTI), started operations in 1962. CARD SME's customers are comprised primarily of customers who have 'graduated' from the microfinance bank, CARD Bank.  CARD SME helps facilitate the transition of these micro-entrepreneurs to small businesses and addresses a gap not being filled by the commercial banks, as these microfinance clients build capacity and eventually graduate to SMEs.  CARD SME also services the micro-entrepreneurs in the area where CARD SME's branches are located. As of March 2015, CARD SME had 11 branches/area/regional offices and 120 office units/service units servicing 228 thousand clients.","","","IFC Advisory Services signed a cooperation agreement with CARD Bank in 2007 (550225) to develop an SME lending platform.  This engagement covered a technical advisory for CARD to put up an SME operation  from risk assessment and credit scoring to marketing and strategy.  When RBSTI (CARD SME) was acquired in 2008, all the SME loans were then booked under this entity.  The original agreement, which expired in 2010, was extended by one year to 2011 (550225).  The second phase focused on refining the initiatives made during the first phase of the advisory, such as their credit scoring tool, portfolio scoring tool, features of the loan products and trainings. In July 2013, IFC signed a cooperation agreement with CARD SME on agri-finance advisory (577567).  The advisory will help CARD SME design and rollout an agri-finance strategy in the Philippines.  Part of the engagement involves evaluation of lending opportunities in selected agricultural value chains and then testing this through the implementation of an agricultural lending pilot.  In April 2014, IFC also signed a cooperation agreement with CARD  Pioneer Microinsurance and CARD, Inc. (599889). The project aims to assist CARD  Pioneer to create an index-based portfolio insurance product, and further develop an existing indemnity insurance product being rolled out in CARD Inc. to address typhoon-related risks faced by both lenders and farmers.  In January 2015, IFC signed a phase II agri-finance cooperation agreement with CARD SME (577567). The project aims to support CARD SME in rolling out the agri-finance business model introduced in the first advisory to 4 other branches. The approach will allow CARD SME to expand its financial services into target regions, and reach more farmers and value chain players in different commodities. The project is also expected to increase loan officer productivity and capacity in assessing risks in agri-finance.","","The main E&S risks and impacts of the project derive from the E&S risks of the Banks lending activities, the capacity and systems in place to manage these risks, and the Banks practices with regard to labor and working conditions. At present CARD Bank and CARD SME do not have an  Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) outlining the procedures, responsibilities and tools for undertaking E&S risk management of its lending activities and E&S related due diligence is not yet part of the Banks loan review process. No staff/department has been assigned responsibility for E&S due diligence and monitoring, and training needs to be provided to all staff involved in ESMS implementation. CARD Bank and CARD SME were found to be broadly in compliance with the requirements of PS2 on Labor and Working conditions.","-	Increasing access to finance products for small entrepreneurs, SMEs and individuals, especially women in rural areas. -	Improving the rural banking sector by bringing in best practices in MSME lending, risk management and corporate governance.",<table><tr><th>Indicator</th><th>Metrics</th><th>Calendar Year 2017</th><th>Calendar Year 2018</th></tr><tr><td>CORE - E and S Management Systems (Y/N)</td><td>Compliance/Enhancement</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Access to Finance: Outstanding Microfinance Portfolio (#)</td><td>Outstanding Portfolio (#)</td><td>2124667</td><td>3973595</td></tr><tr><td>Access to Finance: Outstanding Microfinance Portfolio ($)</td><td>Outstanding Portfolio ($)</td><td>214432821.73</td><td>263075524</td></tr></table><br><br><table><tr><td>The above table reflects aggregate figures or assessments from across the company's associated projects with IFC.</td></tr></table>,"","-	Supporting the clients with advisory services, particularly in up-scaling from microfinance to SME lending and agribusiness finance, risk management and corporate governance.<br>-	Providing long-term funding which is not readily available in the Philippines to rural thrift banks.<br>-	Providing access to IFC's global microfinance and SME expertise and to a network of IFC's microfinance clients worldwide.","","","CARD Bank, Inc. is 29% owned by CARD, Inc., 6% owned by CARD Employees Multi-Purpose Cooperative ('CARD EMPC'), the Cooperative of all CARD MRI staff and around 42% owned by CARD Bank's staff, management and executives.CARD SME Bank, Inc. is 33.8% owned by CARD, Inc., 31.5% owned by CARD EMPC, 28.8% by BOD/Executives/Management and 5.8% owned by Sparkassen International Development Trust ('SIDT'), a German savings bank association.

As we proceed with the engagement, IFC Advisory will discuss with Vitol opportunities for engagement.","","","Ghana faces a shortage of reasonably priced fuel for power generation. Most hydropower potential is already developed, so the bulk of Ghana's future power generation capacity will rely on natural gas. Interruption in gas availability in the recent past has necessitated purchases of up to US$50 million per month of light crude oil as fuel supply for power plants. In this context, exploiting OCTP's natural gas reserves will be a game changer for Ghana's energy sector. The Project will provide enough gas to fire up to 1,000 MW, representing ~25% of Ghana's total estimated power generation capacity in 2020. The OCTP Project will therefore substitute expensive, higher emission liquid fuels currently used by the power sector of Ghana by cleaner and cheaper gas resources. As such, the Project will directly contribute to enhancing the availability of natural gas as a source for relatively cleaner power generation in Ghana, at a time when gas production from other fields in Ghana is expected to start to decline.

The proposed IFC investment is for refinancing BCLs existing debt and supporting additional improvement capex and long term working capital requirements in the company.  BCL owns and operates an integrated 0.95 million tons per annum (MTPA) cement plant at Gudipadu village, Yadiki Mandalam, 25 km from Tadipatri, in Anantpur district of the state of Andhra Pradesh, India (the plant).   Construction of the plant commenced in 2009 and it was commissioned in January 2012. The plant has vertical roller mills for coal crushing and raw meal preparation, a rotary kiln with a 6-stage pre-heater and pre-calciner, horizontal grate cooler and a ball mill for clinker grinding. The plant also has 2 rotopacker lines and two bag loading machines. The plant also has a coal based captive power plant (CPP) of 25 MW, which was commissioned in August 2013. The staff and many of the workers stay in the colony adjacent to the plant.The shareholders of BCL have entered into an agreement for transfer of BCLs ownership to Sagar Cements Limited (Sagar or the Sponsor), one of the cement manufacturing companies in South India with a capacity of about 2.75 MTPA, located in the state of Telangana. Sagar has; (a) 2.25 MTPA capacity integrated cement plant (with a captive limestone mine) in Mattampally village, in Nalgonda district of Telangana; and (b) 0.50 MTPA cement grinding plant (with a captive limestone mine) in Peddaveedu village in Nalgonda district of Andhra Pradesh. After the proposed change of ownership, BCL will become a subsidiary of Sagar. IFC financing will be subject to the transfer of ownership and completion of all regulatory formalities related to the transfer of ownership.BCL has applied for a limestone mining lease over an area of 1,123 acres located within 2 km from the plant boundary. The mining lease is currently in final stages of approval by the concerned government department. To date, the BCL plant has been operating intermittently, at less than 30% of the installed capacity with purchased limestone from nearby areas/mines and is manufacturing both Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) and Blended cement. With the acquisition of the company by Sagar and granting of the mining lease, the situation is expected to see a turnaround and the plant is to operate at full installed capacity in the near future (subject to market demand and business needs). The plant and mine are both located in Gudipadu village, with the village being located at 2.2 km from the plant and 700 m from the mine boundary. There are two other cement plants in the same area (i.e. within 10 km), which are owned by Penna and Ultratech respectively.  As the investment is for a defined use of proceeds i.e. refurbishment of the plant, increase in working capital and refinancing of existing debt, IFCs environmental and social (E&S) appraisal as described in the following sections focuses on operations of the plant within the context of the broader approach by Sagar for E&S management by the  sponsor.","","","","IFCs review of this proposed investment consisted of appraising technical, environmental, health and safety (EHS) and social related information submitted by the plant including: (a) EHS policies and procedures; (b) Human Resource (HR) policies and records; (c) environment impact assessment (EIA) report for the plant (dated 2008) and the mine (dated 2013); d) Livelihood restoration plan for the persons/families impacted by the land purchase for the mine (dated 2015); (e) land related documents; (f) environmental monitoring reports; (g) health and safety performance data/performance of the plant/mine; (h) corporate social responsibility (CSR) activity details; (i) relevant and applicable permits/licenses and approvals; (j) contractor management systems and practices and other relevant documentation; and (k) documents relating to Sagars operations - HR policies, Integrated Management Systems policies, procedures and management programs, EHS monitoring reports, copies of basic licenses and permits.

SCL is a relatively small player in the South Indian market with a cement manufacturing capacity of 2.75 MTPA spread across two plants located at Matampally and Pedaveedu in the Nalgonda district of the state of Telangana. SCLs turnaround plan for BCL includes (i) improving the operational efficiency of the plant through investing in (a) refurbishment of the plant, (b) in insurance spares and (c) in working capital; and (ii) restructuring the balance sheet by injecting long term capital including refinancing debt to extend maturities.. IFC proposes to part finance BCLs turnaround plans, subject to the transfer of ownership and completion of all regulatory formalities related to the transaction.","","","","","Key environmental and social (E&S) issues associated with this Project include: Companys capacity and systems to manage social, environmental, health and safety aspects of the plant operations in compliance with legal requirements as well as IFC Performance Standards (PSs) and World Bank Group (WBG) EHS guidelines; engagement with local communities in accordance with local requirements and IFC PSs; assurance of fair, safe and healthy working conditions in line with legal requirements as well as IFC PSs; management of wastes, emissions and effluents from its operations in compliance with WBG EHS guidelines (general as well as those for cement manufacturing); energy and water efficiency of the operations; life and fire safety (L&FS) management and emergency response; and livelihood maintenance and restoration for the project affected families/land sellers.",1.	Turnaround of an underperforming asset:  BCL is currently in financial stress. IFC will finance the turnaround by providing much needed long term capital to support the operations and allow future growth. This will not only help protect the existing jobs totaling in excess of 1500 but also create approximately 500 to 700 new direct and indirect jobs.  2.	Support a small regional player: The Project will support a regional cement manufacturer to expand its market and improve its access to raw material thereby increase its overall competitiveness in the sector.3.	Tax revenues: The Project is expected to contribute to the domestic economy through increased tax revenues. The annual tax payment for SCL at the consolidated level is projected at about US$ 3 million.,"","","1.	Access to long term finance: BMM requires long term capital with adequate repayment moratorium to match its cash flows till its turnaround. The proposed IFC investment will bridge this gap and provide the necessary financing to the company relevant under the current market conditions.<br><br>2.	Environmental & Social standard setting: By complying with IFC''s environmental, health, and safety (EHS) standards, the Company will improve its environment & social management system and cleaner production norms, which should enhance its reputation by reducing the risk of adverse impacts on local communities and help in its delivery of corporate social responsibility. <br><br>3.	Support Clean Energy & Resource efficiency initiatives: IFC also plans to undertake a detailed resource efficiency assessment of clinker manufacturing operations of the BMM facility to assess the various opportunities for energy savings, material savings, renewable energy options and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reduction. <br><br>4.	Global sector expertise: In its next phase of growth, parent Company SCL is also planning to expand outside India and looking at markets like Africa. SCL is likely to benefit from IFC''s presence and expertise in those markets.","","","BCL is currently a part of the South India based Bharat Mines & Minerals group (BMM group). It is a closely held company owned by the Singhi family based in Bengaluru, Karnataka. The BMM group has presence in mining, ore processing, steel manufacturing and power generation.

Specifically, the construction of a 300 person camp, bulk earthworks, including excavation of box-cut, and construction of the Tailings Storage Facility (TSF) and Water Storage Dam (WSD) have commenced. Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contractors for the processing plant have been identified and are expected to mobilize and start construction within the second quarter of 2015. Equally, underground contractors have been identified and are expected to mobilize and commence the establishment of the portal to access the deposit during the same period. The Yaramoko deposit will be exploited through underground mining accessed by a ramp. Mining will incorporate blast drilling and long hole open stoping extraction with backfilling if necessary. Preliminary underground mining simulations indicate an extraction rate of 750 tons per day (tpd)  being equivalent to 270 000 tons per annum (tpa) and a life of mine of 7.3 years. The process plant will be constructed in close proximity to the underground portal to minimize truck haulage costs. The treatment process will consist of primary crushing, grinding with a single-stage SAG mill, gravity concentration, classification, leaching and adsorption, tailings thickening, electro-winning, and smelting. Milling will be carried out using a conventional cyanide leach circuit.

With high countrywide coverage ratios, operators in Bangladesh have pushed access to internet over 2G connections via feature phones or low end smartphones. With increased availability of 3G services, subscribers will be able to experience enhanced services through high speed connections and lower latency. 2. Improved access to innovative services. With appropriate infrastructure deployed in the country, the Company will continue to diversify its revenue and strengthen its VAS offering.  Today Robi is already the market leader when it comes to services in entertainment and social media.  3. Provision of critical infrastructure. As wage rates increase in the country, improvements in working productivity through investments in critical infrastructure become an even more critical issue in Bangladesh. 4. Employment and employee development. Current Project will create additional direct and indirect high skilled employment in Bangladesh. 5. Catalytic role. IFC will play a catalytic role in local private sector development by attracting foreign investors into Bangladesh. 6. Government Revenues.  Telecom operators are one of the highest tax paying entities in the country - on average 55% of revenues are used to pay taxes and regulatory fees.","","","1. Provide long-term financing: other than ECA loans, significant long-term financing is not available in Bangladesh.  Although Robi''s expected cash generation is strong, there will be financing needs to complete its Capex program.

Regulatory risk is a key issue in the Bangladeshi telecom sector, as the regulatory environment is still evolving and presents uncertainty.

(Finansbank or the Bank) is the 5th largest private bank in Turkey and one of the fastest growing private banks in the country with a comprehensive network of branches, and a market share of 4.2% based on net loans as of December 2014. The bank is owned 99.8% by the National Bank of Greece (NBG) group. The balance is listed on the stock exchange. The proposed Project is for IFC to make a second round of investment of up to US$100 million in Finansbanks new notes issuances of up to US$280 million from its existing Diversified Payments Rights (DPR) securitization facility. IFCs proposed investment is targeted at increasing lending to MSMEs in Turkey, consistent with IFCs strategic priorities for the country. Although the MSMEs represent almost 80% of total employment in Turkey, loans made to MSMEs represent only about 38% of the total loans. Access to finance is perceived as the single most severe obstacle to growth by MSMEs, according to the 2008 enterprise survey conducted by the World Bank. The proposed Project would deepen IFCs relationship with Finansbank and help expand its footprint in financing MSMEs by supporting the development of its product and service offerings tailored to the specific needs of this underserved segment.","","","","","","1) Financial Inclusion of Underserved Segments: Turkey has an unbanked population of 23 million which represents 0.9% ofthe world''s unbanked population.

Through its subsidiary, Toni, the leading dairy company in Ecuador, Toni Corp processes milk purchased from more than 3,500 farmers into a wide range of dairy products (UHT milk, flavored milk, cream, butter, cheese and yogurt.) Toni Corp also owns Topsi, an ice-cream manufacturing operation; PESA, a packaging plant that supplies the dairy business and sells to 3rd parties; and Dipor SA (Dipor), the company in charge of the distribution all of Tonis products, and Cosedone, the fleet vehicle transportation company.With a production capacity of more than 300,000 liters of milk/day, Toni currently operates a plant located in an industrial area of Guayaquil. This plant, originally designed in the early 1970s to produce 7,000 metric tons of yogurt, is currently producing more than 30,000 metric tons. Although the Group has managed to grow its capacity over time to keep up with increasing demand, the plant has reached a saturation point.  Topsi, which is located in Guayaquil and has a current production capacity of 530,000kg/month, is also in need of a capacity increase.Toni has 20 distribution centers, 4 milk collections centers (centros de acopio), a national distributions system that reaches out to 110,000 sale points around the country and its own vehicle fleet for distribution of products.In September 2011, IFC approved a US$30m senior loan investment in Tonicorp for the expansion of its production facilities in Guayaquil, Ecuador. IFCs investment allowed Tonicorp increase its production capacity, generating efficiencies through better layout, newer equipment and improving E&S management.  As part of this project, IFC and Tonicorp agreed on an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) that included  the development and implementation of an employee  grievance mechanism; improving the occupational health and safety (OHS) conditions at Tonis operations (i.e.,  fall prevention measures at milk unload area, install emergency showers close to acid and soda storage areas, enhance secondary contention, etc.); and conducting an EHS due diligence at its milk collecting centers to identify OHS risks, identify effluents treatment, and hazardous material storage measures, among others. To address the need for further increase in production capacity, along with generating efficiencies through better layouts and newer and more resource-efficient equipment, Toni Corp decided to build an integrated plant, the Aurora Plant, incorporating the milk (Toni) and ice cream (Topsi) manufacturing operations which  currently operate in separate locations.  Besides addressing the lack of storage capacity, infrastructure deficiencies, logistics challenges, and lack of internal adequate spaces, the proposed project will also bring equipment upgrades which will improve product quality, optimize resources consumption, (i.e., energy, water, vapor, etc.),  and improve workplace conditions.  As part of this project, the company will also enhance the environmental, health, and safety (EHS) conditions of the distribution centers and of the milk collections centers.Currently, Toni buys a total of 180,000 lt/d of milk; with the new proposed project, it anticipates buying 400,000 lt/d of milk.  The dairy production capacity will increase approximately 10% from 1,017 MM to 1,124 MM and the ice-cram production will increase approximately 58% from 159 MM to 252.7 MM.  It is anticipated that the ice-cream operation will begin in December 2015 and the entire plant will begin operating by May 2016.The Aurora plant will be located in an approximately 179,000 m2 area, 14 km to the North of Guayaquil, at approximately 10 km from the existing dairy production facility, in the Parroquia Urbana Pascuales, in front of the Daule River. On the east side of the land and adjacent to the project site, there is a 200 house community and on the west side, separated by a channel and at approximately 250m distant, there is a new housing development. Once the new plant is completed, both Toni, the current dairy, and Topsi, the current ice-cream manufacturing plants will be dismantled and the land returned to its owners.

The SPV will purchase a portfolio of non-performing loans (NPLs) issued by the Romanian subsidiary of a large regional bank. The NPLs consist of small and medium enterprise (SME), small business, and retail. Through the proposed project, IFC would play an important role in (i) providing an attractive mechanism for NPL resolution in the region; (ii) assisting with balance sheet management of the selling bank, increasing liquidity; (iii) mobilize funding from the private sector.","","","","","","(i)  Economic Development: The successful implementation of the project would improve the secondary market for distressed assets in the countries of investment and could catalyze investment interest on the part of other investors.  A developed secondary market in NPL trading and servicing is a stabilizing factor in financials systems.  This allows the financial institutions selling DAs to reallocate capital to other activities, hopefully, new lending.  (ii) Business Environment: As banks in the region increase the sale of their distressed assets to independent private investors, the transparency of those institutions'' balance sheets should improve as the assets sold would be priced according to market conditions. (iii)  Financial Infrastructure: IFC''s involvement in this project would positively impact the market place by building NPL servicing capacity in the financial markets. The project is expected to increase the ability of financial intermediaries in the country to offload their assets, particularly non-performing ones, improve liquidity and devote  resources to originating new transactions","","","(i) Market Support: Through this project, IFC would support the strengthening of the local financial system by working with a systemically important bank to sell NPLs through (a) the identification of co-investors who have regional risk as well as NPL asset appetite and (b) by working with the bank and co-investors to structure a transaction that works for all. <br>(ii) Knowledge Transfer: The transaction would transfer best practices for DA collection and resolution, corporate governance and environmental and social management. This is especially important in ECA markets, many of which are experiencing their first financial crisis of significance following the break-up of the former Soviet Union and their first experience with large DA sales.<br>(iii) Liquidity: The Project would provide liquidity for DA investments, important as liquidity is still scarce for such investments in the Balkans at reasonable rates of return. IFC would, therefore, play a counter-cyclical role by supporting reputable investors with experience in DA internationally as well as growing experience regionally. IFC''s participation in the Project should encourage other private sector players to consider DA investments in the region.<br>(iv) Local Knowledge: IFC is active in the region and has relationships with local banks as well as regulators. IFC would support the Project through its local contacts and knowledge of local policies and procedures.<br>(v) Transparency: IFC''s presence should provide comfort as to the transparency of asset pricing in markets where regulators are sensitive to distressed asset sales prices.","","","Much of the success of IFCs DARP investments lies in IFCs chosen partner-servicer.  For this project, IFC is partnering with Kruk Romania SRLa leading distressed debt investor and servicer with 8 years of operating history in Romania and more than 500 employees. It has experience in consumer, mortgage, corporate NPLs investment and servicing as well as debt collection outsourced by banks/creditors. Part of its competitive advantage lies in its innovative pro-settlement strategy towards debtors, or clients.  In addition, it has significant experience in debt portfolio valuation (over 2000 portfolios assessed at Group level), purchase and management not only in Romania but also in Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia.

Mainstream is an international renewable energy firm specialized in the development, financing, construction and operation of large-scale wind and solar power plants and has assets in operation and under construction in Africa, Europe, North America and South America. Actis is a leading private equity investor in emerging markets. The proposed project is an equity investment of up to $40 m in Mainstream Renewable Power Africa Holdings Limited (the Company), which has been established with the sole purpose of holding Mainstreams interest in Lekela. Mainstreams pipeline will act as a feeder to Lekela, with each project being transferred to the platform at a late development stage. Lekela will also bid on some projects directly, with Mainstream providing development services. Mainstream will develop projects and manage construction and operations under service agreements with Lekela. Funds are expected to be utilized for equity financing of project-financed renewable energy assets across Africa. The current Lekela pipeline in Africa includes three wind projects under construction by Mainstream in South Africa and a number of wind and solar projects under development in South Africa, Ghana and Egypt. Additional early stage projects have been identified elsewhere in Africa.The three most advanced Lekela projects in South Africa were initially awarded to a Mainstream-led consortium as a result of Round 3 of the countrys Renewable Energy IPP Procurement Process (REIPPPP) and transferred to Lekela in February 2015. Noupoort Wind Power Plant (WPP) is an 80 MW project located 10 km east of the town of Noupoort in the Northern Cape Province. Construction commenced in February 2015 and the planned commercial operations date is July 2016. Khobab and Loeriesfontein II WPPs will have a capacity of 140 MW each and will be sited on adjacent farms 60 km north of the town of Loeriesfontein in the Northern Cape. Construction of these two WPPs commenced in mid-2015 and commercial operations is expected in December 2017. Mainstream has also been awarded preferred bidder status on two REIPPPP Round 4 WPPs: the 140 MW Kangnas project located in the Northern Cape and the 110 MW Perdekraal East WPP in the Western Cape Province.

(KPCL or the Company), a special-purpose vehicle incorporated in Pakistan and majority owned by China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited (CSAIL), is undertaking the construction, operation and maintenance of a 720MW hydropower plant being developed on the Jhelum River (the project). The project is expected to generate 3,174 GWh (net) annually and will sell all of its energy to the National Transmission and Dispatch Company Limited (NTDC) under a 30-year Power Purchase Agreement. Payment obligations of NTDC will be guaranteed by the Government of Pakistan (GoP). The project construction is expected to commence in December 2015, and is expected to take five years to complete. The construction will include a 95.5 meter high asphalt concrete core rockfill dam, a surface powerhouse, four headrace tunnels (7.9-9.6m in diameter x 316m long), a spillway, and a 5km 500kV transmission interconnection to the 500 kV Neelum Jhelum line (being developed by NTDC), which will connect to the national power grid. This new interconnection line will also be designed and constructed by NTDC.  At present, the route and connection point to the national grid have not been determined. The project construction will include three diversion tunnels (12.5m diameter x 447 m long) and cofferdams upstream and downstream of the main dam as well as a central construction camp and satellite camps for staging activities and for accommodating workers.  In addition, a total of 9.6km of public roads, two vehicle bridges and a footbridge over the Jhelum, and several bridges over small tributaries will be replaced and moved out of the footprints of the construction site and reservoir.The project will operate as a run-of-river project for approximately six months per year, in spring and summer, and as a daily peaking project for the remainder of the year. In summer, water not used for generation will be diverted through the spillway and discharged to the river downstream of the tailrace. The dam will create a reservoir that will reach 27km upstream in the steep Jhelum gorge.  The reservoir will average no more than about 200m across in the narrow gorge and cover an area of about 696 hectares.

IFC also reviewed underlying studies for the international ESIA, including a Dam Break Analysis, Critical Habitat Assessment, Cumulative Impact Assessment, Biodiversity Baseline Study, Stakeholder Engagement Plan, and Resettlement Action Plan.Karot is the most advanced of the three, hydropower projects on the Jhelum River that CSAIL is planning. As part of the equity investment described above, IFC assisted CSAIL in developing a corporate Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) for managing the risks inherent in large energy sector projects, particularly in the hydropower sector. Also as part of the equity investment, IFC has provided further assistance to CSAIL in building E&S management capacity in KPCL.  As part of the CSAIL supervision and Karot appraisal process between mid-2014 and June 2015, IFC representatives have participated in multiple meetings, presentations, and conference calls with CSAIL and KPCL managers, their respective environmental, social and health and safety (ESHS) staff, relevant government officials, and people in the villages that will be most affected by Karot HPP development.

Given the importance of this segment, the Bank has implemented a stricter risk management approach, including continuous monitoring and higher collateral requirements, regardless of the size of sub-clients.","","The key risks and impacts derive from Itaú Paraguay's capacity to enhance its ESMS in order to identify and manage the potential environmental and social risks associated to sub-projects, especially its agribusiness portfolio that presently accounts for 42% of assets. Additionally E&S risks and impacts of the Project derive from the institution's capacity to maintain good practices with regards to labor and working conditions. The Bank's premises present good LFS procedures with trained staff and fire prevention and combat systems following applicable HC laws.","",Task Title & DescriptionAnticipated Completion Date Upgrade Applicable requirements04/11/2016Staff Training04/11/2016Implementation Plan of ESMS Enhancements 10/15/2015,37098,"",O-AA - Commercial Banking - General,"",60.0 ,"",""

It is anticipated that the survey will take approximately nine months to complete. As part of the activities a camp has been established with an area of approximately 200m x 200m and will comprise of a fence yard, basic offices and accommodation. It is expected that during the peak of the activities there will be about 300 employees out of which approximately 50% may be labor from the local communities. An ESIA was completed in 2013 for the 2D seismic activities and was prepared in following Performance Standards by a combination of an international (leading) and local consultant. Based on the identification of risks an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been prepared to mitigate the impacts.Kenya  Block 9 is defined as arid and semi-arid land with sparse vegetation and a number of seasonally dry riverbeds. The 2D seismic area falls within the counties of Wajir, Isolo and Marsabit. The Company conducted approximately 1,486 kms of survey and drilled three exploration wells, which did not provide the expected results. The sites have since been recovered and rehabilitated. Some of the infrastructure such as the air strip and improved roads at Bahasi was handed over to the local authorities to use for emergency use and as access by communities. The camps were also demobilized. Sala 1 well site has been rehabilitated as well and is currently in the process of been handed over to the community along with some of the improved roads. There is also a Management of Change approved by the authorities relating to the variation of the ESIA which indicates that the Company needs to demobilize any infrastructure put in place for the activities. The Sala 2 well site is also in the process of being handed over to the community, some of the tracts have been left in place at the request of the community, although authorization has also been granted by the local authorities.Non-Operated AssetsThe non-operated assets would include 10BA, 10A, 13T, 12A and 10BB in the region of Turkana and Baringo in Kenya, and the South Omo in Ethiopia. Together these assets account for approximately 100,000 square kms of total area of exploration. The operator, Tullow Oil is in the process of studying different oil production development options for the entire area and has commissioned a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) to provide support in the decision making process. The SEA will consider sustainability issues in project policies, plans and programs at the earliest stages of development to inform decisions on the most appropriate site-specific locations of the facilities and infrastructure required, which then will be assessed with an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment.For all the seismic and drilling exploration activities, the operator has prepared a site-specific ESIA with appropriate Environmental Management Plans in accordance with the 2012 IFC Performance Standards and Good International Industry Practices. In the South Lokichar Basin, there have been 22 wells drilled with 16 successes, demobilization of camps and rehabilitation of well pads have occurred in some of the project sites according to specified procedures. The first well in block 12 A will be drilled during 2015. Site acquisition and compensation has been completed and stakeholder engagement has been extensive.The South Omo block is located in the south-west of Ethiopia within the Southern Rift Basin of East Africa Basin. The block falls within the SNNP and covers a surface area of 29,465 square kms. This block is characterized for having sensitivities with respect to biodiversity including a (i) National Park; (ii) UNESCO World Heritage Site; (iii) Murule controlled hunting area; (iv) Omo Delta Wetland; and (iv) Chelbi wildlife reserve area (Grevys Zebra). To date the operator has not conducted any seismic or exploration drilling activities within these areas and has specific policies regarding any work in sensitive areas. There were four wells drilled in the South Omo block and all have been completed and rehabilitated to original conditions, with the exception of some of the infrastructure such a bridge located at the Weito River. Tullow conducted the appropriate assessment and consultation, and obtained the appropriate approval by the authorities. ESIAs were conducted for all the seismic and drilling operations with appropriate environmental management plans. Associated FacilitiesAs part of construction and production activities the following will be considered as Associated Facilities to the project including the (i) Upstream development: well pads in different fields in the South Lockichar basin, flow lines, central processing facility(CPF) and support facilities, (ii) Midstream development: consisting of an export pipeline component from the CPF in the South Lokichar Basin to a marine export terminal, and (iii) Downstream development: comprising an onshore terminal, connecting onshore pipeline to the coastline, and an offshore pipeline section that connects to a single point mooring. Additionally, draft scoping activities to identify the risks associated with each component have been prepared and these will be reviewed in conjunction with other studies including alternative analyses to determine the appropriate site locations. It is important to note that additional upstream and midstream entities operators likely will be involved in the development of these activities.","","","","The scope of IFCs review on the environmental and social (E&S) aspects of the project included a pre-appraisal site visit to Kenya assets in January, 2015 and a full appraisal to Kenya and Ethiopia to operated and non-operated assets in April, 2015. During this site visit the team held meetings with communities, meetings with local officials, meetings with Africa Oil and Tullows personnel. Additionally, the team reviewed Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs), Africa Oil and Tullows Environmental and Social Policies, stakeholder management plans, and specialized studies.","","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category A project due to the likelihood that potentially significant and diverse impacts could be associated with the exploration and development activities of the project. IFCs due diligence indicates that the investment will have impacts that must be managed in a manner consistent with the Performance Standards.In general, the assessment of the project has been performed based on the current activities which include seismic and exploration work. However, there has also been due consideration of risks inherent in the oil & gas sector and in the context of the projects geographic setting. The Company is committed to review their Environmental and Social Management system to incorporate plans and procedures meeting the intent of the IFC Performance Standards as the project progresses towards construction and production..","","","","",36699,"",B-AA - Oil and Gas Exploration,"","","",""

LTD.,"Gbl Ind, Manufact, Agribus & Services",2015-09-02T04:00:00Z,"",A,Other,"The project consists of providing senior debt to Indorama Kokand Textile ('IKT' or 'the company') to finance the expansion of its cotton yarn plant located in the city of Kokand, Fergana Oblast, Uzbekistan, which will allow the company to respond to increasing demand for high quality cotton yarn and further strengthen its competitive position. Activities to be financed by IFC involve construction of Phase 4 of the facility which includes development of a new spinning facility adjacent to the existing Phases 1, 2 and 3 on the existing land plot, which was originally allocated to IKT by the Government of Uzbekistan (GoU). Upon completion of the expansion, IKT's capacity will increase by 44,000 equivalent spindles of compact cotton yarn from the current capacity of 110,000 equivalent spindles, This will increase annual cotton consumption capacity by IKT to 50,000 metric tons (MT) (from 35,000 MT). This additional cotton will be sourced from existing suppliers and will not involve the expansion of cotton growing areas. IKT's annual output of final product (yarn) will therefore increase to 38,000 MT (from 26,000 MT). The expansion was agreed with GoU in May 2015 and site preparation commenced in June 2015. Commissioning of the new phase is expected in the second half of 2016. A reputable national construction company, who built the previous two out of the three phases of the project and demonstrated successful performance, conducts construction of Phase 4 of the project.IKT's spun yarn process involves the production of high quality open end and compact yarn by processing cotton fiber which includes mechanical cleaning and sorting, carding (to disentangle and clean the cotton fibers), combing (only for compact yarn), spinning, finishing and packing of the yarn. No washing, rinsing, bleaching, dyeing, mercerizing, or other specific chemical treatment is used in the process and, therefore, no hazardous chemicals or water is used or produced as a result of production.IKT was incorporated by Indorama Group in 2010 as a part of their strategy to establish a presence in Central Asia and further expand the global spinning business. The factory, which was built on a brownfield site, is currently equipped with state-of-the-art spinning machinery imported mainly from Europe and Japan. The plant also has a robust monitoring system and new state of art laboratory for quality assurance purposes. IKT exports over 90% of its product to global markets, while the balance is consumed by domestic market. Primary markets include Asia, Latin America, Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).PT. Indo-Rama Synthetics Tbk, which is listed on the Jakarta Stock Exchange and headquartered in Jakarta, Indonesia, is one of Indonesia's largest producers of polyester products (280,000 tons per annum of filament yarns, pet resin, staple fiber & chips) and spun yarns (68,000 tons per annum). PT. Indo-Rama Synthetics Tbk exports its polyester products, spun yarn and fabrics to customers in over 70 countries in North America, Europe, South America, Asia, Australia, Africa and the Middle East. Indorama Group was established in 1976 and employs (in its subsidiaries and associates) over 26,000 people globally. It is currently one of the leading emerging global industrial conglomerates with growth driven largely through acquisitions and green/brown field projects including establishing joint ventures in emerging markets. Indorama Group operates spun yarn facilities in Indonesia, Turkey, Sri Lanka and Uzbekistan with a total manufacturing capacity of over 110,000 tons per annum.IFC and the Indorama Group have an existing business relationship that began in the early 1990's whereby IFC supported the Indorama Group in a number of new ventures. To date there have been 7 investments though 6 of these are now closed; the one ongoing investment involves the support to Indorama for development of greenfield fertilizer plant in Nigeria. IFC's experience with Indorama in respect of environmental and social performance has been satisfactory and the operation in Nigeria currently has a rating of 'excellent'.","","","","IFC's review of the project consisted of reviewing technical information provided by IKT, interviews with IKT's management and technical specialists and a site visit. IFC Environmental and Social Specialists visited the company's facilities and local communities in August 2015 and convened discussions with the management and technical staff of IKT, including the Managing Director, General Manager, and those responsible for production, environment management, occupational health and safety, fire protection and emergency response, training and human resources. In addition, IFC met with representatives of IKT's trade union and local stakeholders including mahallas (community organizations) and Administration of the City of Kokand, as well as government agencies responsible for economic and social development of the city, private enterprise development, educational and health institutions. One of the primary risks associated with the project is related to the potential presence of child and forced labor in the cotton supply chain in Uzbekistan.  Thus, this area was a key focus of IFC's due diligence and risk assessment to gain an informed understanding of the issue.  In doing so IFC conducted a series of meetings with a range of stakeholders involved in the current GoU initiatives to reduce and eliminate such practices in the cotton-growing sector. IFC met and discussed the issue with the members of the GoU's Coordinating Council on Child and Forced Labor comprising of the Minister of Labor and Social Protection, the Head of the Federation of Trade Unions and the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. IFC also engaged with representatives of the government agencies and companies working in the cotton sector such as Uzinterimpex and Uzbekyengilsanoat, and the United States Embassy and European Union (EU) Delegation to Uzbekistan who are actively involved in countrywide activities on the issue. IFC also visited local representatives of IKT's cotton supply chain in Kokand and convened interviews with cotton producing farmers, management and technical staff of a local cotton gin and cotton terminal supplying raw cotton fiber to IKT.IFC also participated in discussions with local and international organizations during the Cotton Roundtable held in Tashkent on August 5-6, 2015, which was organized jointly by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and GoU. This was attended by multiple stakeholders including the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) and a number of Uzbekistan government agencies involved in the government-led process of reforming labor practices in the cotton sector. Further, IFC has had ongoing engagement with the World Bank which is currently facilitating independent third party monitoring (TPM) and the feedback mechanism (FBM) of cotton production in Uzbekistan by ILO as part of the World Bank program in the country.During the discussions with multiple stakeholders, IFC noted significant progress achieved over the last few years in the elimination of child labor from the cotton sector in Uzbekistan by collaboration between GoU and ILO. Similarly, IFC noted the success of the ongoing process by GoU, ILO, World Bank and international donors in facilitating the elimination of forced labor from the sector by ongoing TPM and the FBM as implemented by ILO and GoU. While recognizing the inherent risks related to the use of child and forced labor in the cotton sector, IFC, by way of making this investment, is aiming to support the broader initiatives as described above to fully eliminate such practices. Specific actions, which are to be implemented by IKT, are defined in the Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) for this project.","","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category A project due to potential social risks related to supply chain, namely labor practices in the cotton production sector in Uzbekistan. While the company has limited leverage to influence its supply chain and the country-wide and sector-wide employment practices in cotton harvesting, IKT still retains significant reputational and business risks due to their direct association with the country's cotton supply chain. However, via implementation of the actions as defined in the ESAP, the company will limit the potential for these risks to be associated with its activities and equally support the elimination of such risks in the cotton production sector of Uzbekistan. Supply chain risks aside, direct environmental and social impacts from the project, which involves expansion of an existing cotton spinning facility within the existing footprint of the facility, are not significant, largely reversible and can be addressed through established mitigation measures. Key issues related to this component of the project are labor and working conditions, occupational health and safety during construction and workplace health and safety during operations (including preventing pollution by cotton dust), solid and liquid waste management and stakeholder engagement. These issues will be addressed via the company's existing environmental health and social management system, which will be enhanced as defined in the ESAP.","","","","",36098,"","K-AA - Spinning (Yarn, Including Integrated with Fiber Production)","","","",""

The Project has been classified as Category FI-2 according to the IFC's Environmental and Social Review Procedure. The Fund's portfolio involves transactions that carry potential environmental and social (E&S) risks, such as impacts on biodiversity, resettlement and child labor and forced labor associated with commodity supply chains. For this project, the Fund will need to ensure that all investments are in compliance with: (i) the IFC Exclusion List; (ii) the E&S laws and regulations of the countries where they operate; (iii) and some instances the IFC performance standards.","","

The main E&S risks associated with this project are related to BAF's capacity to implement the necessary Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) to effectively manage the E&S risk of its portfolio. BAF's portfolio fluctuates over the course of a year and at end of May 2015 includes 40% exposure to soybean-related commodities. In general the Fund's portfolio is vulnerable to E&S risks associated with agribusiness. These may include, but are not limited to child, forced and bonded labor, Occupational Health and Safety Risks to Workers and surrounding communities, as well as habitat conversion and agricultural pollution.

These will be managed and/or mitigated by implementing a formal ESMS to the satisfaction of the IFC that will effectively identify and monitor the E&S risks. This will require of BAF to develop sufficient tools to carry out country/product E&S risk assessments to ensure that all transactions are in compliance with the E&S requirements and provide subsequent monitoring. In some cases the IFC Performance Standards may apply and it may be necessary to have a qualified third party consultant conduct the E&S assessment, especially in cases of repeat clients with large exposures and in cases of high country/product risk. Certain additional restrictions may apply in E&S sensitive regions, such as the Chaco in Paraguay and Argentina and the Amazon in Brazil. In addition, as part of this project the Fund will also; (i) Identify responsible, qualified staff to manage and implement the ESMS; (ii) ensure that the Fund's portfolio is screened against the IFC Exclusion List and national E&S laws, (iii) prohibit the fund from holding loans that would be classified as Category A Projects, (iv) Demonstrate commitment to applying the labor standards and working conditions established by PS2; (v) Submit examples of ESMS implementation (screening tools, product/country matrix etc.); (vi) Submit a periodic report to IFC in a format to be provided by IFC","",Task Title & DescriptionAnticipated Completion Date Nominate officersEstablish SEMSFormalize proceduresDevelop guidelinesStaff TrainingEnhance HR policies,36856,"",O-FA - Other Non-Banking Financial Institution (NBFI),"",70.0 ,"",""

The total project cost is estimated at $85.6M; IFCs investment is an A Loan of up to $12.5M and Global Agriculture Food Security Program (GAFSP) Loan of up to $12.5M. KTDA is one of the largest private tea management agencies in East Africa. KTDA is owned by 54 individual tea companies that operate 65 tea processing factories across Kenya. Each tea company is owned by a number of smallholder tea farmers; there are approximately 562,000 smallholders supplying tea leaves to the KTDA companies. KTDA Power was established in 2010 as part of KTDAs strategy to reduce energy costs at the factories.  KTDA Power is developing a portfolio of small, run-of-the-river SHPs with an aggregate generation capacity of up to 29MW across 10 sites in various locations in Kenya.  Three out of these 10 sites are fully funded; the remaining seven sites will be covered by IFCs financing. Each SHP will be owned by newly created asset holding companies, Regional Power Companies (RPCs). In turn, each RPC is jointly owned by several KTDA Tea Factories located in the region where the relevant SHP is constructed.

The project will be developed by a consortium of Sembcorp Utilities Pte Ltd ('Sembcorp Utilities' or 'sponsor') and MMID Utilities Pte Ltd ('MMID') under a special purpose vehicle ('Company').The 225MW CCGT will include two sets of Gas Turbine (GT) units; two sets of Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG); one steam turbine generating unit with associated auxiliary equipment; a switchyard area; cooling Water System; demineralized Water System; and wastewater treatment facility.  The gas supply pipeline will connect the power plant to an existing gas receiving station located approximately 1.6 km away. A 230kV overhead transmission line, approximately 3 km in length, will connect the power plant to an upgraded Myingyan Steel Mill sub-station located within an existing adjacent steel mill complex. The power plant will be operated with a closed-loop water cooling system.  A water supply pipeline will connect the power plant to the water intake point and new pumping station at the Ayeyarwady River about 12 km away and will be buried underground. A wastewater discharge pipeline will connect the power plant to an existing irrigation canal located approximately 2.5 km away. The water supply and wastewater pipelines will be run in parallel for 2.5 km until reaching the irrigation canal.  The water supply pipeline will be built alongside and within the right of way of the irrigation canal all the way to the Ayeyarwady River. The project will also require the reinforcement and commissioning of a jetty located at Nyanung Hla, about 28 km from the project site. Construction is expected to start in the first quarter of 2016 and be completed in approximately 22 months with commercial operation targeted for the first quarter of 2018. Construction activities of the project will include: mobilization, site clearance, onshore construction of all project components, Nyaung Hla jetty reinforcement and commissioning. Heavy equipment such as bulldozers, excavators, dump trucks, compactors, etc. will be used at the project site.  The EPC contractor will be appointed to undertake the engineering, procurement and construction activities of the project. The EPC contractor will be responsible for implementation of the mitigation, management measures and monitoring program under the sponsor's supervision.  The Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of the project will be undertaken by the sponsor with the support of a long term service agreement (LTSA) for the GT with the manufacturer. The LTSA will cover the supply of spare parts, supervision and specialized labor for inspections, major and minor overhauls.  Core project facilities (i.e. power plant) will together occupy a footprint of about 11.6 hectares. The power plant site is situated within a larger 280 ha Government owned and operated steel mill site (which houses the Myingyan Steel Mill 4) and is located towards the northeastern corner of the site.Based on findings of the project's scoping report and from IFC's village visits, the 280 ha site was acquired for the purpose of establishing the steel mill by the Ministry of Industry (MoI) between the years 1998-2000. Officially this economically displaced about 130 villagers from the Sa Khar, Hnan Hwa, and Hpet Taw villages, in a Government-led land acquisition process that involved up to 90 persons from Sa Khar; 40 from Hnan Hwa; and a smaller but unconfirmed number from Hpet Taw. The process did not involve any physical resettlement. It is unclear how many of those persons, if any, owned/used the 11.6 ha power plant plot that has subsequently been identified within the larger 280 ha site. The site was fenced after the year 2000 although during recent site visits in 2015 it was observed that gates and fences were open in some places allowing villagers to use the site for informal fire wood collection and cattle grazing.   Based on information available, compensation was not made during 1998-2000. One time cash compensation of 200,000 - 283,000 Kyat / ha (depending on land productivity) was paid 15 years later in 2013 by the Government to these 130 persons who had title to the affected land. It appears that the amounts paid did not cover replacement value, as at least some of the affected persons reportedly sold off assets or took on debt to come up with funds to buy replacement land of comparable size/location/productivity. Besides the above-mentioned 130 persons, an unknown number of other users of the 280 ha site did not possess titles and were not compensated. Some of the affected persons (including land rights holders and others not identified) lost all of their landholding in 2000, while others retained varying percentages of their original total landholding. Some of them who had reportedly incurred debt since 2000 used the compensation they received in 2013 to pay off part of the debt. As this legacy land acquisition was undertaken 15 years ago by a Government entity, was focused on a much larger site and was not related to the establishment of the proposed power plant (i.e. not undertaken in anticipation of the IFC financed project), PS5 is not deemed to be applicable to the legacy resettlement (but is applicable to Right-of-Way land acquisition for the water supply line and overhead transmission line  refer to PS5 section). Nonetheless, the Company seeks to promote local development and license to operate in the project area and is thus committed to working with historically affected communities to improve their livelihoods and facilitate access to project-related employment opportunities for them where possible (prioritizing historically affected households to the extent feasible). Refer to the community engagement section for details.","","","","IFC's review of this project consisted of appraising technical, environmental, and social information made available by the sponsor including: Environmental and Social Impact Assessment ('ESIA') as well as Environment, Health, and Safety ('EHS') management plans of the project; project EHS Plan; sponsor's EHS Policy Statement and Corporate Management Plans and Procedures; EPC contract; and sponsor's Human Resource ('HR') policies.The appraisal team also interviewed the sponsor's corporate management and business level management team including: function heads for environment, health and safety, human resources, corporate social responsibility, and external affairs and security. Further, the appraisal included site visits to the project site and meetings with community members from Sa Khar, Hnan Ywa, Hpet Taw and Nyaung Kan.IFC's appraisal considered environmental and social management plans for the project and gaps if any between these plans and IFC requirements.

It is headquartered in Kabul. As of December 2014, the Bank had 33 branches, 2 cash outlets, 59 Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), and 136 Point of Sale (POS) devices, across 10 provinces in Afghanistan. AIBs banking services include corporate/commercial, small business and retail banking, as well as electronic and Islamic banking. With total assets of US$964.2 million, AIB has the largest market share in the Afghan banking sector of approximately 23%.The proposed project entails IFC taking an equity stake of up to 15% in AIB in two tranches. The initial tranche is for an equity stake of 7.5%, purchased equally from AIBs two main sponsor shareholders. The second tranche comprises of an IFC option to increase its equity stake by an additional 7.5% within two years of its initial investment in AIB by subscribing to new shares issued by AIB (fresh capital injection).The proposed IFC investment together with the proposed IFC advisory services will help to further institutionalize AIBs shareholding, strengthen the Bank in operational risk management and build its capacity for commercial lending in diversified sectors. IFCs goal is to help the Bank, and by example the banking sector, improve financial inclusion in this Frontier and Conflict-affected State (FCS), where the per capita income of US$690 in 2014, was the lowest in Asia and among the 20 lowest in the World.

Potential areas of technical assistance may for example include operational risk management, IT audit, operations re-engineering, retail banking, commercial lending, corporate governance, digital finance, and in the development of Afghan 'high flyer' staff to assume senior executive positions.","","","1) Access to Finance, Job creation and Private Sector Development: The project will help in giving businesses greater access to finance, thus contributing to job creation and private sector development. Afghanistan has faced chronic unemployment and a burgeoning young population implies an estimated 400,000 new entrants into the job market. 2) Strengthen the Banking Sector: IFC's proposed equity and potential advisory package will provide support to AIB, strengthening the overall banking sector and improving competition by enhancing best practices. 3) Build Confidence in Afghanistan's Financial Sector: IFC's engagement with AIB at a time when Afghanistan and many other countries in the MENA region, are faced with economic, security and political challenges will send a positive signal to the market and enforce IFC's countercyclical role. This will support the Government of Afghanistan in its reform agenda.","","","IFC's proposed investment would allow AIB to benefit from IFC's major regional and global experience including in other FCS markets, through a potentially integrated capacity building advisory program, covering for example operational risk management and enhancing commercial lending capability. This will support both the Bank and the country by prudently increasing its loan portfolio thus enhancing financial inclusion in the country. IFC will also be able to offer independent advice through a nominee director on AIB's board.

Citla represents a unique opportunity for IFC to take on an early mover role and providing strategic financing for long-term investments that are critically needed in the sector.","","","","","","The Project will help promote the development of the oil and gas sector in Mexico in a critical moment for the success of the reforms and will support the Government of Mexico''s target to increase oil production to 3.5mmboe/d by 2025 from 2.4mmboe/d in 2014. The project supports the development of local companies in areas that are of lesser importance to large oil companies to maximize development of the country''s resources and to develop local expertise. By opening up new hydrocarbon discoveries in the region, the project will hopefully provide a platform which paves the way for a broader participation of local companies, thereby triggering economic stimulus for the country.

As a result of the satellites proximity to earth, O3bs network is able to provide low cost, low latency, and high quality broadband connectivity to all several customers located worldwide between 45 degrees latitude North and South, covering most emerging markets. The current Project consists of financing the construction of O3bs eight additional satellites (Satellites 13-16 and 17-20) and the launch costs of Satellites 13-16, to provide additional capacity to meet expected demand. This will bring the constellation ultimately to 16 operational spacecraft.","","","","",N/A  Social Risks,INCREASED AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO COMMUNICATIONS AND DATA/INTERNET SERVICES:  O3b can provide access to land-locked countries and to island countries where submarine cable is unfeasible.  DEMONSTRATION EFFECT: The success of O3b will demonstrate there are demands for alternatives to traditional fiber and high cost GEO satellites.,"","","LONG TERM FINANCING: Long-term financing is required for a satellite operation, which is characterized by high upfront costs prior to launch and high, stable cash flow thereafter. <br>STRENGTHENING PARTNERSHIP WITH EXISTING CLIENT: O3b is a current client of IFC. IFC and its exiting lenders helped the Company restructure its debt when it faced financial difficulties. The Company has again invited IFC to be part of this new financing round and play a leading role in arranging the new Senior Debt facility from the group of DFIs. This is evidence of the strong value and appreciation that the Company places on IFC''s involvement and value-add.","","","O3b Networks Ltd. is a private company founded in 2008 and is incorporated in Jersey, the Channel Islands.

At appraisal for the proposed new investment by IFC, it was determined that O3bs key E&S risk remains in the siting and development of teleport sites, as it was at appraisal for IFCs first investment in O3b.  However, in IFCs first investment in O3b, it was considered possible that new teleport sites would be developed by O3b  whereas in O3bs new project, O3B plans only to lease space for O3bs teleport equipment at existing antenna farms.  As a result, E&S risk is expected to be reduced in this project, and it is classified as Category C.

It has already started operations in 1 Tier-2 city in the last 2 months, and intends to keep growing its footprint. The Project will help (a) increase the availability and quality of grocery products; (b) generate employment, build capacity and improve skill sets in this sector; (c) help develop supply chains and logistics infrastructure including agricultural logistics which are an integral part of developing efficient cities. The Project will achieve this by leveraging Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to manage logistics, and effectively connect farmers and other food and grocery providers to retailers for onward sales to end-consumers; and (d) support the development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the supply-chain. The Project is also aligned with IFCs regional strategy as it provides strong linkages to the local economy and will promote inclusiveness through direct job creation in urban and semi-urban areas and by developing local supply chains.SGSPLs model is focused on improvements in the supply chains for groceries through the following activities: (i) Procuring fresh fruits and vegetables directly from farmers through its network of collection centers: the Company already has 4 operating collection centers and intends to grow this network to more than 15 centers across the country.(ii) Setting up best-in-class backend infrastructure: The Company uses technology (such as wireless handheld devices, automated and integrated inventory and warehouse management software), in addition to using optimized warehouse layouts, route and traffic planning, and cold storage and transportation systems to setup its backend infrastructure. This results in higher utilizations, lower inventory levels and lower wastage of raw materials, farm produce and time.(iii) Capacity building: The Company currently has more than 2,900 employees and third party workers who have been trained and deployed. Of this, more than 75% of staff are blue collar workers, who are deployed across the supply chain in distribution centers/warehouses, buying, merchandising, new facilities setup etc.The Company has also rolled out a new service where is supplies groceries to kirana stores (mom-and-pop grocers), providing them the benefit of better inventory management and logistics.

Inclusive growth: The Company is currently operational in nine cities, and plans to expand to more than 20 Tier-2 cities in the next two-three years. Over a third of the new cities into which expansion is planned are in Low Income States. ii.	Supply chain linkages with farmers and small and medium enterprises: The Company''s growth will directly and indirectly benefit farmers by setting up collection centers which aggregate fresh agricultural produce directly from farmers, removing the need for middlemen and reducing the opacity of pricing to farmers. By 2020, the Company is expected to have developed relationships with over 3,000 farmers, up from 900 today. At collection centers, the Company hires field staff such as agronomists who engage with farmers and add value by providing advice on best practices. The Company plans to scale up to more than 15 collection centers, from 4 currently. The Company''s expansion will also benefit small and medium enterprises such as bakeries, specialty food suppliers and manufacturers of household products to expand their businesses through the Company''s platform. In addition, the Company also supplies its groceries to kirana stores, thereby enabling these small enterprises to leverage on the Company''s supply chain.iii.	Employment opportunities: Continued business expansion through this Project is expected to create additional jobs, both directly and indirectly, at the sourcing, supply chain, and distribution levels, including in transportation and logistics. The Company has created more than 2,900 jobs (over 2,300 of these are blue-collar workers), and expects this number to grow to over 7,500 by 2020. iv.	Skill development: The Company''s growth will enable skill development for hundreds of people, specifically blue-collared workers, in the areas of supply chain and logistics. Since the expansion will be focused on Tier-2 cities, including LIS, this training will be a useful skill development for these workers as it will be driven by the Company''s focus on training, best-in-class monitoring and efficiency practices. v.	Better quality at affordable prices: The Company will drive better quality of grocery products by integrating deeper into the supply chain, sourcing directly from the farms and collection centers, and minimizing the wastage which results from multiple stakeholders handling the produce before it is sold. The Company also recycles its organic food waste though supplying it for biogas generation.","","","(i) Provide equity financing with ability to fund future growth:IFC will provide patient capital with a structure appropriate to the needs of the Company. Given the asset-light nature of its business, the Company has limited access to debt, and hence it is imperative to the Company''s growth plans to have investors such as IFC who have a long-term horizon and ability to fund the Company''s future growth as required. <br>(ii) Offer global knowledge and best practices in the sector: IFC has made several investments in agribusiness, agri- supply chain, food logistics and cold chain companies (including supply chain development and capacity building) in Asia and globally and will share sector experiences and lessons learned from these investments. Some examples of these investments include National Collateral Management Services (India) , Snowman Logistics (India)  and Shanghai Zhengming Transport Co. (China) . IFC will also explore linkages between the Company and its portfolio in agribusiness sectors such as sugar and poultry.<br>(iii) Implementation of environmental and social standards and Insurance requirements: Adopting best practices by complying with IFC''s environmental and social (E&S) and insurance requirements will allow the Company to operate at international standards. <br>(iv) Potential advisory engagement: IFC actively engages with clients to offer advisory services in agriculture and food supply chain. Some such advisory projects undertaken include working with clients to help improve food safety, productivity of sugarcane farmers, better water management and capacity building for meeting better quality standards which, in turn, improves realizations for farmers.

The owner of MGES, Mass Energy Global Holding Ltd (MEGH or the Sponsor), is the leading independent power producer in Iraq, owning and operating three gas-fired independent power plants (IPPs) in KRI with combined operational capacity of 3,500 MW (1,500 MW Erbil IPP, 1,000 MW Dohuk IPP, and 1,000 MW SGPS).  Erbil IPP is a 1,500 MW Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) power plant whereas Dohuk and SGPS IPPs are currently operating as 1,000 MW Open Cycle Gas Turbine OCGT power plants.   SGPS 1,000 MW OCGT power plant consists of eight GE Frame 9E gas turbines (125 MW per gas turbine, except for gas turbine No. 4 which is GE Frame 9F) and they started operation in phases between 2009 and 2012.  Natural gas is the primary fuel, with fuel oil as the secondary fuel when needed such as when gas pressure is low from the gas pipeline.  Fuel supply to SGPS is the responsibility of the Kurdistan Region Government (KRG).  Natural gas is supplied from a 60 km gas pipeline operated by Pearl Petroleum and connecting Khor Mor Gas Field to SGPS.  This pipeline further extends to Erbil IPP (the total length of the pipeline from the gas field to Erbil IPP is 180 km).  SGPS receives gas from this pipeline through a less than 1 km connecting gas pipeline.  Fuel oil is provided by road tankers.  Fuel oil is received at the unloading facility and stored at fuel oil untreated tanks.  Untreated fuel oil is treated and sent to fuel oil treated tanks. Raw water is currently being supplied from two SGPS wells located about 12 km from SGPS and is being transported to site by truck. A new water pipeline is being constructed to eliminate this truck traffic. In addition, a water pipeline is being constructed to bring water to site from the Zab River, about 30 km away. This river water will be delivered to SGPS and other industrial water users and the pipeline will be owned by MEGH.   Electricity is transmitted to the KRG grid through 132 kV transmission lines.  SGPS was developed as a Build, Own and Operate model under a long term power purchase agreement with the KRG Ministry of Electricity (MoE).  SGPS is converting this existing 1,000 MW OCGT power plant to a more energy efficient CCGT power plant by adding eight Heat Recovery Stream Generators and two Steam Turbine Generators (250 MW each), bringing the total generation capacity to 1,500 MW with significantly improved electricity generating efficiency (around 34% efficiency at OCGT operation, and around 55% efficiency after CCGT conversion, on gross and Lower Heating Value basis).  ENKA, a Turkish company, is the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contractor for the conversion.  The conversion work from OCGT to CCGT started in July 2013, and is expected to be completed in 2016.  The conversion includes an installment of two Air Cooled Condensers (ACCs) as a cooling system for the CCGT operation.  The CCGT conversion will not require expansion of the existing gas pipeline connection.  Electricity transmission from the CCGT operation will be through the existing 132 kV transmission lines.   KRG MoE plans to construct a new 400 kV transmission line system connecting various power plants, including the project site.  The EPC scope of work includes installation of a 400 kV switchyard within the existing SGPS site.  The length and the route of the new 400 kV transmission line is still to be determined.  This is not considered an Associated Facility under Performance Standard (PS) 1, as it is not required in order to link the project to the grid. The conversion of the SGPS from OCGT to CCGT is being conducted within the existing SGPS site, and therefore, no additional land acquisition is required.  The SGPS site was selected and provided to MGES by MoE prior to the start of the SGPS OCGT construction in 2007.  Land acquisition for the 63.5 ha site, which is located in an agricultural area, was taken care of by the KRG and there are no pending land compensation claims.  The closest residential areas are about 3 km from the SGPS site.","","","","The proceeds from IFC equity investment and loan will be used to complete the conversion of the SGPS from OCGT to CCGT, and to release MEGH equity to allow it to meet its equity obligations needed to continue its construction of a 3,000 MW Bismayah IPP located outside of Baghdad which will provide 50% of Bagdads electricity needs.  IFCs appraisal was focused on the conversion of the SGPS operation from OCGT to CCGT as this is where IFC proceeds will be used.  IFC reviewed the following documents provided by SGPS: (i) documentation about SGPSs current Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Management system (e.g. Environmental Policy Statement dated April 2013, Organizational structure of SGPS OCGT, including HSE Department, Organizational structure of SGPS CCGT conversion), (ii) SGPSs occupational health and safety performance data in 2011  2015, (iii) Sulaymaniyah Combined Cycle Project, Water Balance Diagram (Sep 26, 2013), (iv) List of land plots with certificate numbers and date of issue for the total of 6 plots, 254 donums, about 63.5 ha, showing that the six plots were allocated to SGPS by MoE, KRG, (v) SGPS operational procedures that are relevant to IFC PS2 (e.g. Hiring Staff, Employee Manual), (vi) other technical documents about SGPS EHS performance.  In addition, IFC E&S Specialist conducted a site visit to SGPS on June 30 to July 1, 2015.  During the site visit, IFC met with the SGPS EHS Manager, MEGH EHS Director, SGPS officers in charge of OCGT operation and CCGT conversion, and the EHS Manager of ENKA (EPC Contractor).","","","","","","","","","","","","The conversion of the existing 1,000 MW Sulaymaniyah open cycle gas turbine (OCGT) power plant to a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant will have limited environmental and social impacts since the conversion is taking place within the already developed OCGT power plant boundary, and no additional fuel consumption is involved.  The conversion to CCGT will have the positive environmental benefit of improving the electricity generation efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions performance per unit of electricity generated.  The power from the converted 1,500 MW plant will be evacuated through the existing 132 kV transmission lines until a new 400 kV transmission line connection is established by MoE KRG.  The converted CCGT plant will use air cooled condenser cooling system to minimize water consumption.  All considered, the investment is a category B project because of its potentially limited adverse environmental and social risks and impacts.","","","","",37045,"",V-AB - Gas - Thermal Power Generation,"","","",""

The site is adjacent to the main rail, road and power lines running between Lubumbashi, Likasi and Kolwezi on the Katanga Copper Belt. It is connected to the main Route Nationale (RN) Lubumbashi - Likasi by a 7 km private road. Kipoi started producing concentrate from a Dense Media Separation (DMS) plant in 2011 using high grade ore from a small open pit operation. Lower grade ores are placed on a fully lined acid leach pad from which leach solution is fed to a 25ktpa Solvent Extraction-Electrowinning (SXEW) plant, which started cathode production in July 2014 (at which time the DMS plant ceased operating). The SXEW operation is referred to as Kipoi Phase 1. Mining during the last three years has resulted in stockpiling 4.8 mt of copper ore, so mining is not required to restart until 2017. Kipoi is producing 99.995% London Metal Exchange grade A copper cathode which leaves the site by road.The proposed expansion project has three elements: (i) Reclamation and removal of the two existing tailings storage facilities and processing through an acid leach tank which has the benefit of rehabilitation of an environmental legacy issue as well as recovery of fine material not amenable to heap leach; (ii) Construction of a new engineered tailings storage facility on land within the existing mine site adjacent to the heap leach pads and (iii) Construction of an additional 14 electro-winning cells (the SX plant does not require expansion) with an increase in design capacity to 32.5 ktpa. However, there is potential to extend the mine life due to additional resources within the concession which are still under exploration. IFC is expected to provide debt financing of up to US$40.5 million to SEK and equity financing up to US$5 million to Tiger to fund the Phase 2 expansion. The debt portion of the financing would be part of a US$162.5 million package provided together with Taurus Mining Fund. Tiger also holds two other exploration concessions within DR Congo, La Patience (10 km south east of Kipoi) and Luputo (10 km south of Kipoi) plus a small minority interest in Chrysalis Resources which has copper projects in Zambia. Should any of the additional resources in the Kipoi area be proposed for development Tiger is committed to follow an ESIA process consistent with the IFC Performance Standards including cumulative impact assessment, if appropriate.","","","","IFCs review of this project included assessment of technical, environmental, social, health and safety (ESHS) documentation and a field visit between March 23-27, 2015 to assess ESHS management and performance. Meetings were held with the key company personnel as well as with community members of the village of Kangambwa which included the village chief and his advisors, school director, teachers and staff from the clinic.  Some community representatives from other nearby villages (Luafi, Katanga, Bungu Bungu and Lukutwe) were also in attendance. In addition IFC Advisory Services staff visited the project and community members during July 2015 including the provision of a Strategic Community Investment workshop.","","","","","","","","","","","","This is a category B project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure because the Environmental, Social and Health & Safety (ESHS) risks and impacts relate to expansion of an existing asset and are limited, largely site specific within the existing footprint and are adequately managed through implementation of appropriate mitigation measures. The project requires a public disclosure period of at least 30 days prior to consideration by the IFC Board.The mine is a small existing operation and the IFC investment will fund the removal and rehabilitation of old tailings storage facilities and installation of new engineered facility coupled with a small increase in production capacity. A secondary outcome will be better energy and water efficiencies within the same surface footprint. The investment will not result in any significant new impacts. Pre-existing environmental, health and safety issues associated with the project include: occupational and community health and safety; dust control; waste management, including hazardous waste and management of mine residue deposits; water management;  hazardous materials management and transportation risks on roads leading to the site. The company has mitigated these risks by commissioning and implementing a PS gap analysis completed by an international consultancy during 2014.

SEK produced copper-in-concentrate from a Heavy Media Separation (HMS) plant from 2011 to 2014 and transitioned to production of high-grade copper cathode through a Solvent Extraction-Electro Winning (SX-EW) plant in May 2014. Kipoi currently produces 25,000 thousand tons per annum (ktpa) of copper cathode and a financing is being conducted to expand production to 32,500tpa.","","","","","The provisions of the national 2002 Mining Code require projects such as Kipoi to undertake an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) including an Environmental Management Plan (EMP). This was completed by a DR Congo based consultancy in 2008 and was updated in 2009 and again in 2011 to cover both Stage 1 and 2 of the project. The EIA includes a social section but does not cover health & safety.  There are several differences between the DR Congo EIA requirements and the IFC Performance Standards (PSs). Therefore, IFC has assisted SEK in drafting the Terms of Reference and identifying suitable consultants for completion of a fully revised Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) consistent with the IFC PSs. Engagement of the consultants occurred during mid-2015 and the finalized ESIA is due for completion by mid-2016. The new ESIA will be subject to public consultation and disclosure in accordance with IFC policies prior to the start of construction of the expansion project. In the interim, an IFC PSs gap analysis on the existing project has been undertaken and the company has developed this into an Action Plan which defines the mitigation measures which will be implemented to bring the current operations up to the level of GIIP and the IFC Performance Standards within an acceptable period.

The Company has critical scale and is amongst the top 10 private sector NBFCs offering fund and fee-based financial services to its customers, under the Tata Capital brand. A trusted and customer- centric, one-stop financial services provider, TCFSL caters to the diverse needs of retail, corporate and institutional customers, across various areas of business namely the Commercial Finance, Infrastructure Finance, Wealth Management, Consumer Loans and distribution and marketing of Tata Cards. IFC proposes to provide local currency funding to TCFSL by subscribing to non-convertible debentures (NCD) to be issued by the Company. The proceeds of the IFC financing will be channelized to farmers in rural areas for financing tractors and other agricultural equipment.  The aforementioned segments have limited access to finance from the organized sector (the Project).","","",N/A,"",There will be no E&S requirements for this project. The Company was found to be in full compliance with IFC''s requirements of PS-2 on Labor and Working Conditions,"1. Additional Reach: TCFSL''s strategy is to serve farmers in rural areas for financing tractors and other agricultural equipment.  TCFSL has a unique ability to penetrate these customer segments thanks to the Tata brand. The Tata brand is very strong in rural and semi-urban markets. Availability of additional financing for agriculture is very important to the Indian economy given the challenges of improving India''s food security situation. The increase in population as well as disposable incomes in rural and semi-urban areas generate a rapid increase in food consumption demand.2. Pan-Indian Presence and Expert in niche markets: TCFSL is the appropriate partner for IFC to provide financing to under-served segment of the market as the Company is present across all India. Banks focus on larger, more traditional clients and consumer finance whilst the NBFCs tend to focus more on asset finance which is essential for rural equipment financing.   3. Cross- selling products: TCFSL gives the opportunity to cross-sell services of the other group companies subject to applicable regulations and is an ideal development partner for IFC as we explore ways with TCFSL to offer financial services and products to this target customer base, either directly via TCFSL or via other delivery channels.","","","1. Broadening IFC''s Strategic Relationship with Tata Capital Limited (TCL), parent of TCFSL: The Project broadens the strategic relationship with Tata Capital. IFC has two joint ventures with Tata Capital, Tata Cleantech Capital Limited and India Collections Management Limited (ICML). Tata Cleantech Capital Limited is the first green field environment finance company in emerging markets. It is in the process of being converted into a specialized infrastructure finance company to take advantage of the broader opportunities that are emerging in anticipation of the reforms to address operational constraints in the development of infrastructure projects in India. ICML, which was set up to be a specialized collections company, could not commence operations due to certain issues, and IFC and Tata Capital have mutually decided to wind up ICML. The collaboration provided by TCL to IFC through this difficult period has been nothing short of exemplary, and is a testimony of an excellent relationship with IFC. Tata Capital Ltd and IFC continue to look for other interesting and mutually beneficial joint opportunities including in the payments space.<br>2. Funding diversification: Most NBFCs are reliant to large extent on bank borrowings. IFC''s investment would allow TCFSL to meet its funding requirements from a diversified source and assist in reducing bank borrowings.

It is expected that, after several rounds of capital raising and deployment, AREP will reach an optimal size for an initial public offering (IPO) on a major stock exchange and convert into a form analogous to a real estate investment trust (REIT), which will achieve liquidity within 5-7 years. AREP is conceived to become one of the first REITs in SSA and the first Africa-focused collective investment vehicle designed to ramp up to a size feasible for a major stock exchange listing. AREP will target multiple countries in the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region and will provide institutional investors, including African pension funds, with an opportunity for diversification.AREP will comprise: (i) an investment holding company (HoldCo), which will pool investors funds and use them to acquire income producing commercial properties in target African countries; and (ii) an asset management company (ManCo), which will manage HoldCos assets on commercial terms. Investors returns will come from rental cash flows of the property portfolio, as well as from capital appreciation.","","","","",The main E&S risks relate to the ability of AREPs management company to identify the E&S risks and impacts associated with the platform''s investment activities. The management company will be required to develop and implement appropriate E&S risk management procedures to ensure the investments meet IFC''s E&S requirements.,"The proposed project is expected to have strong development impacts. AREP will contribute to the development of capital markets in SSA and bring about positive effects on its clients in target countries. Specifically, the creation of AREP and its eventual conversion into a REIT listed on a major stock exchange will encourage capital inflows from international and regional institutional investors into SSA, as well as overall development of more liquid, diversified and sophisticated financial markets in the region. Further, through improving management practices at its properties and through developing new properties in SSA, AREP will contribute to improving the quality of business infrastructure in the region. The limited availability of high quality business infrastructure has been identified as a constraint to private sector and economic development throughout the African continent, and the modern efficient business infrastructure developed with AREP''s support in its target countries will (a) serve as a catalyst for local urban development; (b) result in improved business efficiencies, reduced operational costs and waste in the supply chain; and (c) cultivate linkages with a broad range of local businesses.","","","IFC''s additionality in this project is threefold: (i) the fact of IFC''s participation as an anchor investor in AREP''s first capital raise may provide other potential international and regional institutional investors with the comfort that the platform''s terms are in line with international best practices and that its investment strategy is justified; (ii) IFC will work with AREP to facilitate AREP''s adoption of best practice environmental and social (E&S), health and safety standards to its property assets; IFC will also support AREP''s adoption of ""green"" and ""climate smart"" technologies to its portfolio properties; finally, (iii) IFC''s regional knowledge and expertise are also likely to be useful in AREP''s work on the development of a pipeline of commercial property assets.","","","AREP is being established by.

In terms of sector exposure, close to half of the total loan portfolio is focused on the agriculture sector. For this project the client will be required to screen and monitor its lending activities against the IFC Exclusion List and the applicable E&S laws and regulations.","","The main E&S risks and impacts of the project derive from the E&S risks of the SME's lending activities, the capacity and system in place to manage these risks, and its practices with regard to labor and working conditions. The company has developed an E&S policy and it is currently implementing adequate E&S procedures to assess and when necessary, mitigate the E&S risks associated with the lending activities. The E&S procedures, among other things, require the company to screen all potential loans against the AMRET exclusion list (which includes all activities of the IFC exclusion list) and ensure compliance with national E&S laws and regulations. The microfinance's E&S risk management is considered overall satisfactory. The company's labor management was found to be consistent with the requirements of IFC Performance Standard 2 on Labor and Working conditions.","",Please refer to the Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) tab in the related Environmental and Social Review Summary (ESRS) document for this project.,37505,"",O-HA - Microfinance and Small Business - Non Commercial Banking,"",10.0 ,"",""

The objective of the facility is to help address an acute foreign exchange (FX or USD) liquidity shortage in the country by availing short-term loans in USD to the banks for settling their clients trade import bills and provide trade-related working capital loans to new and existing client companies.  The facility will be geared towards providing import financing for largely consumer food staples, pharmaceuticals and medicines as well as agri inputs and industrial raw materials.Under the facility, a US$150 million loan will be made available to Zenith Bank PLC, of which US$45 million will be for IFCs own account and the remaining US$105 million will constitute mobilized funding through B loans, parallel loans and/or guarantees.","","","","","","Improved Access to Credit:  Due to the FX liquidity situation, the project will increase access to finance for credit-constrained enterprises to meet trade-related working capital requirements.  By directly financing the short term FX liquidity needs of local banks to support trade and foreign currency working capital finance needs, the facility will support local enterprises, including SMEs, and will have a positive impact on economic activity in Nigeria.Job Preservation and Employment Continuation:  The facility, by contributing to bridging the FX liquidity gap, is expected to have a positive impact on job preservation in import-oriented businesses.  Financial support to corporates and SMEs is, thus, critical to employment preservation in adverse market conditions.  Hence, the facility will have a direct impact on job preservation and employment generation through the banks'' financing of private enterprises.","","","(i)	Catalytic Role: By providing critical USD liquidity to local banks, IFC will play a catalytic role in meeting the immediate trade finance and working capital needs of local enterprises amidst the liquidity shortage and limited capacity of other commercial lenders to provide the FX.  This intervention is seen as necessary given Nigeria''s FX market conditions and the significant role these enterprises play in the country''s import-driven economy.<br><br>(ii)	Market Stability: Local banks require FX funding as international banks are reluctant to maintain existing financing lines as these have reservations about the macroeconomic and political risk in Nigeria. Real sector clients have also approached IFC regarding their inability to obtain LCs on an efficient basis. Therefore, this liquidity intervention, along with the medium term engagement on the capital markets front, will be essential to bring stability to the market for foreign currency borrowing as well as import and re-exports.<br><br>(iii)	Demonstration Effect: In addition to the strong signaling effect of this Facility, IFC could play a catalytic role in market development by bringing mobilization partners that have limited or no exposure to Nigerian counterparties.

The concession straddles the Boké, Télimélé and Gaoual prefectures and has been continuously mined by CBG since 1973. In addition, CBG also holds the exclusive rights to a concession area of 2360 km2 issued in 2005 valid until 2040 which is the area north of the Cogon River, this has not yet been exploited and is not part of the current mine plan. CBG also operates (under a concession agreement from the Government of Guinea) a heavy-haul railway, 120 km in length, from Sangaredi to the CBG plant and port at Kamsar from where the bauxite is exported. All of these facilities have been in continuous operation since the mine opened in 1973. IFC and other lenders are proposing to fund an increase in production from the current 13.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) to 18.5 mtpa by 2018 (the Expansion Project). Guinea produces 9% of the worlds bauxite and holds 28% of global reserves including the worlds largest and highest quality bauxite deposits, grading 40-60% alumina, attracting investment interest from a number of major aluminum companies. CBG is the largest company in Guinea, and accounts for around 80% of export revenues, 12% of government revenues and 7% of GDP. CBG is Guineas largest employer, with around 5000 workers.The ore exists in bauxite plateaus that host superficial laterite deposits. This means that mining is very straightforward in relatively shallow open pits but is widespread and results in a patchwork of mining areas dependent on grade rather than a single large open pit. This results in mined areas being relatively easy to rehabilitate.CBGs shareholders are the Guinean government, which holds 49% of the shares, and Halco, which holds the other 51%. Halco is a consortium made up of Alcoa (USA, 45%), Rio Tinto (UK, 45%) and Dadco (Guernsey Channel Islands - UK, 10%). In 2012, CBG finalized with its buyers (Alcoa, Rio Tinto and Dadco) a 13.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) bauxite contract for fifteen years duration starting January 1, 2013 and has also concluded a 5 mtpa bauxite supply agreement with Mubadala (UAE) starting in Q4/2017. The Expansion Project involves increasing the rate of bauxite extraction, building extra capacity in transport and processing systems as well as making modifications to CBGs existing facilities, equipment and operations. The construction cost for the Expansion Project is estimated at US$ 570 million with a total project cost of up to US$ 752 million (including construction plus financing costs). The proposed IFC investment is a corporate loan to CBG of US$ 200 million comprising a US$ 135 million A loan plus US$ 65 million loan from the Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Program (MCPP). The proposed Expansion Project has three elements: (i) increase of the mining extraction rate (which will include extraction in new areas already permitted within the CBG concession); (ii) capacity expansion of the railway, and (iii) expansion of the Kamsar port and other logistics infrastructure necessary to support the increased tonnage. The timeline for the Expansion Project is rapid, driven by the Mubadala (Emirates Global Aluminum /EGA) contract that requires first bauxite deliveries in Q4 2017 for which a start of construction in early 2016 is indicated. To meet this deadline the environmental, social, health and safety (ESHS) work program related to compliance with IFC Performance Standards is split into three priority areas:Priority 1: Work to close IFC Performance Standards gaps in the ESIA identified as critical for disclosure (completed)Priority 2: Work to close gaps in the ESIA identified as critical for disclosure prior to the IFC Board meeting (for completion by December 2015)Priority 3: Work to achieve compliance with IFC Performance Standards objectives for the Expansion Project with remaining gaps defined in the ESAP. This also includes actions to achieve consistency with the intent of the IFC Performance Standards for the CBG Health, Safety, Environment and Communities Management System (HSEC MS) which covers the existing operations. It should be noted that the scope of the Expansion Project as originally envisaged by CBG has changed. Originally CBG envisaged Phase 1 as an increase to 18.5 mtpa and later 22.5 mtpa, followed by Phase 2, which envisaged a further expansion to 27.5 mtpa. The scope covered by the proposed financing is for an increase in production from 13.5mtpa to 18.5 mtpa, however some of the documentation provided for review (such as the Environmental & Social Impact Assessment referenced below) considers the potential 27.5 mtpa production level.Should any additional increases in production be proposed beyond the 18.5 mtpa financed, CBG is committed to follow an appropriate environmental and social assessment process (e.g.: preparation of an ESIA addendum) consistent with the IFC Performance Standards, including a cumulative impact assessment.","","","","IFCs review of the project has consisted of assessment of technical and ESHS documentation provided by CBG and its consultants. A lenders Independent Environmental & Social Consultant (IESC) and a lenders Independent Technical Engineer (ITE) were commissioned by CBG (under Terms of Reference reviewed by IFC and the other lenders). Each of these consultants produced an independent draft due diligence report prior to the project inception meeting (to commence the appraisal process) between IFC and CBG. At the time of IFCs engagement on the project, the documentation provided by CBG covered only the Expansion Project. However, due to the nature of the proposed investment (a corporate loan to CBG), IFC also requires the existing CBG operations and its HSEC MS to be consistent with the intent of the IFCs Performance Standards over time. The IFC review identified gaps in the information relating to the Expansion Project and this was requested from CBG as well as additional documentation relating to current operations. Such documentation was provided in the form of a Supplementary Information Package (SIP) and has been included in IFCs review. The scope of the due diligence covered the various components of the project as summarized below:Expansion Project Proposed increase in the mining extraction rate (which will include extraction in new areas already permitted around the town of Sangarédi  additional equipment, manpower, a construction camp and maintenance facilities.;Proposed increase in railway capacity  additional rolling stock, new sidings, shunting yards;Upgrading of Kamsar processing plant and port (including extension of the quay)  train unloader, crusher, conveyors, stockpiles, dryers, ship loader and increased port fleet;Upgraded project infrastructure  power, steam and compressed air, potable water, fuel facilities, waste disposal areas; Kamsar and Sangarédi township infrastructure.Current OperationsExisting mining operations at Sangarédi Existing railway operationExisting Kamsar processing plant and port Existing project management  Legacy environmental, social, health & safety management programs (baseline data, procedures, monitoring & reporting)Communities: Historic resettlement, grievancesA project inception meeting to launch the due diligence work was held in Paris on 22-23 June 2015 attended by IFC and other lenders together with key senior CBG management and consultants and hosted by BNP Paribas (financial advisors to CBG). As a result of data gaps identified early in the review process an ESHS focused workshop to define the future work program was held with the same participants as the June meetings, plus the addition of key CBG ESHS staff (the key functional department heads) A workshop was held from 11-13th August 2015 and a key outcome was agreement that additional information requested by IFC and other lenders would be provided by CBG in the SIP referred to above. The SIP is being disclosed as an addendum to the ESIA. Weekly telephone conference calls between all key parties have been held since the August workshop.A field visit was undertaken in September 2015 by members of a Guinean consultancy sub-contracted by the IESC. The site visit included all of the projects key infrastructure. Meetings were also held with a range of local community members and key local stakeholders. At the time of disclosure, site visits by the IFC team and the overseas based IESC and the ITE have not been possible due to travel restrictions as a result of both the Ebola epidemic and political instability associated with the results of the legislative elections in October 2015. Members of the IFC ESHS team previously visited the CBG operations on occasions between 2004 and 2008 when a separate investment was being considered in an alumina refinery development that did not proceed. A visit will be made as soon as possible after World Bank Group travel restrictions are lifted.","","","","","","","","","","","","This is a category A project due to the potentially significant, diverse, and irreversible environmental and social risks and/or impacts inherent to a project of this nature and scale operating in Guinea. The key concerns relate to the cross-cutting issues of water resources, biodiversity, community livelihoods and ecosystem services. The Expansion Project will also result in impacts from physical and economic displacement starting in 2016. The expansion and existing project areas are associated with Critical Habitat under Performance Standard 6. The Expansion Project is also expected to contribute to cumulative regional impacts for which other bauxite mining and infrastructure projects in the region are also contributors. The principal biophysical risks and impacts include (1) impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services; (2) changes in surficial water balance and groundwater recharge; and (3) visual impacts from changes to landscapes. The principal socio-economic risks and impacts are: (1) significant ongoing resettlement and economic displacement; (2) competing claims for limited available land between biodiversity needs and community needs; and (3) legacy grievances associated with CBG operations since 1973, including past resettlement.. The project requires a public disclosure period of at least 60 days prior to consideration by the IFC Board.","","","","",34203,"","B-BG - All Other Metal (Including Tin, Tantalum, Tungsten, etc.)","","","",""

With reserves of 385 Mt grading 48.6% Al2O3 and resources of over 5 billion tonnes, the Sangaredi Mine is one of the largest in the world and is considered one of the best due to its high alumina content and low silica.","","",CBG is currently developing a community investment strategy that will support its on-going community development programs. IFC will advise the Company in developing the community investment strategy.,"",The expansion and existing project areas are associated with Critical Habitat under Performance Standard 6. The project is also expected to contribute to cumulative regional impacts for which other bauxite mining and infrastructure projects in the region are also contributors. The principal biophysical risks and impacts include (1) impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services; (2) changes in surficial water balance and groundwater recharge; (3) visual impacts from changes to landscapes. The principal socio-economic  risks and impacts are: (1) significant ongoing resettlement and economic displacement; (2) competing claims for limited available land between biodiversity needs and community needs; (3) legacy grievances associated with CBG operations since 1973 including past resettlement. PS7 is not applicable as there are no indigenous people in the project area as defined by IFC policies.,"CBG is the government of Guinea''s most important revenue generator and largest private sector enterprise in the country. The Project accounted for 16 percent of the country''s GDP, 20% of the government revenues and employed approximately 5,000 Guinean nationals in 2014. The proposed expansion will yield the following benefits:(i) Increased supply of bauxite production: The expansion will increase bauxite production from 13.5 Mtpa to 18.5 Mtpa further anchoring CBG''s position as one of Guinea''s lead private sector actors and Guinea''s world position as a key bauxite exporter for decades to come. (ii) Contribution to government revenues: Direct contributions to government will consist of corporate taxes, withholding taxes, customs duties and import taxes estimated at US$140 million per annum. (iii) Local employment: CBG has a considerable impact on employment in the country. The Company has 5,000 direct employees, almost all of whom are national hires. (iv) Community development and linkages program: CBG is implementing a range of community development and linkages programs to stimulate economic development in the Boke region. In line with the Company''s growth, CBG will continue to spend on social development programs, ranging from education, health, building local skills and implementing a local supplier chain. IFC will provide ongoing advice to further enhance the impact of these initiatives.","","IFC has considered the governance risks to Project benefits and is satisfied that the Project should be supported. In evaluating this investment, IFC has reviewed a variety of governance metrics, including the Worldwide Governance Indicators, Transparency Internationals Corruption Perceptions Index, the World Banks CPIA and Doing Business Report and the World Bank Groups engagement in the country.   Guinea ranks low across these metrics but has been consistently improving over the past few years.  The GoG has embarked on a comprehensive strategy to tackle governance weaknesses with development partners, including the World Bank and has made good progress in recent years culminating, for example, in the passing of a new mining code that was promulgated in April 2013. The main improvements brought by the new code include its strong anti-corruption/pro-transparency stance. Guinea has completed its EITI membership process and is now fully compliant as of 2015. CBGs mining convention has been disclosed in accordance with IFCs requirements. The government continues to receive extensive technical support from the World Bank and African Development Bank aimed at building capacity in the Ministry of Mines and Geology and improving mining regulations. The World Bank is also engaged in improving public financial management, further ensuring that mineral revenues will be invested more effectively in infrastructure and human capital. The current government which won reelection last October 2015 remains committed to improving governance in the mining sector.","IFC''s expected additionality includes: <br>(i) Provision of long-term funding - The proposed long-term $135 million IFC A loan with a 15 year tenor (out of a total long-term facility of up to $720 million) will be the first of its kind for a Guinean corporation.  <br>(ii) Mobilization - IFC through the MCPP (Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Program) will provide up to $65 million in senior loan funding (15 year tenor) bringing IFC''s total lending to $200 million. <br>(iii) Environmental and social expertise - As the Environmental and Social bank, IFC has played the lead role amongst the arranging banks to assist the Sponsor in completing E&S due diligence and in developing action plans to mitigate impacts over the life of the Project. IFC will continue to support the Company in areas such as biodiversity, resettlement and water management.","","","CBG is a US incorporated company which was established in 1963 following an agreement between the Government of Guinea (GoG) and Harvey Aluminum Company of Delaware, a Delaware (US) corporation, now Halco Mining Inc., to mine the bauxite deposits of the Boké region.

The key objective of Metier II is to construct a portfolio of investments diversified by sector and deal type, which collectively capture the attractive mid-market growth opportunity in Sub-Saharan Africa ('SSA'). The Fund will invest in 8 to 12 control or significant minority investments in mid-market growth and replacement capital transactions. Consistent with the investment strategy deployed by its previous funds, Metier II will seek to invest in high-growth opportunities, some of which may offer cross-border expansion throughout the region. The Fund will seek 50% exposure outside South Africa ('SA').Metier's investment themes build upon the strategy employed in the predecessor fund focusing on sectors that are set to benefit from positive demographic trends, rising investment in infrastructure services, and intra-regional trade. The strategy will have a SSA geographic focus, using SA as a gateway, and moving outside into the rest of Africa in concentric circles. The SSA strategy will thus be primarily buy-and-build with bolt-ons rather than individual standalone investments. The Manager sees opportunities in Southern African companies partnering with local companies in SSA to provide capital, industry expertise, customer relationships and management skills, to take advantage of the market growth opportunities. Metier's focus remains on a similar fund size to their predecessor fund, and remains focused on mid-market opportunities.","","","","","","Metier Capital Growth Fund II is expected to deliver strong development impact in the following areas: (i) Job Creation: The growth of the Fund's portfolio companies is expected to result in strong job creation. Mid-cap growth equity investments, which the Fund is focusing on, have significant reach to SMEs, the largest impact on job creation, and the potential for IFC to develop direct relationships with the underlying companies. IFC's portfolio experience has been that non-SME's in the growth equity space create more jobs than SMEs at a lower capital commitment per job created. (ii) IDA countries:  The Fund will target 50% outside South Africa, which will cover companies located in IDA/frontier countries.  (iii) Private sector development: The Fund will employ hands-on management in its portfolio companies. The Fund Mananger's structuring know-how will be leveraged on, and value-add and growth strategies incorporated by investee companies, leading to improved competitiveness and sustainability.","","",IFC's expected additionality will be:<br>i) The Manager will be able to draw from IFC's experience as they move into Sub-Saharan Africa (ex-South Africa);<br>ii) Provision of Debt & Equity to Investees in the form of co-investments;<br>iii) Improved Governance through IFC's participation in the Advisory Committee.,"","","The Fund Manager is Metier Private Equity Proprietary Limited (Metier'), registration number 2012/004607/07, a private company incorporated in accordance with the laws of South Africa and a Category II authorized financial services provider in terms of the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, 2002 (FSP No 44882).

While planning and preparatory work commenced in January 2013, construction on the project began in February 2014 and the project was commissioned in May 2015; its operations and maintenance (O&M) is being carried out by United Engineering & Power Services Ltd (UEPSL), another subsidiary company of United Enterprises. IFC is considering extending a project loan to the company including an equity investment in UAEL. The International Development Association (IDA) funded Investment Promotion and Financing Facility (IPFF) is also considering support to United and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)/IDA staff are conducting due diligence on the project.  IFC has been coordinating the E&S review of this project with World Bank.The APS complex is located on the banks of Meghna River in the Sonaram Mouza of Ashuganj Upazila, Brahmanbaria District, about 90 km North East of Dhaka in Bangladesh. The APS complex has a number of existing gas fueled power generating units with a total de-rated generation capacity of 1070 MW including the project. Further, there are also four more combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plants with a total capacity of 1,525 MW currently under construction or proposed in the near future within the APS complex. However, 128 MW of existing operating power plants within the APS complex will be retired upon commissioning of the under construction or proposed CCGT plants. The project includes the main plant, which is comprised of 20  gas reciprocating engine generators (9.73 MW each), 20 waste heat recovery boilers (WHRB) and one steam turbine-generator (16.1MW). The reciprocating engines use lean burn technology for low NOx emissions. The engines are housed within an acoustically treated building. Each of the 20 engines has a 30 m high stack. Natural gas for the UAEL power plant is being supplied by Bakhrabad Gas Distribution Company Limited (BGDCL) from the Gas Transmission Company Limiteds pipeline which is also located within APS Complex about one km from the UAEL project site. The gas is being supplied through a dedicated 10 inch high-pressure buried pipeline, approximately one km in length laid along internal roads within APS complex to the gas Regulating and Metering Station (RMS) on the project site. The power generated by the project is being evacuated to the existing APS subs station located about 0.9 km from the project site, which required construction of four transmission towers, all located within the APS complex.

It has 23,000 students, of which 4,000 are graduate students. Most students are in the campus of Bogota; there is a smaller campus in Cali (7,000 students). Javerianas students come mostly from middle income strata (65%) with an additional 8% coming from lower income backgrounds and the remaining 27% of the students from high income strata. The University is looking forward to develop a US$ 94m project, for the construction and equipping of university buildings in the main campus of Bogota (Universidad Ciudad building, and the faculty buildings to house engineering, health and life sciences and medical studies) as well as the construction and equipping of the continuing education building in Calle 125.","","","The University has a clear culture of Sustainable practices.  It has adapted the Papal Enciclica of Sustainability and it wishes to become a Green University.  IFC will partner with Javeriana to implement the first EDGE Educational software. Javeriana will incorporate Green Building KPI's as standards for future constructions.  Furthermore, the University has plans to incorporate EDGE Sustainability Standards for Design in the teaching / academic profile of Engineering, Architecture and Faculty of Environmental and Rural Studies.","","IFCs appraisal considered the environmental and social management planning process and documentation for the project and gaps, if any, between these and IFCs requirements. Where necessary, corrective measures, intended to close these gaps within a reasonable period of time, are summarized in the paragraphs that follow and (if applicable) in an agreed Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP). Through the implementation of these measures, the project is expected to be designed and operated in accordance with Performance Standards objectives.","- Promoting quality tertiary education services in Colombia: Javeriana is investing in professors, lab spaces, arts and sciences buildings, and research.  It will remain as one of the leading universities in the country. It has received 8 years of high standards voluntary institutional accreditation.- Generating Qualified employment: Javeriana will continue to graduate highly qualified individuals, with strong ethics and adequate professional technical and soft skills.  These individuals will not only continue to have high employability given the high relevance of Javeriana''s programs to the job market, but also have very strong community skills.  These will be critical in post-conflict Colombia, where leadership in the regions will be necessary.- E&S: Javeriana will implement IFC Performance Standards in the different faculty and administrative areas.  It will also implement recommendations from IFC''s Green Building specialists (Key Performance Indicators) for suppliers in construction and maintenance contracts.  Javeriana will also continue leading by example in the area of sustainable resources (energy, water).  Also, as Javeriana has leading architecture, engineering and environmental studies faculties, it wishes to implement these EDGE concepts in its academic curriculum.  Finally, IFC will continue to collaborate with Javeriana in the design of the EDGE certification for Education institutions.","","","- Large ticket, long-term financing: IFC can provide Javeriana with a large Loan amount, providing the management with comfort that the entire financial resources for its long term project will be available. Javeriana has financed itself in the past with medium term (5 yr) government subsidized loans that were available on a yearly basis. Javeriana has seen that these funds are more limited given national budget fiscal restrictions due to the lower oil prices. <br>- Industry expertise & South-South collaboration: IFC can provide Javeriana with education best practices advice, derived from lessons learned from IFC''s education portfolio clients. Given IFC''s active relationships with similar universities in LAC, Javeriana could benefit from sharing experiences with these clients.  Javeriana could also showcase to these existing clients, its endowment experience.<br>- E&S Standards: IFC can provide E&S best practice standards to Javeriana, including Green Building/EDGE specialist advice, which is critical as Javeriana engages in construction of new landmark buildings.","","","Universidad Javeriana was established as a tertiary education institution in 1933 (while being founded in the 1600s under the Spanish colony charters by the Jesuit order, Compañia de Jesus).

The NPL portfolios will include mortgage and consumer loans. The project will provide a banks with an integral solution to the resolution of its NPLs by providing a programmatic approach to offloading these assets from their balance sheet through a market-based mechanism.  The result will be improved liquidity to devote resources towards originating new transactions, thus increasing the credit offer.","","","","","","The proposed project presents IFC not only a real opportunity for an attractive return, but also the possibility of a significant development impact. Through this transaction, IFC will support the first step in establishing a platform for the resolution of non-performing loans in the Caribbean and Central America.  As financial institutions in the region increase the sale of their NPLs to independent private investors, the transparency of those institutions balance sheets should improve as these NPLs would be priced by the market. The successful implementation of the Project could foster interest of other investors, which could eventually lead to the development of the DA market in the regions. IFC''s involvement in this program, coupled with a strong package of workout guidelines, would allow it to act positively in the market place by setting an example of a distressed asset resolution mechanism, which could promote best practice in local financial markets.","","","Market Support: The vast number of opportunities for distressed assets investment in the developed world, including United States and Western Europe, is significantly crowding out other regions. IFC''s participation in the project would send a signal to the market that transparent transactions are possible and that IFC is supporting the development of a critical element in the financial sector related for financial cycles. This would support the positive evolution of distressed asset market in the region.<br><br>Liquidity: IFC will provide liquidity for distressed assets investments when liquidity is scarce to non-existent for these types of investments. Accordingly, IFC would be leveraging further private sector investment in this sector. <br><br>Investor Mobilization and Market Development: IFC would play a critical role to mobilize capital from private sector into the acquisition and resolution of non-performing and under-performing assets.

The project is part of the GoJs Renewable Energy Program, which aims to increase renewable energy contribution to 10 percent of the countrys generation mix by 2020.  The project cost is estimated at US$ 95 million and the proposed IFC investment is up to US$72 million comprising a US$24 million A-Loan, a concessional senior loan of up to the same amount from the IFC Canada Climate Change Program and mobilization of up to US$24 million.The project will be located in the Al-Mafraq governorate, which lies approximately 68 kilometers (km) north of the Jordanian capital, Amman.  It occupies a 140-hectare plot located within the 2100-hectare King Hussein Bin Talal Development Area (KHBTDA) for which Mafraq Development Corporation (MDC) is the master developer as mandated by the GoJ.  The MDC area was set up in 2007 to promote private sector investment.  The KHBTDA is located in the Al-Badyeah Al-Shamalyah municipality of the Al-Mafraq governorate, and the land was previously managed by the army as part of the Mafraq military air force airport lands.  The airport is located less than 1 km to the west of the project.  The project will be one of three 50 MW solar projects within the designated solar development park at the KHBTDA.  All of the three sites are greenfield, and none have begun construction. The project also comprises the construction of a 5 km underground 33 kilovolt (kV) transmission line connecting the project to the National Electric Power Company (NEPCO) substation located within the MDC land.  All output generated by the project will be sold to NEPCO under a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) to be signed in January 2016.  The transmission line right-of-way (ROW) will follow the route of the MDC roads and be installed by FRV.  The project will consist of a total of approximately 205,000 PV panels with a nominal capacity of 50 MW AC and a peak capacity of 65 MW DC.  Power will be sent to an inverter, which will then be fed into the utility power grid system through the NEPCO substation.  The Transmission Connection Agreement (TCA) was signed with NEPCO in 2015.  Project procurement and construction will take place between the third quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2017, and the plant will be operational for a 20-year period, with options to extend the lease after that date. There will be one Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contractor and Operations and Maintenance (O&M) provider (the same entity), which has not yet been selected.  MDC will provide the project with access roads, a combined water and firefighting network, and wastewater services, which are under development.  The project is located approximately 5.8 km from the city of Al-Mafraq, and approximately 8 km from the Syrian border.  The nearest communities are the villages of Al-Zbaidiyah 1 km to the north, Al-Zatary 2.7 km to the southeast and Al-Baej 3 km to the northeast.  The area is flat, and the only topographic features are a number of minor ditches and depressions that collect rainwater during the winter rains, with any rains ultimately flowing to the wadi Al-Zaatari.  Although vegetation is very sparse and not ideal for grazing or agriculture, some local herders do pass through the project area with their flocks; other than this short term transient use, the land is currently unused.The Zaatari Syrian refugee camp is located approximately 5.4 km southeast of the project; the camp population is currently estimated at 79,000 refugees.","","","","IFCs appraisal of the project consisted of a site visit to the proposed development site on 5 January 2016 and a review of the available environmental and social (E&S) documents.  During the site visit, IFC discussed the E&S aspects of the project with the developer, their environmental consulting company (ArabTech Jordaneh - AJ), and MDC (the land owner). IFC reviewed the draft Environmental & Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) contained within it, which have been prepared for the construction, operation and decommissioning phases of the project.","","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Environmental & Social Review Procedure as the E&S impacts associated with the project are limited, generally site-specific and could be addressed through the implementation of standard good international industry practices.  The key E&S issues largely relate to the optimization of water use for cleaning solar panels, given the arid environment; the development of Human Resources Policies and Procedures that are applicable to the sub-contractors, given that hiring will likely be done through the sub-contractors; and, the development of a Security Risk Assessment (SRA), given the location of the project in the vicinity of the Syrian border.","","","","",36877,"",V-BF - Solar - Renewable Energy Generation,"","","",""
Ciputra Res Loan,Investment,Environmental Documents,Completed,East Asia and the Pacific,Indonesia,"CIPUTRA RESIDENCE, PT",Regional Industry - MAS Asia & Pac,2016-01-14T05:00:00Z,"",B,Other,"The Project involves a senior loan of $30 million in Ciputra Residence (the company), a leading Indonesia property developer. The company was established in Jakarta in 1989 and is one of three principal subsidiary companies of PT Ciputra Development Tbk (Ciputra Development). At present, Ciputra Residence is wholly owned by Ciputra Development, which in turn is controlled by the Ciputra family.  In 2013 IFC supported the company with a Partial Credit Guarantee for 20 percent of a public bond issuance of IDR500 billion (approximately $50 million at that time).  Bond proceeds were used to support construction of low-rise houses and relevant ancillary facilities across Ciputra Residence developments in Indonesia, primarily in Sumatra and Java. The companys primary business model focuses on build-to-sell and build-to-lease residential properties. The core business involves development of new neighborhood townships and ancillary facilities. Most of Residential houses and apartments are sold in clusters before the completion of construction. A secondary focus is the development of synergistic commercial areas  such as hotels, shopping malls, golf courses - within the township projects. The companys practice is to undertake long-term development, with construction and sales phased over 20 years or more, and to manage the townships and ancillary facilities throughout the periods of development. Domestic Indonesian projects undertaken by the company include the township of CitraGarden City, CitraRaya, and CitraMaja Raya near Jakarta, as well as 16 other projects in various stages of development, including projects in Java, Sumatra and Kalimantan. In the future the company will include high-rise residential developments in some of its townships. The CitraGarden City project is currently over 90 percent complete and will cover approximately 450 hectares at completion. The CitraRaya project is the largest developments that will ultimately cover a total area of 2,700 hectares to provide 100,000 homes to a population of 400,000. Construction commenced in 1994 and is currently just over 20 percent complete. Citra Maja Raya is a new township project, which will be developed over the next 15-20 years.  The company also intend to extend its construction of residential and commercial property development projects to Sulawesi, and Kalimantan.The companys developments are adjacent to or near established urban areas with existing connections to infrastructure and are relatively self-contained and phased. Potentially adverse impacts are generally of a temporary nature and primarily associated with construction. As soon as construction of housing blocks or high-rise residential buildings is complete, homeowners occupy these and construction shifts to new blocks or buildings within the respective estate.Engineering and construction contracts are outsourced on the open market via competitive bid processes with works being completed in a manner consistent with Indonesian regulatory requirements. The company uses local construction contractors with workers typically provided by subcontractors for the construction. Following IFCs previous investment the company developed a comprehensive Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) at the corporate level that is applied at the project level so as to identify and manage impacts and risks throughout the project development process which include the construction phase. The company completes up to 1,200 houses and shop-houses per year in Indonesia. At some of the developments, especially when local authorities are unable to provide these services, the company constructs and operates plants to treat and provide clean water to households and to treat domestic wastewater. In addition, the company provides landscaping and township maintenance services to facilities.","","","","The objective of IFCs review was to evaluate the companys ability to comply with IFC Performance Standards (the PSs) at its various operations. In particular, the review focused on evaluating the ability of the company to meet the PSs, national regulatory requirements, and the World Bank Group General Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines (2012). The review also took into account progress made by the company in meeting the requirements of the Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) for the 2014 Partial Credit Guarantee (#33018). The review relied on documents and presentation materials made available by Ciputra Residence, including materials provided to demonstrate the companys management capacity to provide adequate oversight of its environmental, social, health and safety performance of its own activities and those of contractors. The review also included observations and interviews with the company and contractor managers and staff during site visits in August 2015.  The IFC team visited construction sites related to shop houses, single-family houses, studio apartments, and commercial areas that will include a theatre and market in the two largest township development projects in Jakarta i.e., CitraGarden City near the Jakarta Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, and CitraRaya in Tangerang. The IFC team met with and interviewed company staff, including senior management and those responsible for project management, sales, human resources, and environmental and social performance, including worker health and safety. IFC also met with contractors and subcontractors at four construction sites at two of the Indonesian developments. IFC also interviewed the consultant who completed a labor audit in Indonesia in February 2015. Consequently, the most recent labor audit was conducted in September 2015 and the report was also reviewed as part of this project.","","","","","","","","","","","","This project is categorized as B in accordance with IFC Environmental and Social Sustainability Policy as there are plans and systems in place to ensure the potentially limited impacts and risks are adequately managed.  In this regard, the company has previously developed and implemented a corporate level environmental and social management system (ESMS) that is applied to all projects to ensure compliance with national requirement and those of IFC. The key environmental and social (E&S) issues have been identified as: (i) effective  implementation of the corporate level ESMS to provide systematic and consistent management of E&S issues across all projects and to ensure the land acquisition process complies with IFCs requirements; ii) rigorous implementation of the Contractor Management Plan to ensure provision of fair, safe and healthy working conditions during construction and operations; iii) consistent application of pollution control measures during planning, construction and operations; iv) design of the proposed projects taking into account life and fire safety considerations for public access buildings and incorporation of energy efficiency measures; v) ensuring construction nuisance to adjacent or nearby communities is minimized; and, (vi) active periodic external E&S (include labor) monitoring is undertaken as required and the findings thereof acted upon in an appropriate manner.","","","","",37122,"",D-AA - Construction and Real Estate,"","","",""

Ecom Corp Loan,Investment,Environmental Documents,Active,World,World Region,ECOM Agroindustrial Corp. Limited,Regional Industry - MAS LAC,2016-01-29T05:00:00Z,"",A,Other,"It is proposed that IFC provide up to $50 million to ECOM Agroindustrial Corp. Ltd. (ECOM or the company), an existing IFC client, for capital expenditure in Brazil (from where coffee and cotton is sourced), Ghana (cocoa) and Ecuador (also cocoa) and permanent working capital for general purposes, including providing financing to small holder farmers. The proposed investment would enable ECOM to: i) strengthen its balance sheet with permanent working capital; ii) support its ongoing efforts to further vertically integrate from its coffee and cocoa sourcing operations into midstream operations  (e.g. coffee wet mills and cocoa processing plants); and iii) continue to invest into improving its sustainable (traceable/certified)  supply chain practices.IFC has had a long association with ECOM. Investments in 2006 (project #24433), 2008 (#26705), and 2010 (#29005) provided corporate loans to finance advances/provide long term loans to ECOM coffee suppliers in Central America. In 2012 (#30789) IFC also provided a $50 million C Loan to ECOM to allow the company to increase the amount of working capital, and support ECOMs internal financing needs. In 2015, a $30 million credit facility (#33969) was jointly approved by IFC, IDB and Starbucks for long-term funding for coffee producers in Nicaragua to renovate farms affected by coffee rust.","","","","IFCs Environmental and Social due diligence took place during the latter part of 2015. Supervision visits to ECOM operations in Nicaragua (to review coffee processing and farmer programs) and Guatemala (to visit the companys largest coffee processing operation in that country) were supplemented with visits to operations in Ecuador (to review cocoa processing and farmer programs) and India (to review coffee plantations and processing). Further visits were made to the corporate offices in Dallas, USA. These visits included interviews with key senior management and staff (e.g., production managers, OHS professionals, and those working for Sustainable Management Services (SMS), ECOMs sustainable supply chain entity. A review of SMSs Integrity, ECOMs supply chain management platform/suppliers database took place as well as observations at processing plants and meetings with farmers supplying coffee and cocoa to ECOM. Meetings in Dallas involved the CEO of the company and the company head of environment, health and safety (EHS) and discussed overall environmental and social (EHS) performance, compliance with previous EHS Action Plans (ESAP) requirements linked to IFC investments and provided an opportunity to gain an understanding of the company culture, its relationship to primary suppliers and key customers and how those all of those requirements (IFCs, host nation law and regulation and customer requirements) are integrated and complied with throughout the 35 countries in which ECOM does business. IFC did not visit operations in Brazil; the ECOM business model for coffee is different here with procurement primarily being from well-regulated large scale integrated farming businesses, bereft of the risks seen in supply chains elsewhere. With regards to cotton, ECOM does source directly from farmers. This sector is known to have risks associated with the use of labor; however, ECOM is sighted on the conditions under which the commodity they trade is grown through interaction between SMS staff and these producers. Operations in Ghana historically had no physical presence/assets on the ground beyond offices. Since the Armajaro acquisition, however, the company now has physical assets such as small warehouses/buying stations. Risks associated with this supply chain are described below, as is their mitigation. ECOM has recently decided to scale back its presence in Cote DIvoire and now only sources certified cocoa from that country. The interactions referenced above built on an earlier meeting that was convened between IFC and other development financial institutions (DFIs) and ECOM representatives and third party consultants (hired by ECOM to address key issues related to the environmental and social management system (ESMS), including effluent treatment at the companys coffee processing operations (e.g. wet mills). This meeting reviewed overall progress on EHS performance at the company and the proposed 3-year implementation plan to further strengthen ESMS implementation into ECOMs midstream and sourcing operations.  IFC has had a long and robust supervision program with regards to ECOM. Overall EHS performance of previous investments against agreed upon EHS Action Plans has been mixed. Positive highlights include increases in the amounts of traceable/certified coffee and cocoa procured from origins in West Africa and Central and South America (thereby satisfying the ever increasing demands of end-customers/off-takers in this market space, e.g. Nespresso, Starbucks ) and the numbers of farmers reached by SMS who have benefitted through better farming practices, planting materials and resulting higher yields; other improvements have targeted OH&S assessment, management and reporting within processing operations. However, some ESAP requirements, such as integrated management system development and implementation covering ECOMs processing and sourcing operations, and specifically effluent treatment at its large-scale wet coffee mills in Central America, have been slower than anticipated.  Each mill requires a tailored action plan coupled with building local competencies to effectively manage water characterization levels.  IFC have been informed on mill improvement plans throughout the entire process and will continue to receive regular updates.The company has long addressed the main environmental and social aspects common to agro-commodity traders. Such aspects include the need to develop the broader agricultural sector (through purchasing and logistics) in emerging markets; improved crop production practices and related productivity at the farm-level; supporting the development and implementation of voluntary commodity standards in this sector; and, provision of ancillary services and support to large numbers of farmers. IFC has partnered with ECOM in many of these areas through IFCs Advisory Services programs. It is these aspects, that when combined with both new advances and the maturing of existing elements related to EHS management inside the fence line, that gives IFC comfort with this proposed new investment. Further details on these advances are presented in the relevant sections below.","","","","","","","","","","","","This investment is classified as a Category A project in accordance with IFCs Policy on Environment and Social Sustainability. Considering the inherent environmental and social risks related to the cocoa sector in West Africa and the cotton sector in Brazil the proposed project has potential significant adverse environmental and social risks that are diverse, irreversible or unprecedented. These risks and impacts include potential exposure to harmful child or forced labor in the supply chain, and adverse impacts on conversion of natural/critical habitats leading to biodiversity loss. Prior investments with ECOM have also highlighted labor risks associated with the cotton supply chain in Central Asia. Since those investments, ECOMs business has changed, reducing the already small amounts of cotton that were procured from that region (being replaced by increases from the US and Brazil) and also eliminating the ginning operation that was being run in Tajikistan.  Operations outside of the above regions are exposed to EHS risks and impacts of a lessor nature. These inside the fence line risks and impacts include occupational health and safety risks to workers involved in processing, and impacts to surface waters from improperly treated and discharged industrial effluents.","","","","",36815,"",A-AG - Diversified Edible Agricultural Crops Production,"","","",""

It is also setting up a facility for manufacturing prescription lenses through fully automated machines. The proposed investment (Project) consists of up to US$25 million in equity for a minority stake in Lenskart in order to finance the expansion of the Companys wholesale business for distribution and supply of eyewear products in India and for its prescription lens manufacturing facility. India continues to be an underserved market for quality healthcare products and is a large market for eye ailments. An estimated 350 million people do not have access to prescription eyewear despite having a medical need, due to lack of diagnosis, poor access or affordability. The Company has provided quality eyewear products at affordable prices to over 600,000 people in FY15 and this number is projected to increase to more than 5 million by FY21, supported by the expansion as part of this project. The Company is addressing issues of accessibility, affordability and awareness by supplying prescription eyeglasses and contact lenses on a wholesale basis to several retail partners, who make these products available for purchase online as well as numerous offline locations such as stores and customers homes. Customers can also get eye tests by the optometrists available at these locations. The Companys partners also organize eye test camps in rural as well as urban areas to create awareness on the need for vision correction.The Companys partner franchisees are micro-entrepreneurs and, as Lenskart grows, it is creating capabilities across numerous first-time entrepreneurs in Indias Tier 2/ 3 cities. As of December 2015, it has already partnered with more than 90 franchisees in over 50 cities, of which more than 45 are in Tier 2/3 cities and 15 are in the Low Income States of India.In addition, the Companys products are made available through more than 100 home eye checkup partners conducting more than 300 checkup appointments everyday across the country. This helps expand the market to customers who may be in need of vision correction eyewear but are not aware of the particular specifications of prescription eyewear that will help them.The Company is setting up a centralized processing, manufacturing and assembly facility for eyewear products in India.The Company is focused on leveraging technology as it scales rapidly, applying robotic and mechanized assembly and manufacturing capabilities and monitoring processes at every step of the value chain to drive product quality, process efficiency and low cost production and distribution.","","","","","","The proposed investment is closely aligned to the World Bank Group''s strategy for private sector health care in India. Healthcare is one of the most basic human needs and is fundamental to the well-being and socio-economic development of any society. However, access to basic healthcare remains deficient, if not absent, for many in developing countries including India. To address this issue, public spending on healthcare has increased in many countries, but supply has not kept pace with the demand, which is driven by a growing and aging population. Consequently, the private sector is playing a significant and expanding role in providing healthcare services in developing economies as witnessed in India The World Bank Group seeks to engage the private sector to increase and improve access to affordable, quality health services, particularly in underserved geographies such as low-income states and Tier 2/3 cities, while reducing the burden of out of pocket health care expenditures.-Affordable access to eyewear products in underserved geographies: With this fundraise, the Company intends to expand its distribution via franchisee partners to more than 100 Tier 2/3 cities in India. -Increase in consumers reached: The Company''s eyewear products reached 600,000 consumers in the year FY15 and this number is expected to increase to more than 5 million by FY21, supported by the expansion undertaken as part of this project.-Employment opportunities: Continued business expansion through this Project is expected to create additional jobs, both directly and indirectly, in the sourcing, processing, supply chain, and distribution. The Company has over 300 staff members involved in its direct operations, in addition to over 1,100 througha broader network of 90 franchisee partners, and it is scaling both members rapidly. It intends to keep growing its business to distribute its products through more than 400 franchisee stores and 800 home eye checkup teams by FY21, creating employment for over 2,000 people.-Skill development and manpower training: Lenskart plays a significant role in skill development in three major areas (i) training people to operate complex machinery that Lenskart procures to manufacture lenses (ii) training a growing number of vision technicians and optometrists for home eye care examinations and (iii) helping their franchisees recruit and train staff needed for their operations.The Company has worked in collaboration with Skill Tree, an authorized skill development partner appointed by the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), to develop a Refraction Training Program to help train optometrists. Skill Tree identifies individuals who are then trained through a six month program run in collaboration with Lenskart. People graduating from this program are assessed, certified and given employment through the Company''s ecosystem of franchise and home eye checkup partners.-Promoting Diversity: Of the 1100+ staff currently employed by the Company and its franchise partners, over 15% are women. Nearly 2% of the employees in their manufacturing operations are specially-abled. The Company trains and improves their skill set, and builds a career path for them by offering senior staff supervisory roles and a chance to grow as professionals.-Better quality and lower prices: The Company will provide quality products at affordable prices. Currently, the market is fragmented and small stores use manual or semi-automatic machines, leading to errors in the eyeglasses which are finally given to customers. The Company largely uses fully-automated machines which are much more accurate and economical.","","","-Global knowledge sharing: IFC will be able to share its extensive global experience in the healthcare and manufacturing sectors with the Company, particularly in supply chain development and capacity building. IFC will share its significant industry knowledge and expertise gained from its previous healthcare investments across various emerging markets, including eye care chains located in India (EyeQ), China (Aier), Egypt (Magrabi) and Mexico (Sala Uno). <br><br>-Assisting with key industry relationships: The Company is keen to engage with IFC''s large global healthcare portfolio where Lenskart''s offerings can be mutually beneficial to helping customers access quality and affordable eyewear. <br><br>-Enabling regional growth: The Company could further expand its operations into South and East Asia and other emerging markets once it achieves scale in India. It would benefit from the assistance that IFC country offices in these regions can provide in entering new geographies.<br><br>-Long term investor: The Company values IFC''s suite of financial products and ability to continue to support future funding needs, as it continues to grow. The Company also operates automated finishing and assembly machines and IFC or its financial services portfolio clients can help them with equipment purchase, working capital and debt funding.<br><br>-Best practices: IFC will provide inputs on Environmental and Social best practices (including Life and Fire safety) and on Corporate Governance.

Axion,Investment,Environmental Documents,Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Argentina,AXION ENERGY ARGENTINA S.A.,Regional Industry - MAS LAC,2016-02-24T05:00:00Z,"",B,Other,"The Axion refinery is located at the port of Campana by the Parana River, 75 km from Buenos Aires city in an area of approximately 130 hectares. The refinery is located at the northeast of Campana, in a designated industrial area Campana is a mid-size city (some 94,000 inhabitants) in a moderately populated industrial zone outside the Buenos Aires metropolitan area. IFC is considering a loan to support to expansion of the refinery (the project); further details are provided below.The refinery, designed to process mainly heavy crude (only 20% of light crude), has a total refining capacity of 90,000 barrels per day (BPD) and produces a wide range of products, such as gas oil  (37%), mogas (27%), fuel oil (12%), aviation fuels (jet fuel 7%), coke (7%) and others (10%) (i.e., liquid petroleum gas (LPG), chemical and petrochemical products.)  Gas oil and mogas are mainly sold in the retail market; in addition to transportation companies, industries, farming business and commercial companies in general.  Fuel oil is largely used for power generation while jet fuel, used for aircrafts,  is sold in the two Buenos Aires area airports, as well as in Córdoba (Argentina).  Intermediate fuel oil is generally supplied to cargo vessel, cruisers, and the fishing fleet in key ports of  the country.  Within premises, it stores raw materials and finished products.  Axions main operation units include (a) atmospheric distillation which is the first crude oil distillation step, (b) vacuum distillation which complements the previous distillation, (c) delayed coking which processes the bottoms of the vacuum distillation tower and of the primary fractionation of the catalytic cracking unit, (d) catalytic cracking which cracks the outputs from the vacuum distillation and catalytic cracking unit into diesel, high octane gasoline, liquefied petroleum and a slurry used as feed in the delayed coke unit.  Other operation units include the virgin naphtha and coke naphtha hydrotreaters which prepare the naphtha for further treatment in the naphtha reformer to produce high-octane naphtha, propane and butane.  In addition, the refinery also has a solvents plant, a middle distillates treater, and a lubricants blending plant. Axion has several storage tank farms for the storage of crude, and intermediate and end products of the process, The total storage capacity of 400,000 m3 is achieved with 74 storage tanks, all of which having double containment to accommodate more than 110% of the tank volume.  It also has 12 tanks (bullets and spheres) for LPG storage with a total capacity of 2 million liters.  The coke produced is handled and stored in an open storage area from which it is loaded into trucks or ships through an enclosed conveyor. Axions 90,000 BPD crude oil is currently supplied by a 22-inch, 166 -km-long pipeline connecting the cities of Campana and Brandsen where a crude terminal is located. In Brandsen, this pipeline connects with the main pipeline between Puerto Rosales (Bahia Blanca) and La Plata (part of the Buenos Aires metropolitan area) which is also used by others.  Additionally, Axion has three terminals for product dispatch located in  (a) Campana and (b) Galván (close to Bahia Blanca), both in Buenos Aires Province, and (c) San Lorenzo (close to Rosario), in Santa Fe Province.The refinery transports about 60% of its end-products by ship and has approximately 700 loading/unloading operations per year.  For the remaining 40%, it has a dedicated unit in charge of the distribution of end-products by truck.  This unit operates 24 hours a day and 365 days a year and transports gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, fuel oil, biodiesel and bioethanol. It has a fully automated system with eleven loading islands; four of them for bottom loading and the rest for top-loading.For its operation, the refinery requires industrial water, vapor generation, electrical energy and compressed air.  It satisfies its cooling water needs with water from the Paraná River, which after being used, is returned back to the river ensuring it has not had any contact with the process. Five 300,000kg/hr boilers satisfy the steam demand, three steam turbines generate approximately 18 MW electric power, and sources 12 MW from the main grid to complement its energy demand. The process also requires hydrogen which is generated at the naphtha reformer unit and also provided by an external hydrogen producing plant located on Axion premises and owned by Air Liquide of Argentina.The proposed project, which will be built within the boundaries of the refinery, aims to expand the refinerys crude processing capacity (increase diesel production in approximately 1,200,000 m3/year and gasoline in 650,000 m3/year) as well as reaching a higher conversion (i.e., extracting more valuable products out of a single crude barrel); and producing ultra-low sulfur diesel and gasoline. Thus, it will increase the throughput from 90,000 BPD to 120,000 BPD by installing an additional delayed coker and increasing the capacity of some of the operation units.  In addition, Axion will install (a) combined naphtha and diesel hydrotreaters to treat the naphtha and distillate streams from the expanded coker, and catalytic cracker units, and produce 10 ppm sulfur gasoline and diesel; (b) a sulfur recovery unit along with its corresponding sour water stripper; (c) sour gas scrubbers, for the existing and new refinery fuel gas streams; and (d) an amine regeneration system. As part of the proposed project, Axion will also (a) increase its storage facilities and upgrade the loading capacity to accommodate the additional products and intermediates volumes; (b) increase crude reception and product delivery facilities for additional volume; (c) increase the external electrical supply by adding an additional 60 MVA to the existing internal/external electrical power supply; (d) install a second cooling water tower to complement the existing cooling water system; (e) upgrade the effluent treatment facilities; and (f) increase hydrogen production.  In addition, it will also install a new flare system and associated equipment to handle additional loads to the flare from the new units; a new acid flare which collects the discharges from the fuel gas system complex will be attached to the main flare.  A new air system will be also built, replacing the existing one. The fuels sold via retailing are marketed through a network of 71 service stations operated by Axion and 468 operated by third parties.  The majority of the retailing stations also have a convenience store.  For this operation, Axion also has developed EHS and quality procedures and controls. As part of the project, Axion is incorporating approximately 108 new service stations, mostly managed/owned by third parties. These additions will be completed under an evaluation process of environmental safety and equipment integrity.The additional 40,000 BPD of crude required by the refinery as a result of the expansion will be supplied by pipeline, requiring an expansion of the main pipeline currently under analysis by YPF. As indicated in the ESAP, Axion will inform IFC the potential EHS impacts and mitigations of the additional crude supply.","","","","IFCs appraisal involved the review of Axion Energys (Axion, or the company) environmental, health, safety (EHS) and social performance against Argentinian legal requirements and IFC Performance Standards (PS); desktop reviews of project reports, policies, and procedures; and site visits to its operations in July, 2015.

(the Company, Lionbridge), a MOFCOM licensed financial leasing company, to support its long term funding to extend affordable financial services to the underserved MSMEs in China. Established in 2012, Lionbridge is led by a group of leasing experts with extensive industry experience, and provides direct leasing, sale-lease-back, and extended operational services to SMEs, micro-enterprises and individuals in four major sectors including truck leasing, medical devices, agriculture equipment, and manufacturing equipment. By the end of 2015, the outstanding leasing receivables of Lionbridge reached RMB5.5 billion (US$840 million equivalent), among which 38% was truck/logistic leasing, and 34% was medical device leasing.   According to the management account of the financial statement as of end 2015, the total asset of Lionbridge was RMB6.15 billion, and the total equity was RMB1.59 million. In 2015, the Company generated RMB88.6 net profit, translating to ROAA and ROAE of 1.8% and 6.5% respectively.","","",The proposed investment may be complemented by IFC advisory service in Risk Management with focus on MSME sectors.,"","","1. Promoting financial inclusion: Despite MSMEs being the primary source of growth and employment, MSMEs typically cannot get sufficient affordable financing because of subscale operation and lack of real property (e.g. land, plant), which commercial banks require as collaterals. Leasing has become the most important funding source for MSMEs as it is based on moveable assets, e.g. trucks, machines, equipment, in Lionbridge''s case. In the past, MSMEs could only rely on guarantee companies to get access to short term bank loans, which exposed them to volatility of funding, risk of sustainable operation given the mismatch in the tenure of funding and the life of operation machine/ equipment, as well as a bottleneck in expansion. The proposed project will effectively help Lionbridge Leasing diversify funding sources, improve funding stability and utilization, reach out to more MSMEs and expand credit to them. It is expected that Lionbridge will reach additional 20,000 MSMEs by 2020. 2. Promoting healthy development of the financial leasing sector: the financial leasing industry in China is nascent and for a number of financial leasing companies, the transactions are related to shadow banking. On the contrary, Lionbridge was able to serve the underserved segment with a true leasing model, where the leases are repaid by the cash flow generated by the leasing asset. The success of Lionbridge will set a good example for the whole industry and help establish the right culture and mindset for the industry players, MSME clients, regulatory parties and investors, thus promote the long-run development of leasing sector in China.3. Job creation: the integrated logistics service will enable Lionbridge to recruit truck drivers to deliver the transportation services with Lionbridge''s trucks under financial lease model. Lionbridge has over 1,000 trucks now and targets to expand to 30,000 trucks in 3-5 years, which will create at least 30,000 jobs in the future.4. Promoting healthcare services in frontier regions: traditionally, HD services is not sufficient especially in the frontier region, where basic medical service has not fully covered yet. Lionbridge''s HD center model will largely make HD services available at an affordable price to the rural population, improving the patients'' life quality.",<table><tr><th>Indicator</th><th>Metrics</th><th>Calendar Year 2017</th><th>Calendar Year 2018</th></tr><tr><td>CORE - E and S Management Systems (Y/N)</td><td>Compliance/Enhancement</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr></table><br><br><table><tr><td>The above table reflects aggregate figures or assessments from across the company's associated projects with IFC.</td></tr></table>,"","1. Diversifying funding sources: as one of the foreign MOFCOM licensed financial leasing companies, Lionbridge does not have financial institutions as sponsors thus have limited access to affordable credit loans in China. Most of its current funding requires its receivables as collaterals. IFC''s term lending will effectively diversify Lionbridge''s funding to support business growth; and the potential conversion to equity stake will improve Lionbridge''s capital position in the mid-term.<br>2. Promoting SME leasing sector: while China''s leasing sector is large, there are very few companies that target SMEs and the majority of leasing companies are focusing on big ticket lease market (aircraft, ships, etc.). IFC''s support to Lionbridge will build up capability to serve the MSMEs, leveraging IFC''s MSME industry knowledge and experience working with them across sectors.<br>3.

The project has therefore been categorized as FI-2 in accordance with IFCs Sustainability Policy. Lionbridge provides equipment financial leasing services in sectors such as transport and logistics, medical service, manufacturing and agriculture. By leasing assets, they are predominantly trucks and medical devices. Most of its lease clients are truck drivers, smaller hospitals, farmers and other MSMEs, with the average lease amount per transaction being less than US$50K. For this project Lionbridge will be required to screen its clients to avoid supporting activities with any unresolved reputational or E&S concerns. It is also required to ensure its leasing activities will meet the requirements of the IFC Exclusion List and the applicable Chinese E&S laws and regulations.","","The main E&S risks and impacts of the project derive from the E&S risks of the company's leasing activities and its capacity and systems in place to manage such risks, as well as the company's own practice with regard to labor and working conditions. The company has committed to develop and implement an E&S management system (ESMS) commensurate with its leasing activities to achievement compliance with the above requirements.

IFC will provide anchor investment in the form of subordinated debt/equity in each vehicle, an unfunded portfolio guarantee and/or financial instruments structured that synthetically replicate such structures. In this way IFC will provide credit enhancement for third party investors enabling them to consider this asset class.  In addition to investing in the vehicles, IFC will contract with the vehicles to provide co-investments using IFCs Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Program (MCPP). Under MCPP IFC creates loan portfolios for third party investors based on pre-agreed eligibility criteria. All investments made by the vehicles will be in IFC originated senior loans on the same terms and conditions as with IFCs investment for its own account. All underlying loans will need to meet IFCs own internal standards and IFC will be required to seek independent Board approval for each loan following its standard approval process; it is only upon IFCs commitment for its own account that a portion of the loans would then be allocated to the relevant vehicle.","","","","",N/A,"1.	Given that the vehicles will co - invest with IFC (on the same terms and conditions) the proposed investment will support private sector development by increasing access to long term debt capital for infrastructure projects across emerging markets from an asset pool (i.e. institutional investors located in OECD countries) that has yet to venture into infrastructure investments in emerging markets.  2.	Under MCPP investors approve funding in projects much earlier than traditional co-lenders, providing IFC''s clients with greater certainty of finance and reducing their transaction costs during the project development phase, allowing for a faster process to financial close. 3.

The proposed project is a refinancing and growth program to help Insta expand its Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) production capacity on the back of an increased supply to the East Africa region.Insta is a leading East African manufacturer of enriched food products - RUTF and fortified Corn Soy Blend product (CSB) - for the emergency and humanitarian relief sectors, reaching children suffering from acute and chronic malnutrition. In 2014, Instas capacity comprised 4,500 MT per year of RUTF and 30,000 MT of CSB products.  RUTF is a homogenous mixture consisting of peanut paste, sugar, vegetable oil, and milk powder fortified by 23 vitamins and minerals. The manufacturing process involves automated blending of components, and packing into sealed foil sachets. Products are ready to eat directly from the sachet and have a 24-month shelf life at 30 degrees Celsius. The company has a patent usage agreement with Nutriset, a company based in France, to manufacture a peanut paste for use by Severely and Acutely Malnourished (SAM) persons who are usually fed the product for six weeks before progressing to other food types.An investment to fund Instas new RUTF production facility was previously considered in early 2014. In June 2014 Insta proceeded with the new facility as the move was crucial to elevating food safety standards and increasing production efficiencies. The new facility has been operational since June 2015. Further expansion of RUTF production is expected within the footprint of the existing premises by installation of new, more efficient equipment and replacing the existing facilities with modern machinery to implement and enhance best manufacturing practices. Instas offices and production sites for the RUTF and CSB products are located in the Athi River Export Processing Zone (EPZ), Machakos County, Kenya, approximately 40 km from Nairobi. EPZ was created, and is now managed, by a State Corporation owned by the Government of Kenya through an Act of Parliament in 1995 for the promotion, facilitation, and development of export-oriented investments. Insta leases about two hectares of land; the lease is for a total of 30 years (beginning in 2003.) EPZ management provides 24-hour security, street cleaning services, lighting, landscaping, access to water/ power supply and access to waste and wastewater management services.","","","","IFCs environmental and social (E&S) appraisal for this investment comprised a site visit to Insta manufacturing site, observation of operations, meetings with Insta senior management, interviews of managers and specialists, and a review of available documentation. Also, this ESRS is complemented by Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) materials and a prior review conducted by an IFC team in 2014. Key documents reviewed during the appraisal covered EHS management systems and food safety manuals and procedures, relevant permits and licenses, Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) and environmental audit reports, equipment maintenance plan, available documents related to emergency response, drinking water tests, suppliers questionnaire, documents related to OHS, human resources and labor conditions, training materials, records on waste management, and the IFC industry specialist report were also reviewed.","","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Sustainability Policy because the limited number of specific impacts and risks are limited and generally site specific. The Project is not associated with involuntary resettlement, impacts on indigenous peoples and cultural heritage since the existing facilities are located in the Export Processing Zone (EPZ), a designated industrial area, created in 1995 and Insta leases the land from the EPZ owned by the Government of Kenya. Manufacturing of enriched products to treat child malnutrition is not associated with processing of living natural resources.  Nonetheless, and as noted above, the potential E&S risks in Instas primary supply chain of agro commodities will be addressed through adoption of practices to verify that production is not associated with conversion of natural or critical habitats, child and forced labor, if any. Feasible measures consistent with the Performance Standards and applicable to primary suppliers will be implemented as part of the Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) management system.The key E&S risks and impacts include EHS management system capacity; food safety including Hazard Assessment and Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles; water and energy consumption and efficiency; waste and wastewater management; labor conditions including OHS; management of agro-commodities supply chain risks related to child and forced labor, significant OHS risks leading to life threatening situations, and potential conversion of natural and/ or critical habitats; emergency preparedness and response.

In 2006 the Government of Nigeria privatized the Eleme Petrochemicals Company located in Port Harcourt, the capital city of Rivers State.  At the time IFC provided an investment to Indorama to acquire a 75% equity stake in the operations which was renamed Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals Limited (Eleme or the company); this loan was prepaid in 2012.  The current company shareholding is:  the Indorama Group 65%, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) 10%, Rivers State Government 10%, Host Communities 7.5%, the Nigerian Federal Government 5%, and Employees 2.5%.In 2013 IFC provided Indorama with a $225 million A/B loan to support development of a new urea-based fertilizer plant within the confines of Elemes existing 360 hectare site located west of central Port Harcourt.  Current operations on this site include an olefins plant, a polyethylene plant, polypropylene plant, two nitrogen plants, four natural gas turbines and three steam turbines.  The fertilizer plant is to be commissioned in April 2016 and includes an ammonia plant, urea plant and urea granulation plant that will produce 4,000 tons of granulated urea per day.  In addition, a jetty is being constructed in the nearby Onne port for the export of fertilizer; this will be commissioned at the same time as the fertilizer plant.  A new gas pipeline was commissioned for the new fertilizer plant as of February 2016, and is ready for operations. As part of IFCs investment in the fertilizer plant a detailed environmental and social (E&S) due diligence was undertaken of the plant, the jetty and gas pipeline; the latter two activities were included in the due diligence given they were considered associated facilities relative to the plant.  The jetty is located on a plot of land 6.244 ha in extent and owned by the Nigerian Port Authority (NPA) who are also responsible for operations within the port. The land has been leased to Oil Industrial Service Limited (OIS) for a period of 25 years commencing November 2005, and the lease is renewable for a further 25 years.  Eleme and OIS have formed a Joint Venture Company (JVC) with a shareholding ratio of 51% retained by Eleme, and 49% by OIS with Eleme providing the investment for construction of the jetty. The jetty operations will be managed by JVC and include a quay with a water front measuring 320 m comprised of two berthing sections. Berthing Section-1 measures 180 m and will be suitable for accommodating urea vessels with a length overall of up to 180 meters to serve Eleme.  Berthing Section-2 measures 105 meters and will serve OIS; this will be suitable for vessels with an overall length of up to 105 meters and accommodate break bulk, pipes and containerized cargoes. In addition to the quays, there is terminal infrastructure including an enclosed urea storage facility to accommodate 45,000 metric tons of product, urea transfer facilities i.e., for urea to vessels, an enclosed area of break bulk cargo, a storage area for containers and pipes and vessel off/onloading equipment.  Other facilities for operation of the jetty include a site office, generators, a control room, parking areas, a weighbridge and emergency response facilities.  The transfer of urea from the fertilizer plant will be by road via an existing road network.Eleme appointed LES as the EPC contractor for the jetty who were established for this project and are a subsidiary of Lubrik Construction Company, a Nigerian company.  Construction of the jetty is largely complete with the focus currently being on final equipment installation; further details on the approach to construction are provided in the sections that follow.","","","","In 2012 IFC undertook a detailed E&S due diligence for the fertilizer plant inclusive of the jetty and pipeline and this included a site visit and meetings with Elemes Financial Director, the Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Head who is responsible for EHS, the Quality Control and Assurance Manager, Safety Manager, Fire Safety Manager, Human Resources Manager, Training Manager, Security Manager and Medical Doctor; a meeting was also held with community representatives. In addition, the individual environmental impact assessments (EIA) undertaken for the fertilizer plant, jetty and gas pipeline were reviewed, along with various documentation related to the environmental management, occupational health and safety systems and human resources documentation at the Eleme site.  A comprehensive E&S due diligence of the fertilizer plant, jetty and gas pipeline was also undertaken by Mott MacDonald (MM), an experienced international environmental consultancy.  This due diligence was completed on behalf of various lenders including IFC, and assessed the project against IFCs Environmental and Social Sustainability Framework, and the Equator Principles.Thus for purposes of this project IFCs review has been desk top and relied on the above information allied to the following:Site supervision visits undertaken by IFC and other lenders during the construction phase of the fertilizer plant, jetty and pipeline;Review of the bi-annual independent E&S monitoring reports of the fertilizer plant, jetty and pipeline as completed by MM during the construction phase; and Responses from Eleme to specific queries regarding the project following the decision by IFC to consider a separate investment in the project.The Environmental and Social Review Summary (ESRS) document and companion Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) for IFCs investment in the fertilizer plant was disclosed on 19 October 2012 and these documents are available on IFCs disclosure website: http://www.ifc.org/disclosure (project No: 30967).  Based on going supervision for this investment the E&S performance is rated as being excellent with Eleme having complied with all the necessary actions as defined in the ESAP.","","","","","","","","","","","","This is Category B project according to IFCs Policy on Environmental and Social Sustainability.   The project is expected to have limited environmental and social impacts that will be site-specific and temporary, and none are expected to be significant. The jetty has been constructed with the environs of an established port, will be operated in accordance with recognized E&S and OHS management systems and assuming due application of such systems, will not pose a significant risk to the surrounding environment or communities.   Key environmental and social issues relate to; i) contractor compliance with the environmental and social management system and associated plans for construction including aspects related to OHS; ii) contractor compliance with Performance Standard 2: Labor and Working Conditions; iii) effective extension of Elemes existing Integrated Management System to the jetty operations; and iv) ensuring adequate emergency response for the project components.

Its primary focus is on large commercial and industrial projects (shopping malls, hotels, business centers, government and private offices, industrial plants) for public and private clients. In 2014, RCI acquired a 100% stake in Heitkamp Ingenieur und Kraftwerksbau GmbH (Heitkamp), a German company specialized in civil works, infrastructure construction (including railroads, metros and traffic tunnel construction), cooling towers and sewage treatment of nuclear power and thermal power plants, and industrial complexes.

There are no known significant agricultural and industrial uses of Coruh River in Georgia. Therefore, it is considered that Ozluce HEPP operation and Capans Creek regime do not affect the Çoruh River regime in any significant way and can be considered insignificant in the overall flow management of these streams, the wider catchment areas, and overall water balance of the region. Sena HEPP (22 MW) is located on the main stream of Aras River, which is 1072 km long, of 548 km is in Turkey and the rest is in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran.

GTLP provides liquidity or guarantees to global or regional banks with large financial institution networks.  Through GTLP, banks are able to grow their credit limits, manage risk, and support trade in the emerging markets. The proposed project involves establishing a funded risk sharing facility (the Facility) with UniCredit SpA (UniCredit or the Bank) for up to US$500 million to share the risk on a portfolio of emerging market issuing banks.","","","","","","The Facility is expected to have the following development impacts:- Increased access to finance: The project will increase access to finance for the Emerging Market importers and exporters.  Improved availability of credit is expected to benefit local enterprises (producers and importers, including SMEs) along the value chain and therefore support growth, sustain employment, and encourage the generation of higher incomes.   - Strong demonstration effect through partnership with a major international bank and by mobilizing other program participants to support trade finance, the Project will have a strong demonstration effect by encouraging greater local/regional bank participation in EM trade finance thereby increasing access to finance for local importers and exporters.","","","IFC''s additionality is largely derived from GTLP being an innovative exposure and capital management instrument.

These factors are allowing for increased trade that the Project is targeting.  At the moment, there is no other risk mitigation instrument that has the scope of GTLP that covers over 400 EMIBs with the primary purpose of supporting emerging market trade flow.

The first SIS school was established in Indonesia in 1996 in South Jakarta  and the following 6 were opened during 2003  2011 in other cities across Indonesia (cities such as Medan, Semarang and Cilegon). Seeking to go even further, in 2012 the Group opened its pilot Tier B school in Palembang (in Sumatra). Currently this is a Kindergarten to Grade 6 school. After three years of operations the school has 167 students, which is expected to increase to 450 as the children grow and the higher age groups are filled. Secondary education is expected to commence at the Palembang school from academic year 2016/2017.The group now wants to expand their footprints, including replicating the Palembang pilot project, by opening 3-5 more schools in the next 5-7 years in more locations (for example cities such as Manado, Makassar in Sulawesi, Banjarmasin in Kalimantan, Pontianak, Jambi, in Sumatra) still to be defined.

It is anticipated that the project will begin construction by April 2016. Project cost for both the Plant and the Terminal are estimated at $1.1 billion which the company expects to finance with both debt (approximately 55%) and Sponsor equity (45%).  IFC is proposing to provide up to US$150 million in the form of an IFC A Loan. The combined cycle of 3 units of gas and steam is to be supported by a heat recovery system. The produced energy will be delivered to the Costa Norte substation as per established on the Power Purchase Agreement. The LNG Terminal will include a new berth for LNG ships and one above ground storage tank with 180,000 m3 of capacity. The terminal has been sized to accommodate LNG vessels up to 180,000m3 which more than covers the gas supply requirement of the plant.  The three main functions of the terminal and associated system include: (a) download of the LNG on a pier parallel to the coast (""Jetty"") and cryogenic pipes up to storage tank (through which gas will be transported at temperatures minus 160 degrees centigrade); (b) LNG storage in the storage tank; (c) regasification and onshore gas delivery to the power plant.The plant and the terminal will be built on a 20-hectare site, located in an industrial area near the Atlantic entrance of the Panama Canal in Telfer Island, in the province of Colon (approximately 60km northwest of Panama City), leased to the company by the Panama Ports Company (PCC.) The project site borders to the North with the storage and fuel supply tanks and the pier of the Telfer Tanks Company. To the South it borders unused land forming part of the Panama Ports concession. To the East it borders with the road that ends in the Pier 16 and to the West with the entry of the Atlantic sector of the Panama Canal and Manzanillo Bay. As the project is located in the so-called compatibility area of the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) it needs to be compatible with ACP operations and requires the approval of ACP. This process evaluates the project from an operational stand point as well as potential environmental risks and impacts on ship traffic.The site offers good access to road transportation and the nearby Cristobal port and it is located in a zone designated for industrial activities with a limited population in the immediate vicinity.The socio-economic area of influence of the project includes the following populations: Cristóbal, Barrio Norte, Barrio Sur, Ciudad Arco Iris, Puerto Escondido or Urbanización El Esfuerzo and Margarita located at between 0.37 km and 4.0 km from the project site.The approach bay to the dock is located within the breakwater in the Atlantic sector of the Canal and adjoins to the West with the path used for all the ships that cross the Canal.  The bathymetric studies conducted as part of the project reflect current water depth from 0.80 to 2.39 m in the jetty area, and some depths reaching 11m on the turning basin area. Thus to ensure the draft required by the LNG vessels and the FSU to access the dock, as part of the project, GNA will dredge (a) a navigation channel that connects with the navigation route of the Atlantic access of the Panama Canal, (b) a maneuvering area within the Manzanillo Bay and (c) a strip of access to the pier. The estimated dredging need varies from 2.6 to 3.5 million cubic meters, depending on the final agreement with the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) for the maneuvering operation. It is estimated that to reach the needed depth of 14m, approximately 3.5 million m3 of material will be removed within an approximately 62 ha area.  The site selected for the disposal of the dredged material is located in Limon Bay to the East of the entrance of the Panama Canal, in an area of approximately 60.72 ha and a depth of 21 to 23 m.  This site is located approximately 8.5 km from the project site and requires authorization from the Panama Marine Authority (AMP).  The final disposal area for the dredged material is not within areas defined for fishery use, and according to the ACP Use Plan, it is designated as an area of anchorage for vessels awaiting passage through the Canal and has been used previously by the AMP for disposal of dredged material.","","","","IFCs appraisal reviewed AESs Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS), social and labor management capabilities and its ability to ensure compliance with Panamanian regulatory requirements and IFCs Performance Standards (PSs) during the construction and operation of the project.

It also entails the construction of power evacuation facilities to interconnect the generation plant with the existing electricity transmission network. The Project will be developed under two special purpose vehicles: Gas Natural Atlantico, S. de R.L, as the power plant owner, and Costa Norte LNG Terminal S. de. RL, as the LNG terminal owner. The Project will sell 350MW of capacity and associated energy to 3 distribution companies: EDEMET, ENSA and EDECHI, under 10-year power purchase agreements (PPAs) awarded in September 2015 through a competitive bidding process led by ETESA  the state-owned transmission company. The remaining capacity and energy generated by the Project will be sold on a merchant basis in Panamas wholesale electricity market.","","","","","Key environmental and social impacts associated with this Category A project include air emissions (including potential cumulative impacts on ambient air quality from multiple sources in the area); emergency preparedness and response; contractor management, including worker accommodation, during construction; dredging and associated marine spoil disposal; thermal plume creation due to return of cooling water into the sea; operational noise impacts on nearby communities; hazardous materials management and related community safety concerns; and limited economic displacement. No impacts on cultural heritage or Indigenous People have been identified for this project.","Upon its development, the Project is expected to be the first gas importing terminal in Central America. It will diversify the Panamanian electricity sector''s generation mix away from its historical dependence on fuel oil, which price has been volatile, and hydro generation, which capacity is largely used and highly seasonal. By providing efficient large scale base-load low cost electricity generation, the Project will also enhance energy security, foster competitiveness and long term sustainable economic growth for the country. It will furthermore enable the implementation of large-scale lower-emission technology power generation sources, decreasing overall greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, via the Central American Electrical Interconnection System, the Project''s benefits could be extended to the larger Central American region.Taking advantage of its strategic location close to the Panama Canal and optimizing its logistical infrastructure, the Costa Norte terminal will provide a platform for the larger use of natural gas in Panama''s economy beyond Gas Natural Atlantico, in particular for bunkering.The demonstration impact of the Project is expected to be strong, as its successful development is likely to facilitate the conversion to natural gas of existing diesel-fired generation plants in Panama. Its gas to power model may also be replicated across the Central America region.","","","IFC''s additionality derives from: (i) its provision of very long term debt financing tailored to match the Project''s needs, and (ii) its readiness to take exposure to the Project''s merchant risk well beyond the 10 year PPA period. IFC''s funding on a parallel basis with other developmental financial institutions complements shorter term debt financing from commercial banks to provide a comprehensive long term sustainable debt package to a project with large debt requirements. IFC''s additionality also comes from (iii) its strong technical know-how and sector knowledge valuable in structuring and assessing this complex transaction; and (iv) IFC''s environmental and social standards applied to the Project which will set key benchmarks for the sustainable development of this leading infrastructure project.","","","Both Project vehicles are Panamanian entities indirectly owned by two leading investors in the country: AES Corporation for 50.1% and the Motta Group for 49.9% (together, the Sponsors).

The proposed project targets to expand the width and depth of the corporate bond markets in Vietnam, to broaden the investor base of the Vietnamese bond markets, and to support and provide Vietnamese private sector companies with better access to capital.","","","","","The main risks of this project are associated with the Companys investments in sectors of potentially high E&S risks such as oil and gas, agriculture, steel manufacturing and construction as well as the Companys comparatively limited ability to influence these companies to mitigate E&S risks. The key potential impacts, which the Companys E&S management system is designed to identify and either avoid or mitigate, may include poor labor practices; health and safety; significant pollution incidents; large scale physical resettlement; commercial logging in primary moist forest, and harvesting of wild fish populations; impacts on Indigenous Peoples and cultural heritage. For green-field sub-projects there could also be E&S risks related to land acquisition and resettlement as well as health and safety.

('Consorcio' or the 'Holding') to support the Holding's growth in Chile and its regional expansion outside of its home market. Consorcio is one of the leading financial groups in Chile with almost 100 years of existence. Consorcio is mainly formed by three insurance companies, (Consorcio Seguros de Vida, Consorcio Seguros Generales, and CNLife Seguros de Vida) and a bank (Banco Consorcio or the 'Bank').","","","","","","The Project will support a local financial player with deep roots in LAC, which is expected to diminish the volatility derived from large international investors entering and exiting the developing markets. Furthermore, the Project will support the development of the insurance sector in Chile and the region. Increased insurance coverage allows households, companies and investors to assume more risk than would otherwise be possible on their own, while protecting productive assets and income. In addition, insurers deploy long-term funds into the economy, allowing for long-term fund accumulation, thus supporting economic development and infrastructure build-up. This is particularly relevant for insurers such as Consorcio with a strong life insurance business, which take on long-term liabilities to provide life coverage to their policyholders and therefore seek long-term assets to invest in. Finally, part of the Project's funds will be used to support Consorcio's south-south expansion strategy. As the largest life insurance player in Chile, an advanced insurance market in the region, the Company is expected to bring capacity building to less developed insurance sectors in the region, strengthening these markets.",<table><tr><th>Indicator</th><th>Metrics</th><th>Calendar Year 2017</th><th>Calendar Year 2018</th></tr><tr><td>CORE - E and S Management Systems (Y/N)</td><td>Compliance/Enhancement</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr></table><br><br><table><tr><td>The above table reflects aggregate figures or assessments from across the company's associated projects with IFC.</td></tr></table>,"",IFC would provide the equity support that the Holding requires to expand both in Chile and in the region.

While the insurance branch centers its operations in personal services (98.4% - Life and Pension), Banco Consorcio focuses in corporate and large small and medium enterprise ('SME') clients. The Bank's portfolio is composed mostly of medium to low environmental and social ('E&S') risk transactions, therefore the Project has been classified as Category FI-2, according to the IFC's Sustainability framework. However, some of the Bank's exposures are in higher risk sectors such as energy, agro-forestry and infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;","","[The key risks and impacts derive from Consorcio Group's capacity to implement a management system able to identify and manage the potential environmental and social risks associated to its investments and sub-projects.

Karaca Hydro,Investment,Environmental Documents,Active,Europe and Central Asia,Türkiye,KREMNA ENERJI URETIM VE TICARET A.S.,Regional Industry - INF ECA,2016-04-04T04:00:00Z,"",B,Other,"Kremna Elektrik Uretim A.S. (Kremna, or the company), a special-purpose vehicle incorporated in Turkey and owned by Gama Enerji Anonim Sirketi (Gama or the sponsor), is acquiring operational rights of the electricity generation assets of Karacaören I and Karacaören II hydropower projects on the Aksu River in southwestern Turkey, about 100 kilometers north of Antalya (the project). Gama was the winning bidder at a privatization tender held in November 2015 for the two projects, which have a total generation capacity of 78.4 megawatts (MW), 32MW for Karacaören I and 46.4MW for Karacaören II. Gama is a Turkish company active in the water and power sectors in Turkey and the Middle East since the early 2000s. Gama currently has 303.5MW in operational installed capacity, of which renewables contribute 26 percent. IFC and the IFC Asset Management Companys Global Infrastructure Fund, have a 27 percent equity stake in Gama (project #32258 disclosed on September 15, 2014). Gama has now approached IFC for a $47 million A-loan for the Karacaören project. Karacaören I and II are currently owned and operated by the Turkish Electricity Generation Corporation (EÜA). The acquisition and project turnover are expected to be complete by mid- to late 2016, with generation to continue without interruption. The acquisition will include the intakes, powerhouses, and tailraces of both Karacaören I and II. The acquisition also will include about 100-200 meters of access roads that lead from public roads to the powerhouses. Water flows for power generation will continue to be dispatched by the General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI). DSI will retain control and ownership of the dams and reservoirs, spillways and floodgates, although the company will be responsible for operating the gates under DSI direction if necessary. The Karacaören I dam is a clay-core earthfill structure 93 meters high. The dam impounds a reservoir of about 45.5 square kilometers. The reservoir holds up to about 1.2 billion cubic meters of water, enough for about six months electricity generation. A number of holiday homes and resorts are on the shores, and it supports many floating fish farms. As noted, neither the dam nor the reservoir are part of the acquisition. The intake, which is part of the acquisition, is separate from and south of the dam; water flows 468 meters through a tunnel to a surge tank and penstock, thence 207 meters to the powerhouse, which lies at the downstream toe of the dam. The powerhouse holds two 16MW JM Voith turbines, which since 2002 have operated at 37.1 percent capacity to generate an average of 104.1 gigawatt hour (GWh) per year. Water is discharged through four gates to the rock-armored bed of the Aksu River. Since the dam was completed in 1990, no floodwaters have had to be released through the floodgates and the spillways have not been used. Karacaören I also includes an administration compound several kilometers from the dam and powerhouse. This compound has several office buildings, a primary school attended by 125 local children, several residential buildings, a mosque, and a residence occupied by the local mukhtar (village headman). Apartments in the residential buildings formerly housed EÜA staff and workers, but most are now vacant. A small store on the property serves local residents. The Karacaören II dam is located 10 river kilometers downstream of Karacaören I and is a concrete structure crossed by highway 685. The dam is 52 meters high and impounds a reservoir that holds about 33.8 million cubic meters, enough water to generate electricity for only 24 hours. An intake near the dam passes water into and through a tunnel 4.45 kilometers long to a surge tank and penstock, then 410 meters to the powerhouse. Electricity is generated by two 23.2MW Harbin turbines, which in recent years have operated at 38.3 percent capacity to generate about 155.5 GWh per year. Water is then discharged through four gates into the concrete- and rock-armored channel of the Aksu River, which at the Karacaören II tailrace is the backwater from a small hydropower project about three kilometers downstream. Since the dam was completed in 1993, floodwaters have had to be released through the floodgates and spillways only one time, in 1998. Karacaören II operates only when water is being released from Karacaören I, which is going to be regulated by water usage agreement. Although the Karacaören I reservoirs capacity would allow peaking generation, power production and releases during farmers growing season are going to be regulated according to the water usage agreement.","","","","IFC has reviewed Environmental Due Diligence Reports (EDDRs) prepared by the Presidency of Privatization Administration (PPA) for the privatization program. IFC also reviewed a technical and environmental due diligence report prepared in January 2016 by an international consultant for another potential investor, and an environmental and social due diligence report prepared for Gama, in February 2016, by a national consultant. Further, IFC environmental and social specialists visited the two hydropower sites on February 8-9, 2016, and interviewed Gama corporate personnel and current EÜA managers and staff. Gama has not yet prepared project-level environmental and social management plans for Karacaören I and II, but will do so in coming months. These plans are listed in the agreed Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) disclosed in this review summary. The company has made good progress in complying with IFC environmental and social (E&S) requirements and the associated performance of the existing corporate equity investment has been satisfactory based on IFC supervision to date. At the time of the IFC equity investment in Gama, a number of corporate management plans were reviewed and commented. These include a Human Resources (HR) Management Policy, Waste Management Plan, Security Management System Manual, Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan, Sediment and Debris Disposal Management Plan, and a Contractor Performance Management and Monitoring Procedure.","","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Policy on Environmental and Social Sustainability because the environmental and social impacts that could result are limited and site-specific, and can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards and good international industry practices. No new environmental and social impacts are expected to occur as a result of the acquisition and continued operation of these generation assets by the company, but rather a continuation or even a reduction in existing impacts. Based on the review of available project information, key project-related EHS and social issues were identified as being related to stakeholder engagement, occupational health and safety, potential changes in the amenities provided to local communities in the Karacaören I administration compound, and the potential requirement for some minimum environmental flows to be discharged from the powerhouses and/or through the Karacaören II spillway.","","","","",37872,"",V-BA - Large Hydro - Renewable Energy Generation,"","","",""

The oncology hospital will be the first cancer treatment center hospital in the state of UP, and will be operated under a joint venture between Regency and Health Care Global (HCG), Indias largest specialist cancer treatment provider.  The project will support Regency to add multi-specialty, renal and dialysis, and oncology care facilities in other cities of central and eastern UP, under its own brand and through the joint ventures with Fresenius and HCG.","","",N/A,"","Key E&S risks and issues related to this provisional Category B Project include: adequate social and environmental assessment of the impacts of the project; the companys capacity and systems to manage social, environmental, health and safety aspects of its existing and proposed operations in compliance with legal requirements as well as IFC Performance Standards (PSs) and World Bank Group (WBG) Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) guidelines; engagement with local communities in accordance with local requirements and IFC PSs; assurance of fair, safe and healthy working conditions during both construction and operation; management of wastes (particularly biomedical and hazardous waste), emissions and effluents; life and fire safety (L&FS) management for all hospital buildings in accordance with WBG EHS guidelines; and resource efficiency (water and energy efficiency).","i)	Providing healthcare to a LIS - The state of Uttar Pradesh lags behind India and other states in terms of healthcare infrastructure - it has 0.6 beds per 1000 people compared to an all-India average of 0.9 beds per 1000 people. In UP, private health care is highly unorganized and dominated by small standalone hospitals, with a negligible presence of corporate groups. Thus, there exists a substantial gap in UP''s healthcare delivery. Investing in Regency will help expand quality healthcare services within this most needed state. ii)	Skill development - As Regency expands, employment of more doctors and nurses would result in skill-training and thus addition of trained healthcare manpower in the country. Regency also operates a nursing school to train nurses to meet demand of its hospital. The Company is also implementing a training plan with Fresenius for skilled dialysis technicians, who will be required to fuel the growth expected under the Fresenius JV and shop-in-shop nephrology model.iii) Increase in patients reached - Since the company is planning to increase its bed capacity by almost 200% over the next few years, the Project is expected to increase the number of patients reached by a quality healthcare service provider over the next few years.","","","i)	Long-term partnership with a strategic client - Regency operates and plans to expand in IFC''s priority regions - low income states (LIS) in India, primarily within the focus state of UP. This is an opportunity for IFC to form a long term partnership with a healthcare provider which provides care in an LIS, and is the first in the state to achieve NABH accreditation, in addition to its laboratory being accredited by NABL. <br><br>ii)	Demonstration effect - This project would be IFC''s first health sector investment exclusively in UP. Investing in a provider of good clinical practices will have a strong demonstration effect in the State.  IFC investment in an Indian Tier II city in a key LIS will send a strong signal of World Bank Group support of private sector development in the healthcare segment in UP and in India.<br><br>iii)	Knowledge sharing and industry relationships - IFC will share with the Company the significant industry knowledge and expertise gained from previous investments in the healthcare sector across India and other emerging markets. The Company will also be able to leverage IFC''s networks and contacts in the healthcare industry across the globe.<br><br>iv)	Incorporating best Environment and Social standard (E&S) practices - Having IFC as an investor will promote Regency''s adherence to best practices in E&S, especially in life and fire safety and potentially for green building design.","","","Regency is promoted by its Managing Director, Dr. Atul Kapoor, and his wife, Dr. Rashmi Kapoor, who heads the Companys Pediatrics department.

The others sectors include renewable energy (e.g. off-grid solar power to households and small enterprises and hydropower), infrastructure (e.g. road construction through securitization) and agribusiness; the exposures to these sectors are expected to be limited.   The overall E&S risks and impacts associated with these transaction are considered limited and can be addressed through mitigation measures.  The overall portfolio risk is thus considered medium.

For the financial services investments, the main concerns relate to the lending portfolios, particularly for SME lending and the labor and working conditions in the financial institutions.  For the other sectors, although these investments are expected to be limited, the fund manager will need to assess sector-specific risks such as supply chain risks, working conditions, harmful child labor and forced labor in the agriculture sector; and land acquisition, occupational health and safety and community impacts for the hydro projects.  It is noted that the fund will only be investing in bonds and in some circumstances may need to rely on publicly available information for its due diligence, thus the fund will have limited leverage in influencing the bond issuers on E&S risk management. Nonetheless, the fund needs to implement an E&S risk management framework in order to be able to identify and manage the main E&S risks and impacts associated with these investments.  ALCB Fund has an Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) which has only recently been developed.  In order to meet IFC's requirements for this project, a few improvements need to be made to the E&S due diligence process in the ESMS.

In addition, the company is also looking to diversify its activities by developing and taking partial ownership stakes in a select number of independent power projects in Egypt. IFC is considering supporting the company by making an investment of up to US$ 40 million, comprising up to US$ 20 million in senior debt and $20 million in equity/quasi-equity.Hassan Allam Construction (H.A.C.) is the main Holdings subsidiary and the source of almost all of the companys revenues at present. Subsidiaries in Saudi Arabia and Algeria were established in 2011 and 2009 respectively. HAC is expanding rapidly, having nearly doubled in size in the past two years.  HAC has a diverse backlog including roads, electric power plants, commercial buildings (e.g. malls), airports, wastewater treatment plants, transmission lines, industrial plants and facilities, residential buildings and public buildings. At the time of appraisal, HAC had 38 active and new projects in Egypt and an additional eight joint venture projects in that country. About 70 percent of Egyptian projects are in and around Cairo and the remainder scattered throughout the country. HAC is primarily a construction contractor; however, it is increasingly evolving into an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) company, with developing in-house design capabilities. HAC subcontracts certain aspects of its work including at times tiling, glasswork, some electromechanical work, and other specialty services. For some projects, HAC is also responsible for commissioning and then operation and maintenance. It is typical for HAC to procure subcontract support for such operation and maintenance. HAC has a number of divisions, subsidiaries and associates in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Algeria. In Egypt, associates include Arabian Concrete Roads (with a 49.9 percent share owned by HAC), National Pipes Company (40% owned), a Wood Workshop, Brick Factory, Aggregate Quarries and Steel Fabrication division. In Saudi Arabia, HAC currently has one active construction project in infrastructure.  In Algeria, HAC has seven projects, including roads, petrochemicals, power, and infrastructure.HAH also established a number of subsidiaries recently: (1) H.A.C. Roads & Bridge is a contractor for roads & bridges, (2) 3S Ready Mix Concrete which started operations at the beginning of 2016 as a strategic arm to serve in-house and external demand of ready mix concrete, and (3) H.A.C.

It is important to note that HAH and HAC two separate legal entities and, at present, some organizations and managers serve both companies. The company is also in the process of expanding beyond the construction business, so existing business and HSE systems are not yet entirely separate but rather serve both entities, and other subsidiaries as well.In addition, IFCs E&S specialists visited four construction sites in Egypt  highway, commercial mall, wastewater treatment plant, and an airport project - all in and around Cairo, with interviews held with project-level site and construction managers as well as the project HSE managers.","","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category A project according to IFCs Policy on Environmental and Social Sustainability.

No expansion of existing facilities or launch of new business will be conducted by the company as a part of this project. Astarta is one of the leading primary agriculture producers and commodity processors in Ukraine. They are the largest Ukrainian producer of sugar and milk, with a total output of 355,000 tons of sugar, 103,000 tons of milk, 190,000 tons of soybean products and 790,000 tons of grains and oilseeds in 2015. Key Astartas operations are as follows: Crop production: Astarta currently has 245,000 ha under management. Astarta has a diversified crop portfolio with the main crops grown by the company in 2015 being soy (26%), corn (18%), sugar beet (14%), wheat (18%), sunflower (10%).Sugar production: the company currently operates nine sugar plants with about 43,000 tons per day (tpd) processing capacity for sugar beets. It sells sugar to retail chains, beverage, confectionary and other food sector companies, and to traders. Approximately 80% is sold to large industrial customers.

The applicable requirements are the IFC Exclusion List, the National E&S Laws in the countries where portfolio companies are located and the IFC Performance Standards.","","[The main E&S risks and impacts of this project relate to the ability of the Fund Manager to conduct adequate E&S due diligence and monitoring to identify and manage the E&S risks associated with the activities of the portfolio companies in line with IFCÔÇÖs policy requirements. 

The key risks associated with the FundÔÇÖs pipeline companies are related to occupational health and safety, resource efficiency, and pollution prevention. Activities in the food services sector could entail potential high level E&S risks and impacts related to harmful child labor and impacts on biodiversity. The Fund Manager has developed an ESMS and has ESDD procedures in place. The Fund Manager will be required to enhance its ESMS to ensure compliance of the investments made with the IFC Exclusion List, national E&S laws and regulations and the IFC Performance Standards, develop guidelines for the industry sectors the Fund will invest in and develop an external communications mechanism. IFC will review the first three ESDDs after commitment to support the implementation of the ESMS.

The project will be implemented on the ground by TechnoServe, and will entail agronomy and sustainability training to farmers and wet mill businesses and planting of shade trees. The scope of this project targets farmers and wet mill businesses in the regions of Sidamo B (in Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples'' Region, SNNPR) and Sidama A (in Oromia Region) in Ethiopia, as well as in central and western Kenya. The agronomy and sustainability training will target 33,000 AAA farmers and 125 wet mill businesses in Ethiopia, and 10,000 AAA farmers and 60 wet mill businesses in Kenya. In addition, shade tree planting activities will also target farmers and wet mills in the same AAA areas who previously participated in TechnoServes training (as part of Gates or Nestlé-funded programs, totaling around 25,000 farmers and 20 wet mills). In Ethiopia, seedlings will be grown in government-owned nurseries, from where they will be transported to farmers and wet mill businesses for planting. In Kenya, seedlings will be grown in cooperative-owned nurseries. Founded in 1986 and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nestlé, a Swiss multinational food company, Nespresso is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland and markets at-home espresso and coffee machines and capsules, as well as single-origin and specialty coffees from coffee producers around the world. Nespressos AAA Sustainable Quality Program, launched in 2003, is the companys long-term commitment to working with farmers and coffee growing communities to promote a sustainable future. Currently, Nespresso sources 84% of its coffee from the AAA Program worldwide, and seeks to source 100% by 2020. As part of its sustainability goals, Nespresso has already planted over 600,000 trees and aims to plant several million trees in AAA coffee regions by 2020, which helps strengthen coffee farms resilience to climate change and ensures sustainable coffee production for the future.TechnoServe was established in 1968 as a nonprofit organization with the aim of working in the developing world to build competitive farms, businesses and industries through the linking of people to information, capital and markets. To date, TechnoServe has worked in more than 40 countries across Africa, Latin America and Asia with coffee as one of its major sectors and has reached more than 250,000 coffee farmers around the world. TechnoServe has been present in Ethiopia since 2007 and provided training programs to approximately 50,000 smallholder coffee farmers centered around approximately 100 wet mills. In Kenya, TechnoServe has provided training to 17,000 smallholder coffee farmers and 72 wet mills. Initially funded by The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and now Nestlé Nespresso, TechnoServe provides a farmer-training program (Coffee Farm College) to educate smallholder coffee farmers in sustainable agronomic practices to increase yields and business support to farmer cooperatives to establish or upgrade wet mills to improve coffee quality through the East Africa Coffee Initiative. Nespresso and TechnoServe have been working together in Ethiopia since 2013 and in Kenya since 2014 to implement and scale up the Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality Program. This involves TechnoServe delivering the Coffee Farm College training to smallholder coffee farmers and sustainability and quality training to coffee wet mill businesses (cooperatives and, in Ethiopia, private businesses as well) to improve the quality and sustainability of their coffee, which also includes a module around coffee shade tree planting. The goal is to reach by 2020 an estimated 300 wet mills (purchasing from approximately 250,000 smallholder farmers), and provide agronomy training to 50,000 farmers. Achieving AAA supplier status will enable wet mill businesses to access a new market of Nespresso AAA sales and it is expected that smallholder coffee farmers will have increased coffee incomes as a result of improved yields, quality and market access to Nespressos AAA supply-chain.Ethiopia, the single largest African coffee producer and the worlds fifth largest, is commonly considered as the birthplace of coffee. Around 95% of Ethiopias coffee is produced by an estimated 4 million smallholder farmers on plots with an average size of 0.5 hectare (the average farm size is less than 2 hectare), the majority of which live in the southwestern and southeastern parts of the country (regions of Jimma, Lekempti, Sidamo and Yirgacheffe). Smallholder farmers are typically grouped into producer cooperatives, which provide services to members including coffee processing (wet mill, sun drying area, and storage shed), credit and human and financial resources. Sidamo (named after the Sidama Zone in Southern Ethiopia) is one of Ethiopias most distinctive coffee origins and accounts for more than two-thirds of Ethiopias washed coffee output. Kenya is the second largest producer of washed Arabica coffee in Africa. About 55-60% of Kenyan coffee production comes from an estimated 570,000 smallholder farmers, while the remainder comes from large estates. Most coffee is grown in central and western Kenya, accounting for 70% of Kenyas coffee production. All smallholders process and market their coffee through cooperatives, where they are required by law to be members.The government policy does not allow private companies to operate wet mills to process coffee from smallholder farmers and instead these are operated by cooperatives. Both Ethiopia and Kenya account for a key component of Nespressos overall supply from Africa, from where coffee is exported to Nespressos facilities in Switzerland for roasting, packaging and distribution through the companys sales and marketing channels.","","","","IFCs environmental & social (E&S) appraisal took place on 2-5 November 2015, in Ethiopia as well as follow-up phone conversation and included the following: -Meetings with key TechnoServe staff, including the Ethiopia Coffee Initiative Regional Director and the Ethiopia Coffee Initiative Country Director in Addis Ababa; staff at Bokasso and Fero cooperatives located in Wonsho District (Sidama B zone, SNNPR Province); and Nespresso Coffee Sustainability Project Manager;-Site visit to the TechnoServe office in Addis Ababa; Bokasso and Fero cooperatives located in Wonsho District (Sidama B zone, SNNPR Province, 320 km south east of Addis Ababa);-Review of technical documents provided by TechnoServe, including the standards for sustainable coffee production and audit checklist, examples of sustainability standards scorecard, agronomy program and technical assistance, Coffee Farm College, TechnoServe employee handbook; Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality Program, Nespressos Tool for the Assessment of Sustainable Quality (2013), Nespresso AAA Shared Commitment (Version 1.0), Nespresso Ecolaboration Report 2009-2013, Nestlé Supplier Code (December 2013), Nestlé Employee Relations Policy (September 2010), and Nestlé Corporate Business Principles.IFCs appraisal also considered the findings and performance of two previous IFC projects involving TechnoServe in Ethiopia (#29228 and #35023) including implementation and effectiveness of the standards for sustainable coffee production. TechnoServe successfully completed the Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) agreed upon under the first project, thereby achieving compliance with national legal and regulatory requirements as well as with the IFC Performance Standards and committed itself to maintain and improve on its existing sustainability framework. TechnoServe maintained an excellent environmental and social performance under the second project. IFCs appraisal considered the environmental and social management plans for the project and gaps, if any, between these plans and IFC requirements. Where necessary, corrective measures, intended to close these gaps within a reasonable period of time, are summarized in the paragraphs that follow and in the agreed Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) disclosed in this review summary. Through implementation of these management plans and the ESAP, the project is expected to be designed and operated in accordance with Performance Standards objectives.","","","","","","","","","","","","This proposed investment is not anticipated to generate adverse E&S risks but any that do arise are likely to be site-specific, few in number, reversible and readily addressed through mitigation measures.

Together the Projects will operate on heavy fuel oil with an option to convert to natural gas. The Extension will be located adjacent to the Initial Project and within the permitted footprint of 2.99 ha, in the municipality of Rufisque West, therefore requiring no additional land. The closest residential area is the Darou Salum Azur district located 400 m to the East of the project area, and with an estimated population of 4,000 people.

The loan will be used to finance energy and resource efficiency and productivity improvement investments of SSL, and will as a co-benefit also bring about reductions in emissions to the air from SSLs boilers.The project will be IFCs fourth engagement with the company and will include;Financing of cost overruns in the installation of a new energy efficient boiler (namely boiler 8) which was in part supported by a previous IFC project (project # 33387). Installation is complete, trial runs are on-going, and the boiler is expected be fully operational by June 2016. Upgrade and renovation of an existing boiler (namely boiler 7) to have fluidized bed combustion and higher efficiency.  Rebuilt boiler 7 is expected to be operational by early 2019. Neutralization of alkaline process waste water. For the neutralization project, SSL considers two technologies; (i) use of the emissions from the flue gas desulphurization (FGD) of the new boiler; or (ii) use the emissions of the lime kiln. The tender for design will be completed by the end of 2016 and the project will be operational by the end of 2017. Condensate heat recovery project / resource efficiency projects. The condensate heat recovery project will facilitate greater power generation by SSL and reductions in process steam heating needs. Other efficiency projects include insulation of boiler channels, pipes, valves and some water tanks, elimination of air leakages, replacement of low efficient motors, and installation of variable speed drivers.The boiler investments will be specified to meet contemporary air emissions regulations in Bosnia Hercegovina which are aligned with the World Bank Groups (WBG) Thermal Power Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Guideline guidance values in degraded airsheds, and represent a major reduction in emissions to air of particulate matter and sulphur oxides (SOx). The new and refurbished boilers are also expected to achieve more complete combustion of coal than is currently the case.  This will have dual benefits of reducing coal use by around 11%, and also allow fly ash to be sold to a local cement company for use in blended cement. Currently, the high carbon content of ash prevents this.","","","","The scope of review for this project included assessment of the companys environmental, health and safety and social (E&S) management capacity and performance in relation to IFCs Performance Standards, national regulatory requirements and the relevant World Bank Groups (WBG) Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines. The review relied on documents and reports made available by SSL and observation and interviews by IFC staff during a site visit conducted on March 15th and 16th, 2016. Interviews were held with SSLs key staff including the CFO; quality, health and safety manager, human resources manager; companys legal counsel and administration officers. During the visit, the companys existing production facility, the process waste disposal area (the white sea, and ash disposal area (black sea), water discharge points from both, and downstream and upstream part of the river Spreca and recently acquired land for the neutralization project were visited. IFC currently has multiple projects with Sisecam group companies including a Eurobond at the holding level, issued in 2013 (project # 33711, disclosed on October 31, 2013). With SSL, IFC has one closed (project # 25557, disclosed on January 16, 2007) and two active (project # 29692 and # 33387, disclosed on May 28, 2010 and May 7, 2013 respectively), and has made frequent supervision visits during the time of these investments.SSLs environmental and social (E&S) performance has improved considerably under Sisecams ownership and during the life of IFCs loans, though IFC has considered the companys environmental performance to be partly unsatisfactory due to the high air emissions and effluent conditions.

The Critical Habitat designation is triggered by the presence of significant concentrations of endangered, restricted range, migratory and congregatory species (mostly birds and some mammals). In addition, Critical Habitat is also triggered due to the presence of unique and highly threatened ecosystems in some of the farms. Several of AdecoAgro ARG's farms are also within or nearby internationally recognized areas for biodiversity.  These include, Important Bird Areas designated by BirdLife International and Key Biodiversity Areas, designated by Conservation International. Given the globally recognized value of these areas, the extent of past transformation and current agricultural activities, the impacts are potentially diverse and significant. Some project areas may overlap with unique and threatened vegetation communities thereby impacting other critical habitat areas.   The appraisal for this assessment confirmed that there are no impacts related to PS 5  Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement as AdecoAgro ARG's transactions entail acquisition of existing, large scale farms involving neither physical nor economic displacement.  There are no impacts related to PS 7  Indigenous Peoples as none of the operations are located in areas that would impact communities of Indigenous Peoples and there are no impacts related to PS 8  Cultural Heritage given the location of the existing farms.

Under GTSF, IFC provides short-term financing to suppliers (Suppliers) in emerging markets selling to large companies (Buyers) on open account terms.  In 2012 IFC provided Controladora Comercial Mexicana (Comerci), the fourth largest retailer in Mexico, with a GTSF-line of $30 million (Project # 31999).  However, 70% of Comerci was acquired by Soriana (or the company) (the second largest retailer in Mexico) and Soriana intend to continue Comercis existing GTSF line whereby this will be split into two i.e., $10 million will be retained by Comerci, and $20 million will be acquired and used by Soriana. IFC previously assessed the GTSF line for Comerci and this project was disclosed on 17 February 2012.  Thus this Environmental and Social Review Summary document focuses specifically on Soriana and the provision of the $20 million GTSF line to this company.  Under this project, IFC will provide financing to Sorianas suppliers based primarily in Mexico to support them in providing goods or services to the stores that were formerly owned by Comerci. The project is expected to reach 700 Suppliers, the large majority of which will be SMEs.","","","","In supplier financing programs of this nature, IFCs due diligence approach is to assess environmental and social (E&S) risks at supplier level by reviewing buyers management system and procedures, especially as related to managing E&S performance of their Suppliers.This GTSF line is proposed in the context of Sorianas acquisition of a group of stores owned by Comerci who is an existing GTSF Client. Therefore this ESRS is linked to and based on the initial assessment of Comerci which was  disclosed in 2012 and is available here: ifcextapps.ifc.org/ifcext/spiwebsite1.nsf/78e3b305216fcdba85257a8b0075079d/4c4471cbb46174dc852579a7006c4a30?opendocumentIFCs due diligence was performed at two levels, first by evaluating the current application of E&S policies in the existing GTSF program with Comerci and second a review of information regarding procurement practices from Soriana. The evaluation of Soriana included the review of publicly available information such as its code of ethics, the suppliers portal, the 2014 Sustainability and Social Responsibility report; and a telephonic discussion with Sorianas treasury team, who is responsible for the GTSF program.","","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Policy on Environmental and Social Sustainability because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result that can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.The environmental and social impacts that are expected to occur among Sorianas suppliers are those related primarily to production, manufacturing and distribution of food products (both processed and raw products), household goods, health and beauty products, and apparel items among others. Production of raw material, depending on the foodstuff, and the size and characteristics of the farm, commonly involves issues of labor and working conditions, pollution from fertilizers and pesticides, and management of agricultural waste. Food processing and household goods manufacturing may also involve issues pertaining to labor and working conditions including occupational health and safety, pollution prevention and resource management. A key issue for food production and distribution is also food safety, including traceability.Comercis supplier systems, which will be adapted and used by Soriana consider potential impacts of the suppliers in the aspects related to PS1 (Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts) and PS2 (Labor and working conditions); some elements of PS3 (Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention) are considered in the evaluation process. The suppliers to be financed within this Project are all existing companies. Since no greenfield companies will be financed, the impacts related to PS5 (Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement); PS6 (Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Natural Resource Management), PS7 (Indigenous Peoples), and PS8 (Cultural Heritage) are not expected. Suppliers impacts are limited mostly to their premises and no impacts to local communities are expected, therefore PS4 (Community Health, Safety and Security) issues are not expected.","","","","",37664,"","Q-BA - Retail (Including Supermarkets, Grocery Stores, etc.)","","","",""

Currently, FCEL is operating its pulping, fruits and vegetables (F&V) packing, frozen F&V, spice grinding and packing, and frozen snacks. Also, two of the joint venture (JV) companies are operating within the food park manufacturing sauces and rice flour. FCELs own flour and rice mills are under construction at the food park. Few of the plots have already been leased to external companies and construction is yet to start on these plots. Associated facilities provided at the food park includes cold rooms, warehouses, grain silos, grid power, water supply, water treatment plant (WTP), effluent treatment plant (ETP), fire hydrant system, roads and office space for temporary use.Agri-product sourcing: FCEL has presence in sourcing of agriculture commodities and fresh produce (like fruits and vegetables, staples (rice, wheat, sugar) spices, oils), estimated at over 100,000 tons from around 51 collection centers (sourcing hubs) across India.

Vorotan Debt,Investment,Environmental Documents,Active,Europe and Central Asia,Armenia,CONTOURGLOBAL HYDRO CASCADE CJSC,Regional Industry - INF ECA,2016-06-24T04:00:00Z,"",B,Other,"The proposed project involves a US$150 million debt financing package for ContourGlobal Hydro Cascade CJSC (the company, an existing IFC investee) in Armenia. This will include a proposed IFC A Loan and mobilization through an IFC B Loan and/or parallel loans. The company owns and operates the 404 MW Vorotan hydropower cascade, located roughly 255 km south east of Yerevan in Armenias southern Syunik Province. In July 2015, the company acquired these assets from the Government of Armenia (GoA) with IFC taking a 19.7% equity stake in the company (project #33450, board approved April 2014). ContourGlobal L.P. (CG or the sponsor) owns the remaining 80.3 % of the cascade company. The purpose of IFCs previous investment was to support the acquisition of the cascade from GoA as well as a major electro-mechanical rehabilitation program required as a condition of the privatization process. The use of proceeds for this proposed debt financing is to allow the company to make an outstanding 50 % payment to GoA for the assets, to pay off bridge loans and to make a distribution to shareholders. No significant construction work is anticipated and the required electro-mechanical works to which the original investment was targeted will have few environmental and social (E&S) impacts, most of which will be positive.The 404 MW Vorotan cascade extends 178 km along the Vorotan River and its tributaries and consists of three Soviet era hydropower plants (HPPs) and five reservoirs with a combined hydraulic head of 1223 m. The cascade contributes around 17 % of national power generation and, by virtue of a system of daily, monthly and seasonal reservoirs, supplies both base and peak load generation capabilities, providing an important grid stabilization function. The upper two HPPs are typically used for peaking purposes, whilst the lower HPP is used for baseload generation and grid stabilization. Construction of the first elements of the cascade began in the early 1960s, starting at the downstream end, and culminating in the start of commercial operations at the upstream end (Spandaryan) in 1989. The various HPPs have been operated reliably for between 26 - 45 years to date. The combined units have generated an average of 1135 GWh per annum over the past decade, with an overall capacity factor of ± 32 %. The cascade is made up of the following key infrastructure, in order of up- to downstream position:Spandaryan reservoir and dam comprises of an embankment type dam of 83 m in height, a large multi-seasonal storage reservoir of 257 million m3, 8.1 km of pressure tunnels and the 76 MW Spandaryan Hydropower Plant (HPP). The uppermost and most recently added component of the cascade, this HPP has two generating units and began commercial operations in 1989. The reservoir is located at an altitude of 1609 meters and acts as the main storage for the cascade, accumulating water during spring and early summer to allow for releases during the rest of the year. The reservoir is drawn down to minimum level in winter and the HPP units are shut down from March to May-June until the reservoir is filled to maximum supply level. Water from the Spandaryan HPP discharges into the Angeghakot reservoir.Located below the Spandaryan HPP are two monthly/seasonal storage reservoirs with a combined total capacity of 96 million m3, namely Angeghakot reservoir (with a 23.4 m concrete spillway dam) and Tolors reservoir (with a 79 m embankment type dam). Water discharges from Spandaryan HPP into Angeghakot reservoir and then onward through a 10.5 km transfer tunnel to Tolors reservoir, which also impounds water both from the Sisian River and another tributary. Water from the Tolors reservoir is directed downstream to the Shamb HPP via a 6.9 km high pressure tunnel and a 1.26 km penstock. The 171 MW Shamb HPP began operations in 1978, has two generating units and is located at the upper end of Shamb Reservoir. This penultimate reservoir in the cascade has a total volume of 13.6 million m3 and a dam height of 70 m.An 18 km non-pressurized tunnel joins the Shamb Reservoir with a much smaller Daily Regulation Reservoir/Pond, a concrete tank with a capacity of 85,000 m3 which represents the fifth and final reservoir in the cascade and acts as a regulating forebay for Tatev HPP. A 1.9 km steel penstock leads from this structure steeply down to the 157.2 MW Tatev HPP, the lowest and final stage of the cascade, located at an elevation of 730 m. Tatev HPP, which has been in commercial operation since December 1970, operates its three units near continuously and represents an important baseload generation plant for Armenia. The power plants are connected by long-established 220 kV transmission lines to the main Shinuhayr substation near Goris, except for Tatev which is connected by a 110 kV transmission line. Although few records exist with respect to minimum flow releases during the past decade of cascade operations, the consensus from regulators, operators and others seems to be that ± 10 % of the Vorotans natural flow is continually released along the rivers original course, with the rest being diverted into the power cascade. Actual flows in these bypassed river reaches are reportedly reasonably high in many parts of the river due to the ingress of a series of tributaries along the length of the cascade and the effects of winter snow melt. The current flow regimes have been in place for several decades and will not be altered by the proposed project.  Terrain in the project area is mountainous and relatively sparsely populated, though there are a number of towns, villages and homesteads spread along the length and breadth of the cascade. The largest of these are the towns of Sisian (population approx. 13,000), which is located on the banks of the Vorotan River in the upper section of the cascade, and Goris (population approx. 23,000), which is located a few km north of the river near the base of the cascade and is where the company has its offices. Other, smaller settlements spread across the cascade include Gorhayk, Tsghuk, Sarnakunq, Angeghakot, Shaqe, Shaghat, Balak, Tolors, Ahotavan, Uyts, Shamb, Ltsen, Tate and Khot. There is reportedly minimal use of cascade reservoirs for social or tourism purposes such as fishing, boating or rafting, as access is generally prohibited by law. Planned releases are made in late spring and early summer from Shamb reservoir for irrigation purposes, though volumes released are inconsequential with respect to power generation needs. As long-standing flow regimes will not be altered, no impacts on local inhabitants have been identified from the project besides those associated with potential changes to employment and the companys corporate social responsibility program (described further below).","","","","IFC reviewed technical, environmental and social (E&S) due diligence documents disclosed along with the previous Vorotan Hydros investment (project # 33450, disclosed February 10, 2014):ifcextapps.ifc.org/ifcext/spiwebsite1.nsf/78e3b305216fcdba85257a8b0075079d/e79e83b2de03575485257c7b00755835?opendocumentas well as a series of updates and new studies prepared by the company in order to meet the E&S Action Plan (ESAP) agreed at that time. These supplemental studies include the following:Health & Safety Conditions Improvement Plan (Fichtner, November 2015);Dam and Civil Structures Survey & Monitoring Plan (Fichtner, December 2015);Updates of the original IFC ESAP disclosed in February 2014;Gap Analysis Report (comparing Armenian and IFC requirements, Fichtner November 2015);Environmental Liability Assessment Report (Fichtner, December 2015);Health & Safety Regulatory Compliance Assessment Report (Fichtner, December 2015);Hazardous Substances Assessment Report (Fichtner, December 2015);Final Stakeholder Engagement Plan (CG, May 2016). IFC conducted an appraisal mission to Armenia from February 9  12, 2016, which included meetings in Yerevan, Goris and at various site locations with key company and CG staff and management team members (e.g. the new company EHS Manager based in Goris, the CG Refurbishment Project Manager based in Bulgaria and CGs E&S Director based in Vienna). The trip and meetings were held together with a group of other potential parallel and B-lenders and with representatives of Sargent & Lundy, the appointed Lenders Technical Advisors. The appraisal mission also included site visits to two of the three HPPs and one of the larger reservoirs; and meetings with the Mayor of Goris and a group of 11 NGOs active in the projects area of influence. A conference call was held with Cascade Consultants, the companys Human Resources (HR) management consultants based in Yerevan.IFC also reviewed the performance of the Vorotan Hydros equity investment and two other active IFC investments in CG, i.e. two thermal power plants in West Africa: CG Togo (project #27849, board approved December 2009) and CG Cap des Biches in Senegal (project #35175, board approved June 2015). IFC supervision records indicate that both the Vorotan Hydros and CG Togo projects currently have a Satisfactory environmental and social risk rating, whilst the project in Senegal is in its first year of supervision and has not yet been rated. Despite the relative proximity of the project area to the disputed territory of Nagorno Karabakh - the border of which is approximately 30 km north east of the town of Goris, located near the base of the cascade - no elevated security risk to staff or local communities was identified and no significant security incidents have been reported during the past two decades of cascade operations.","","","","","","","","","","","","As discussed above, the proceeds of this proposed investment will be directed to acquisition of an operating hydropower cascade and refinancing of bridge loans. The investment activities will be within the existing E&S footprint and will generally help improve the availability and efficiency of renewable power generation. As such there are expected to be limited E&S risks and impacts associated with the investment, most of which will be related to forthcoming electro-mechanical rehabilitation of certain existing assets. Certain legacy impacts will be addressed, for example long worker shifts and poor waste management and occupational health & safety (OHS) practices. Other key issues include proposed improvements in dam safety monitoring and mitigation, likely future reduction of the permanent workforce, the establishment of adequate company E&S and OHS capacity and management systems, and roll out of a new stakeholder engagement program. All considered, the project is categorized B because a limited number of adverse E&S impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized standards, guidelines or design criteria.","","","","",37652,"",V-BA - Large Hydro - Renewable Energy Generation,"","","",""

The rating acknowledged that many of the ESAP conditions from the existing loan remained open, though were in process of being closed. In June 2013, a worker incident occurred at Bioparques. Bioparques was accused by a group of nearly 300 workers of being held in forced labor conditions. The investigation uncovered that a broker (representing Bioparques) had recruited these workers to the company, had them living in company owned housing, but never paid them the wages they had worked, at the rate they had negotiated. Bioparques management was unaware that this had occurred and was ultimately found guilty by the courts and fined for use of negligent practices. The worker incident led to the arrests of two Bioparques staff. The project received negative media coverage around the event that led to Bioparques losing some strategic commercial partners and also brought IFC into scrutiny for its involvement with the Company. The incident highlighted important gaps in Bioparques labor practices and an urgent need for a review and improvement of its human resources (HR) management system (HRMS), which at the time, was not in alignment with IFCs PS 2 requirements.The company recognizes that the growth and success of its business is correlated with proper management of its workforce, the majority of which is migratory due to the remote location of the operation. After nearly three years of improving its labor procedures and practices with the help of an externally commissioned international labor expert, Bioparques has a significantly improved (integrated) human resources management system compared to what it had previously before the incident. Bioparques will continue to work with the labor experts developing all outstanding elements of an integrated HRMS, and refining its implementation to ensure it captures all risks that need to be managed. Additionally, Bioparques is voluntarily seeking certification against Social Accountability Internationals (SAI) SA 8000 labor standard in early 2017. Certification includes occupational health and safety (OHS) practices, which the client is also in process of improving. Certification against the standard will assess and check the companys good practice in these areas overtime, as will IFC in its routine and periodic supervision visits. Details on the status of improvements on both labor and OHS matters are discussed in detail under PS 2 Labor and Working Conditions. Commentary on PS1 and PS 3 provide details on the clients performance on environmental management issues, and the ESAP highlights actions to be implemented across the board in order to fully align with IFCs PS requirements. Additional details around Bioparques practices in labor and working conditions are provided in the commentary under sections on PS1 and PS2. Commentary on PS1 and PS 3 provide details on the clients performance on environmental management issues, and the ESAP highlights actions to be implemented in order to fully align with IFCs PS requirements. The scope of the new appraisal included: (i) a desktop review of Bioparques environmental and social management system (ESMS), (ii) on-site visits to the location of the proposed project, the housing complexes (worker accommodation) as well as to each of the four existing production and operation sites, packaging and logistical facilities; and finally (iii) interviews and discussions with key operational, environmental, social, health and safety personnel, both at the corporate and site levels.","","","","","","","","","","","","As highlighted under Overview of IFCs Scope of Review, Bioparques continues to work with the labor experts on improving its management of labor issues, in accordance to IFCs PS 2 requirements. IFC notes a marked improvement in Bioparques practices in this area, compared to before. The company also continues to progress with its review of OHS practices to closer align with PS2 and SA 8000 requirements. IFC will continue to closely monitor performance and progress in this area by carrying out periodic supervision visits to the project, and through the annual monitoring review and reporting process.The third loan will shift IFCs focus from strengthening the clients management of social and labor issues to improving its EHS standards and management system (EHSMS), which IFC identified as requiring improvement in order to close the gaps that remain open. This is a category B project according to IFCs Sustainability Policy because of the limited number of specific environmental and social impacts that may result from the projects construction and operations, all of which can be mitigated, managed or controlled with the application of sector specific good international industry practice (GIIP) and corrective measures and practices identified in the applicable Performance Standards and the World Bank (WB) General Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines.The key potential environmental and social risks and impacts associated with the construction of the new facilities include: - following proper identification of environmental and social risks and impacts; - proactive onsite management and application of appropriate mitigation measures; - contractor management; - recruitment of local workers; - occupational health and safety of workers during construction and operations; proper drainage, erosion and sedimentation control of land during construction and operations; - waste and effluent management during construction and operations; - quality control and use of pesticides and fertilizers during operations; and community health, safety and security during construction works.","","","","",37826,"",A-AF - Fruits and Vegetables,"","","",""

The project will substitute Hussein Thermal Power Station, one of the oldest and most inefficient Heavy fuel oil (HFO)fired power plants in Jordan which was decommissioned in December 2015, with a more efficient power plant. The proposed project is expected to cost approximately US$475 million and the proposed IFC investment consists of an A-loan of up to US$75 million. The project is being developed by ACWA Power (the sponsor), through its subsidiary in Jordan Mahatat Al Zarqa Le Tawleed Al Takah Al Kahrabaieyaha (the company). EBRD is considering co-financing this project.The project will be constructed on about 14.9 ha of a mostly undeveloped area of the decommissioned power plant site, which is located within the City of Zarqa Industrial Zone. Despite being in an industrial zone, within a radius of 1.75 km from the project site there are approximately 350 residential structures in Al-Hashemiyeh-south including residential dwellings. The nearest residential receptor is located around 250 m north of the site and there is a National Electric Power Company (NEPCO) training center located 200 m away from the project site.  The land for the project was leased to the project company from the sponsors subsidiary Central Electricity Generating Company (CEGCO, an existing IFC client). Natural gas, the main fuel for the project, will be supplied by NEPCO, the government owned power transmission company and single buyer, via a new subsurface gas pipeline connection to Jordans main gas pipeline, which is located approximately 600 m from the project boundary. The project back-up fuel (low-sulphur light distillate fuel oil, or LDO) will be delivered by NEPCO to the site via an existing 1700 m long fuel oil pipeline from the adjacent petrochemical refinery. Process water for the power plant operation will be extracted from 3 new shallow boreholes (95 m  220 m) located within the project site. The Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) will supply the power plant with potable water (up to 2450 m3/week) via a new 800 m long water pipeline to be constructed by WAJ. The electricity generating efficiency of the power plant in combined cycle will be 49.6 % (net, LHV basis) or 51.2% (gross, LHV basis). The project company signed the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) agreement with Shandong Electric Power Construction Corporation III (SEPCO III), a subsidiary of Power Construction Corporation of China in January 2016.

Banking is the Group''s core business. The banking business consists of corporate investment banking, retail banking, as well as advisory and brokerage, insurance and leasing services. The Group primarily conducts its banking business through BOG and banking operations in Belarus through Belarusky Narodny Bank (BNB), both existing IFC clients (BOG projects - #30683, 34173, 36640; BNB projects - #28582, #34287). The Group also has an investment arm that comprises: (i) a healthcare business - Georgia Healthcare Group PLC; (ii) a real estate development business - M2 Real Estate, which is an existing IFC client (#35845); and (iii) a renewable energy business - Georgia Renewable Power Company that invests in small and medium size hydropower plants. In addition, in 2016 BGEO acquired an additional 75% stake in Georgian Global Utilities (GGU) taking the overall stake held by BGEO Group PLC in GGU to 100%.  GGU supplies water and provides waste water treatment services in Tbilisi, Mtskheta and Rustavi; as well as operates hydropower generation facilities for its own power supply needs and sale to third parties. The Group''s other investments include Teliani Valley, a wine and beverage business.Of the approximately US$346.8 million in net proceeds from the issue of New Notes, up to US$250 million will be funded to BOG by way of senior debt and applied to fund the acquisition of 2017 Notes by BOG as part a tender offer and exit consent solicitation which was announced on 30 June 2016.  Up to US$100 million will be retained by JSC BGEO and used for its general corporate purposes, including funding existing investments and opportunistic acquisitions.IFCs investment in the New Notes would constitute a fraction of the intended debt funding of BOG from the proceeds of the New Notes.  BOG''s existing portfolio includes limited exposure to business activities with potential significant adverse environmental and/or social impacts. It is expected that the E&S risk profile of the prospective portfolio will be very similar. The project has therefore been categorized as FI-2 in accordance with IFCs Sustainability Framework. BOG will be required to comply with the IFC Exclusion List, national E&S laws and the IFCs Performance Standards.","","The main E&S risks and impacts of this proposed project derive from BOGs banking activities, as well as BOGs capacity to manage these risks. BOG, representing the core of the Group''s banking business, is an existing IFC client and such has met IFCs E&S requirements set by previous projects including implementing an Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) and assigning an ESMS officer to manage the E&S risks. BOGs current E&S risk management is considered as overall satisfactory. BOG is found to be generally in line with IFC Performance Standard 2 Labor and Working Conditions on its own HR management. BOG is required to: (i) continue to implement its ESMS satisfactory to IFC; (ii) provide staff training responsible for the ESMS implementation, and (iii) submit an Annual Environmental Report (AEPR) to IFC.","",Task Title & DescriptionAnticipated Completion Date,38541,"",O-AA - Commercial Banking - General,"",70.0 ,"",""

Anyou II,Investment,Environmental Documents,Completed,East Asia and the Pacific,China,"Anyou Biotechnology Group Co.,Ltd.",Regional Industry - MAS Asia & Pac,2016-08-16T04:00:00Z,"",B,Other,"IFC is considering a long-term local currency loan of around RMB250 million (US$40 million equivalent) to Anyou Biotechnology Group Co., Ltd. (Anyou or the Company), an existing client of IFC (Project # 31568). The loan will be applied to support Anyous capital expenditure and working capital needs for further expansion into frontier regions of China and to strengthen its balance sheet by replacing part of its short-term bank borrowing.Anyou produces a range of pig and fish feeds in more than 50 production facilities (mills) in 26 provinces in China. Anyou produced 885,000 T of feed in 2015, consisting of 95% pig feed and 5% fish feed. Feed is produced in powder, pellet and granular form depending upon the end use. Anyous stock feeds provide superior performance, coupled with strong research and development capability and holistic customer service that addresses feed formulation, livestock management, nutrition and animal health. Anyou owns an animal feed research institute, is an industry leader in piglet feed production, and has more than 20 patents for different types of animal feed. The Company currently employs 3,727 people.Piglet feed accounted for 88% in of the Companys revenue in 2015. Anyous piglet feeds have high palatability and high lactobacillus content, which can help newly weaned piglets get used to hard feed, reduce weaning stress and better absorb the nutrient content of feeds. For fattening pig feeds, Anyou focuses on low protein, ideal amino acid content and optimal energy consumption, which helps to improve the feed conversion ratio and reduce the production of animal waste (primarily manure and methane) by between 20-40%, contributing to a reduction in the overall environmental impact of pig raising farms.Anyous main customers are small to medium scale pig producers. In 2015 the company supplied around 5,000 pig farms with average sow numbers of between 500-600 sows, that raise a total of 65 million piglets per annum (averaging 21 piglets per sow per annum).The company has rapidly expanded its operations over the past eight years, increasing total production from 89,700 T in 2007 to 884,700 T in 2015. Anyou has the ultimate aim of reaching 3.0 million T production per annum. Production expansion is based on establishing mills close to the customer base to avoid transport costs and supply delays rather than increasing production at existing mills. Under the proposed investment Anyou plans to build new animal feed mills in a number of frontier Provinces and expand some existing feed mills, increasing total animal feed production capacity by around 800,000 tons per annum.Anyou also commenced raising breeding sows in late 2015, with the company currently running 13,500 sows on farms leased from growers who were Anyou pig feed customers. Anyou produces genetically improved piglets by using imported semen on most sow raising farms, then selling them to producers who privately run what Anyou terms scientific farms. Farms with at least 1,000 sow capacity and good quality facilities are leased for a period of 10 years. Anyou plans to expand this activity to 20,000 sows by the end of 2016 and eventually to 30,000 sows on 12 farms. Anyou also supports privately owned and operated scientific farms by bundling services with the supply of piglets. Services include extension advice on improved pig raising, disease prevention and farm management, and supplying veterinary products, while Anyou feed supply is promoted but not mandatory.IFCs investment will be a repeat investment (2013), helping to support the Companys expansion into frontier regions, creating a development benefit by reducing piglet mortality rates and improving frontier region farmers livelihoods. Anyous main products are compound feeds, premix feeds and concentrate feeds for pigs, with variations of each of these types of feed produced for different stages of animal life. For all feed categories Anyou has (i) weaning piglet series and (ii) fattening pig series. For premix and concentrate feeds, the Company also supplies breeding pig feed series. Feed is produced as either (i) a complete food, (ii) an additive to hard feed or, (iii) in the case of the piglet feed, mixed with water to produce milk-based liquid.The project will help reach more pig farmers in frontier regions, helping those farmers to reduce pig mortality rates. The project will create around 70-100 new positions per mill (for production, sales and logistics), equivalent to around 640-700 new jobs in total.Anyous feed mill processes typically consist of: testing, unloading and storage of raw materials; cleaning some raw materials; grinding grains and other materials; mixing; cooling and drying; bagging; storage; and loading. The main feed raw materials used are corn, wheat, rice, soybean meal, fish meal and whey, with additives such as amino acids and minerals used in small quantities. Raw materials are mostly obtained from larger reputable suppliers.Anyou builds its own mills rather than adapting existing building. A plant consists of a mill, warehouse, offices and a dormitory for staff (typically housing 30-50 staff), all located within a secure compound typically around 3 ha in size.The Company places high importance on product quality, undertaking the following measures to ensure that quality is maintained: testing raw materials upon arrival at the mill in the Companys on-site certified laboratory (China National Accreditation Service certified), and only accepting material once it has been cleared; computer automated material transport and mixing; and traceable product batch labelling with bar codes. One notable product quality measure is the importation of fish meal for pig feed from Peru to control the quality of this product even though it cost considerably more than locally-produced product that can have quality issues. Antibiotics are added to various feeds strictly in accordance with Government requirements set out in the Standard Usage of Medical Feed Additives (Announcement by the Ministry of Agriculture No.168, hereinafter referred to as Standard Usage). In addition, Anyous research centre is investigating substitutes for antibiotics, with natural products with medicinal properties (such as herbs) added to some feeds to substitute for antibiotics and improve animal health. No hormones are added to any feed mixes.","","","","IFCs review of the project consisted of appraising environmental and social (E&S) and technical information provided by Anyou, covering corporate-wide activities that include: plant siting and facilities; raw material quality; plant processes; product quality; and human resources (HR) and occupational health and safety (OHS) issues. IFC visited Anyous corporate headquarters in Taicang City, Jiangsu Province and operational feed mills (mills, warehouses, boilers and offices) in Taicang City and Nantong, Jiangsu Province, on 7-8 June 2016. Meetings were held with Anyous senior management, including the HR, procurement, and operations departments.IFC appraised Anyou project #31568 (2013), an equity investment in and loan to Anyou (China) Research of Animal Nutrition Company Limited, and the most recent IFC Annual Monitoring Report (AMR  8 December 2014) for the initial Anyou investment to assess the E&S performance of the company, which was rated as excellent.","","","","","","","","","","","","This investment is classified as a Category B project in accordance with IFCs Policy on Environment and Social Sustainability.

The fertilizers, crop nutrition programs and technologies increase yields, improve product quality and reduce the environmental impact of agricultural practices. Yara`s industrial and environmental solutions improve air quality by reducing emissions from industry and transportation, and serve as key ingredients in the production of a wide range of goods. The company is actively expanding its operations in emerging markets and has invited IFC to consider supporting its FY15 - 17 capital investment programs in Africa and Latin America which is expected to benefit a large number of farmers, including small and medium sized enterprises. The majority of Yaras production sites are in Europe, and the remaining production is in Australia, Columbia, Trinidad, Canada, Brazil and Libya. The most important production process in Yara is natural gas based ammonia synthesis. Other nitrogen fertilizers are downstream production from ammonia. Besides production, Yara also operates warehouse/blending facilities and distribution networks in both Europe, the United States and emerging markets. IFC is considering a corporate loan to Yara so as to support the establishment of warehouse/blending facilities in Africa and Latin America; this includes a recently acquired facility in Zambia.

This plant, located at approximately 20 km to the south of the city of Cruz del Eje, in the Province of Cordoba, produces hydrated lime. It has 4 vertical kilns with a 50 tons per day (tpd) capacity each and two hydrators. Two of the kilns operate with certified wood and the other two with pet coke. One of the hydrators has a capacity of 12 tph (tons per hour) and a much smaller hydrator with a capacity of 4 tph is operated in as needed basis depending on the market demand. The process includes (a) perforation, blasting, crushing, and screening during the extraction of the limestone; (b) calcination, crushing, grinding, hydration, during the production of the hydrated lime; and (c) packaging.  There is a community of approximately 200 people living in close proximity to the plant. Padre Bueno. This facility is located in the municipality of Cienaguita in the San Juan Province at approximately 130 km from Mendoza and 90 km from San Juan.  It comprises of Padre Bueno and Decavo plants, which are about 8 km afar. The area comprising both plants is Cefas property.The operations at the Padre Bueno plant include (a) perforation, blasting, crushing, and screening during the extraction of the limestone; (b) calcination, crushing, grinding, hydration, during the production of the hydrated lime; and (c) packaging. This plant has two mixed-fuel vertical kilns and a hydrator.  The 50 tpd vertical kilns operate with either pet coke or gas and the 500 tpd Maerz kiln operates with either gas or pet coke. The, approximately 400 people, Cienaguita community is located three kilometers to the South of the plant; the Divisadero community comprised of approximately 400 people is located 5 km from the plant; and the Pedernal and Berros communities are located at approximately 10 km and 15 km respectively from the plant. The Decavo plant is located at approximately 4 km from the Berros municipality and it is being out of operation for about 6 years. The Decavo plant will be dismantled as part of this project and its corresponding dismantlement plan including the EHS impacts and mitigations will be submitted to IFC as indicated in the ESAP. Olavarria. This plant, located in Olavarria in the Province of Buenos Aires, produces hydrated lime.  It has six vertical kilns, each with a 40tpd capacity, which use pet coke as fuel and a hydrator. It extracts its lime rock from the company-owned Don Antonio quarry located at approximately 18 km from the Olavarria community and close to the plant. The process includes crushing, hydration, grinding, and packaging.  This is the only plant that has an automatic palletizer. The closest communities, Sierras Bayas and Villa Fortabat with approximately 4000 people each, are located approximately 8 km from the plant. Zapala. This plant, located in Zapala, Province of Neuquen, produces 1,800 ton/month of gypsum for agricultural use. It extracts the dolomite from its own 52-ha quarry which is located 30 km away from the plant in the city of Covunco. As the quarry operation is subcontracted, it does not have explosives storage on premises.

The contracts include supply, erection and commissioning ('E&C') of wind turbines and solar panels. The SPVs also sign a comprehensive operation and maintenance (O&M) contract with these technology suppliers for long term operations/maintenance services.

The review relied on documents made available by Amata Hotels such as design plans, Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) reports for the proposed project, human resources (HR) policies and manuals, environmental, health and safety (EHS) monitoring data for its operational facilities, design specifications and drawings for the proposed developments under the project; etc.; and interviews conducted by IFC staff and consultants during site visits to the companys operational hotels in Bagan and Inle Lake as well as at the companys headquarters in Yangon.

Moreover, to understand the E&S issues and risks associated with tourism development in Inle Lake area, IFC staff and consultants met with several local stakeholders active in the tourism sector and environmental conservation in the area.  The organizations met with during the due diligence include: Biodiversity and Nature Conservation Association (BANCA), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Myanmar office, MCRB, Myanmar Forest Association, MIID, Partnership for Change  Inle Speaks and Nature and Wildlife Conservation Division of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation among others. The risks present at Inle Lake are primarily related to impacts on the lakes biodiversity. Inle Lake is designated as Myanmars first Biosphere Reserve under UNESCOs Man and the Biosphere (MAB) program- due to economic activity and floating gardens on the lake, and are described in detail under the PS6 section of this review summary. With over three thousand Buddhist temples, monasteries, stupas and monuments compacted into one area, Bagan is home to the highest density of Buddhist architecture anywhere in the world. This very important and unique cultural heritage site also presents its own set of risks and issues for tourism development in the area, which is seeking designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. These have been discussed under the PS8 section of this review summary.","","","","","","","","","","","","The key issue associated with this projects relates to UIGs corporate capacity, management systems and performance to date in managing environmental and social risks.  These risks are of  two types:  risks associated with any hospitality development which include: life and fire safety, managed through adoption of an internationally recognized design code and operations; efficiency of raw material, water and energy use in hotel design and operations; emissions and waste management and disposal; labor and working conditions; and management of contractors and suppliers (during construction and operational phases), and risks deriving from the projects location including cumulative and project-related impacts on critical habitat and  biodiversity in the Inle Lake area; and on cultural heritage in Bagan area and finally the engagement with local communities, government agencies, civil society organizations and peers in tourism industry. The Project has a limited number of potentially adverse E&S impacts, which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines, or design criteria.

The grain terminal will have capacity of 5 million tonnes of grain per year (the terminal) and Berth No.25 (the berth) will be capable of handling vessels up to 100,000 tonnes deadweight tonnage (DWT). MV Cargo is owned by the co-owners of Trans Investment Service Group (TIS Group), the largest Ukrainian port complex. The grain terminal facilities will be developed by MV Cargo and upon completion of the project facilities Cargill Inc., a leading global agriculture commodities producer and trader, is expected to purchase 51% of stake of the company and become a major user and operate the terminal and berth. Following the agreement signed with MV Cargo in March 2016, the Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority (the Authority), a state enterprise responsible for supervising development, operation, and maintenance of the Ukrainian seaports and their infrastructure, will support the terminal development by designing, implementing and monitoring the necessary dredging works up to 16 meter depth for the connection of the berth to the inner channel of the Port of Yuzhny. The terminal and the berth will be developed in two phases. IFCs proposed investment (the project) consists of the first phase of the terminal and berth development. The first phase of the terminal development primarily entails construction of: (i) rail intake facilities with a capacity of 4 million tonnes of grain per year (two unloading points for two wagons each); (ii) truck intake facilities (six unloading points for trucks including trailer by means of truck tipplers), (iii) one unloading point suitable for (back) unloading trucks / tipping cars; truck buffer area, (iv) grain storage facilities (14 silos and one flat storage with capacity of 210,000 tonnes, one flat storage with 36,000 tonne capacity for multi-grain storage or 80,000 tonne capacity for single grain storage); (v) a grain cleaning and drying unit with capacity 150 tonnes per hour, (vi) a transport network of elevators and conveyors, (vii) a ship loader for loading of bulk grain on ships with a capacity of 2000 tonnes per hour; and (viii) off-site utilities (power supply, gas supply, potable water supply, sewage collection and pre-treatment, storm water collection, fire water network, security systems, communication networks). The first phase development of the berth will encompass construction of a 422 m berth in length on reclaimed land with one rail-mounted movable ship loader with capacity of 2,000 tonnes per hour and depth of up to 15 meters. The project will be connected to the rail station Khimicheskaya located in the Port of Yuzhny and operated by TIS Group. The second phase of the terminal development includes facilities for liquid bulk, additional flat storage and a second ship loader that will increase annual capacity of the facility to 6  8 million tonnes of grain.  The project will be constructed by direct contracting of services, works and equipment supply and installation. MV Cargo contracted TIS Gidrotekhnika as the project general contractor for the berth and terminal construction in June 2016. To date approximately 300,000 cubic meters of fill material has already been placed as part of required reclamation for the berth. It is expected that the project will become operational within two years from commencement of construction.The project required acquisition of 11 land plots of total acreage of 28.01 ha. The company purchased nine of these land plots from its three private owners at market rates on a willing-buyer, willing-seller basis and two plots were acquired from the State Administration of Odessa region under long-term (49 years) lease agreements signed in March 2010 and September 2011.IFC is considering an A Loan of up to $37 million to finance the project.

It is a subsidiary of China Post Group Corporation (CPGC).  As of March 31, 2016, PSBC had a total of 40,057 business outlets covering all cities in China and 98.9% of the county areas, and had a retail client base of 505 million.  Leveraging its large network and broad coverage in urban and county areas in China, PSBC strategically focuses on providing financial services to communities, SMEs and Agriculture/ Rural/ Farmers (ARF, or Sannong) customers and are committed to meeting the financial needs of its customers.PSBC launched a pre-IPO private placement and offered approximately16.92% ownership stake through the issuance of new shares to a shortlist of international and domestic strategic investors, including IFC. This investment is consistent with IFCs strategy for East Asia and China is a key market in achieving the WBG goal of universal financial access by 2020.  China accounts for approximately 16% or almost 400 million people of the worlds 2.5 billion unbanked population.  The investment in PSBC can play a critical and strategic role in expanding financial inclusion in China as it has one of the most extensive bank networks in the world and is also the leading bank in China for SME and rural finance. The partnership is a unique opportunity for IFC to reinforce and significantly expand its mandate of financial inclusion and poverty alleviation in China, given the aligned mandate between PSBC and IFC on financial inclusion, the unique broad outreach in frontier regions, and the potential growth of the institution.","","","IFC and PSBC entered into a Strategic Cooperation Agreement which identified the areas in which IFC will provide advisory services. Based on discussions with PSBC and IFC's strong track record of providing integrated investment and advisory services, PSBC would look to IFC to, where applicable and practical, cooperate in the area of rural finance, offer advisory services, conduct mapping of the relevant products and services and processes, and provide suggestions of improvement compared to international best practices, and to leverage IFC's diagnostic and analytical tools to improve corporate governance mechanism.","","","1.	Promote access to finance for MSMEs and rural sector. IFC believes its participation in this project will facilitate access to finance for a large segment of the MSME market which is currently under served. Greater financial inclusion is a strategic priority for IFC in China and this project fits well into that overall objective. As stated above, the development impact of the project is significant and will help change the landscape of MSME/ rural finance in China. Nowadays, a number of policy banks, microfinance institutions, rural credit cooperatives and village and township banks are serving the MSME/ rural sector but none of them can compare to a large and professionally-operated commercial bank with the right mandate and mission, with the most in-depth outreach and strong capital position, and with globally first-class sponsors.2.	Create jobs, alleviate poverty and boost shared prosperity. In China, MSMEs create 50% of GDP, 60% of tax but 70% of jobs and 80% of innovation; therefore an active MSME segment is critical to maintain employment. In the meantime, due to the unbalanced development between urban and rural areas in China, the poverty mostly lies on farmers. The support to MSMEs and rural sector is equivalent will lead to job creation and poverty alleviation in China.3.	Promote best practice in banking and governance. As a State-Owned commercial bank, with long history of operating under administrative interventions, PSBC needs to enhance its banking expertise and adopt a more robust governance structure. IFC could bring its global expertise and experience in commercial banking to PSBC; furthermore, IFC''s potential nominee director can also play a major role in introducing international best practice at the Board level.4.	Promote SOE equity reform, aiming for a more balanced shareholding structure, a market-oriented business model and higher operation efficiency. IFC''s catalytic role in bringing diversified investors will contribute to the ongoing overall SOE reforms in China; in addition, IFC''s extensive experience in privatization could serve as a useful reference to PSBC.","","","1.	Stamp of approval: IFC''s investment will be regarded as a stamp of approval of the Bank, the country and Chinese banking industry from long-term perspective. Given the widely spread concerns on China economic downturn and the increasing risks in the Chinese banking industry, IFC''s stamp of approval will provide additional comfort for foreign institutions to invest in the Bank.<br><br>2.	Honest broker: IFC''s investment is seen by the Government and CPGC as ""critical seed"" to provide comfort to other strategic investors. For the upcoming equity reform of PSBC, a large majority state-owned bank, the Government/ CPGC and the strategic investors do value the honest broker investor who plays a bridging and balanced role, especially in the case of PSBC, where some potential investors are likely to be competitors globally.<br><br>3.	Integrated IS-AS: PSBC welcomes IFC''s value proposition through combined investment and advisory services. They have expressed keen desire for capacity building, particular in the areas of MSME finance, mobile banking and risk management. <br><br>4.	Relationship with and influence on the government: China''s new state leadership has recently promoted a transformational initiative to encourage State-Owned Enterprises (""SOEs"") to open to private capital and to diversify ownership structure. PSBC''s equity reform is supporting this critical initiative. IFC, as a committed and long-term investor focusing on poverty alleviation, could leverage its relationship with and influence on the government to assist the Bank in achieving a smooth and successful equity reform.<br><br>5. Aligned mission in financial inclusion: The aligned mission in supporting financial inclusion will provide synergy for both parties to work together.","","","PSBC is a new client.

Aneka Gas products have a myriad of applications and serve a diverse range of industries including healthcare, agribusiness, consumer goods, metallurgy, energy, infrastructure and others. The Company is currently undertaking an initial public offering (IPO) on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. Proceeds from the IPO would allow Aneka Gas to expand and refurbish existing production and distribution operations, repay debt, reduce overall leverage, and fund additional working capital required to support continued growth of the business (the Project). The IPO would also support the Companys continued nationwide expansion and promote economic development in frontier regions.","","","","",[Covered in the ESRS],"Supporting key economic sectors: IFC''s investment in Aneka Gas will support the growth of the Company''s clients in key sectors including healthcare, agribusiness, consumer goods, manufacturing and infrastructure.Frontier regions: By supporting the largest industrial gas company in Indonesia, and the only one with a nationwide distribution network, IFC''s investment will also support economic development in the frontier regions that Aneka Gas serves, including the islands of Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and West Nusa Tenggara.Capital markets development: As an investor in the Company''s IPO, IFC will support the Government of Indonesia''s efforts to expand the country''s public equity market.Job creation: The expansion of Aneka Gas'' production capacity and distribution network will directly create new employment opportunities. Additional indirect jobs will also be generated through the growth of the Company''s associated supply chain.Adoption of IFC Performance Standards: Aneka Gas will be required to formally reference IFC''s Performance Standards in their EHS policy document and align their activities with the associated requirements. As a result, it is anticapted that other industry players in the broader sector will also raise standards. This will send a signal to the market that this can be achieved on a commercially sustainable basis and thus serve as a catalyst for other firms to make improvements in areas such as labor conditions, safety, efficient use of resources and environmental sustainability.","","","ADDITIONALITY<br>Positive signal to the market: IFC''s participation in the Company''s IPO will provide the credibility of an internationally recognized and well-respected investor. It is expected to send a positive signal to the market and support Aneka Gas in attracting other high-quality investors as long-term shareholders in the Company.<br><br>Long Term Capital: IFC will provide patient equity financing, to help Aneka Gas'' expansion plans. The equity infusion will also help strengthen the Company''s balance sheet. <br><br>Global Knowledge and Industry Relationships: The Company will benefit from IFC''s global chemicals sector experience and network, as it seeks to increase its range of product offerings.<br><br>Environmental and Social Performance Standards: Alignment with IFC''s Environmental and Social (E&S) standards will ensure the Company''s associated practices are enhanced to align with recognized and accepted best practices in this sector.<br><br>Corporate governance:  Engagement with IFC will assist the Company in elevating corporate governance standards to a level above local requirements.","","","The Company is owned by the privately-held Samator Group (the Sponsor) of Indonesia.

The loan(s) would support the construction, operation and maintenance of three adjacent 50 MW (TBCCPL A, B & C total 150 MW) greenfield wind farms. The project site is in the Jhimpir Wind Corridor, Thatta District of Sindh Province in Pakistan, between Karachi and Hyderabad, approximately 50 km from Karachi and 100 km inland from the coast.The project will install a total of 87 wind turbine generators (WTG) (29 at each sub-project). Each turbine will have a generating capacity of 1.7 MW and will require about 2.5 acres of land. Government of Sindh leased 1284acres (500 ha) of land to each TBCCPL 50 MW wind power plant. For all the three sub-projects (150 MW combined), the total land utilization will be 2025 acres (820 ha) out of total land area of 3852 acre. Depending on the final micrositing, WTGs may be spaced around 200m apart from one another in a series of rows and will have 103m rotor diameter, 80m hub height and 131m tip height. WTGs are manufactured by US based General Electric (GE). The landscape is semi-arid and sparsely populated. Isolated hamlets exist within the buffer area between TBCCPL A, B & C wind power plants, within the broader project site leased to the Company by Government of Sindh. The Company has designed the wind farm layout in such a way as to avoid physical and economic displacement and minimize the effect of shadow flicker and operational noise on the nearest hamlets. The closest sensitive receptor/residence is located 0.8  1 km from a WTG. The total footprint of the project is estimated to be less than 350 acres (i.e. wind turbine generators 2.5 acres/WTG x 87 WTGs, access road of about 60 acres, and a switchyard of about 10-15 acres) compared with the total 3,852 acres of the site. No physical or economic displacement of people is expected. Only the WTG land parcels and the project's substation land parcel will get fenced by the Company for safety and security reasons. The majority of the project site of 3,714 acres will remain free for access to villagers for their routine activities including grazing of their cattle and seasonal cultivation. TBCCPL is a special purpose vehicle majority-owned by Sapphire Group (the Sponsor). Sapphire Group is one of the oldest business groups in Pakistan with dominant presence in textile sector and now diversifying into power generation including renewable energy. The group has already established Sapphire Wind Power Company Limited (SWPCL), a 52.8 MW operating wind power plant in the same (Jhimpir) area. This project will be an independent power producer and will sell electricity to the Central Power Purchasing Agency Guarantee Limited (CPPA-G) under a separate 20-year Energy Purchase Agreement (EPA) for each 50 MW sub-project. CPPA-G's payment obligations under the EPAs will be guaranteed by the Government of Pakistan. The construction work will be carried out by Chinese Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) companies HydroChina Corporation and HydroChina International Engineering Company Limited (HydroChina), which are Chinese State owned companies fully owned by Power China International. HydroChina worked with Sapphire group for their 52.8 MW Sapphire Wind Power Co Ltd. The Company will also develop internal access roads to service the WTGs within each sub-project and access road from the existing public road. Between the three power plants there will be internal connecting road. A main construction camp will be developed at TBCCPL power plant B while two satellite facilities will be developed at TBCCPL power plants A & C.The WTGs will be connected to a 132 kV high voltage switchyard in the power plant via a 33 kV underground or over ground electrical collection system based on land topography. Electricity from the project will be transmitted from this 132 kV switchyard to the National Transmission and Dispatch Company Limited (NTDC) / Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (HESCO) 132 kV substation. NTDC will develop the connecting transmission line (about 20 km) from the 132 kV switchyard to their 132 kV substation. Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) examined the Company's Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) for TBCCPL power plants A, B & C and accorded environmental approval in 2014. It is expected that the parallel construction work will start during the last quarter of 2016 at TBCCPL power plant A, B & C and will be completed in 13-15 months. According to the Company's initial examination, no major environmental and social (E&S) risks are anticipated in relation to the NTDC transmission line or the access road; however, the final social and environmental impacts associated with transmission line will be subject to review under the SEPA's EIA process as well as additional review by IFC. The transmission line is considered as associated facility which is needed for the successful implementation of the project. The implementation of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is the responsibility of NTDC. Nevertheless, as per the agreed the Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP), the Company will monitor the progress of the EIA for the identified associated facility by keeping close contact with NTDC (ESAP Action No. 1(c)).","","","","IFC's review of the project included (i) a site visit from June 6-9 2016 to: the project site, transmission line routes, and access road, including inspection of the operating SWPCL 52.8 MW Wind power plant in Jhimpir, the existing substation facility and the double 132 kV transmission line interconnected to the national grid shared by SWPCL and, and internal roads within the concession area; (ii) meetings with technical, environmental, and social members of the SWPCL team; (iii) discussions with the environmental and social monitoring consultants (Arch Associates) and the EPC contractor (HydroChina); (iv) meeting with one existing family in the new project site; and (v) desktop reviews of TBCCPL power plants A, B & C's IEEs, the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), bird monitoring study, and other operational policies and procedures including technical, environmental, health and safety and social documents, and assessments submitted by the Company, and prepared against applicable IFC Performance Standards (PS). In addition, IFC used relevant information contained in the following three ESRSs that IFC disclosed for wind farm projects that are located in the same Jhimpir wind corridor: Zorlu Pakistan (56.4 MW), disclosed on April 11, 2011: Metro Power Company Limited (or 'MPCL', 50 MW), disclosed on August 22, 2013, and Gul Ahmed Wind Power Limited (50 MW) disclosed on November 13, 2014. IFC also reviewed Jhimpir Wind Farm Region Cumulative Impact Assessment document commissioned by OPIC (ERM, October 2015).","","","","","","","","","","","","In accordance to IFC's Environmental and Social Review Procedure (ESRP) and Policy on Social and Environmental Sustainability (PSES) the project is categorized as a Category B project because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result, which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria. The most critical environmental, social, and health and safety (ESHS) risks and impacts of the project include: (i) earth movements, vegetation cover removal, and soil erosion associated with excavation and the operation of construction equipment, (ii) occupational health and safety (OHS) risks to construction workers, and (iii) OHS risks to maintenance workers, (iv) potential health and safety risks to the nearby communities associated with dust emissions, high noise levels and blade throw, and (v) permanent landscape modifications.The project site is located in a semi desert area and mostly barren land with sparse vegetation. There are no formal villages and communities within the project site. However, there are some scattered settlements within the larger land parcel awarded to the project and a few hamlets exist mainly in the buffer area between TBCPPL power plants A, B & C. Project micro-siting is being undertaken to minimize impacts (dust emissions, noise, shadow flicker, etc.) on those isolated settlements.","","","","",38229,"",V-BC - Wind Power - Renewable Energy Generation,"","","",""

AXA Egypt is the holding company of two wholly owned Egyptian licensed joint stock insurance companies, specialized in, respectively, Life & Savings and Property & Casualty. It is expected the Company will also acquire a service company in due course. The Company plans to offer life, health and non-life insurance covers to individuals, SMEs and corporate clients. Through AXA Egypt, AXA intends to leverage the strength of its global presence and play a significant role in the fledgling private health sector in Egypt through health insurance and integrated health services. Life insurance products shall be provided through AXA Life Egypt, the former CIL life insurance company in Egypt acquired by AXA in 2015, while non-life insurance products will be provided through AXA General Insurance Egypt (formed in 2015).","","","","","","The project is expected to have a strong developmental impact by: 1) Enabling Fund Accumulation and Allocation: Insurers deploy long-term funds into the economy, allowing for long-term fund accumulation, thus supporting economic development and infrastructure build-up. This is particularly relevant for insurers with life businesses, which take long-term liabilities to provide life coverage to their policyholders and therefore seek long-term assets to invest into. Through the acquisition of CIL (a former IFC investee company, now AXA Life Egypt), AXA Egypt is expected to be a formidable player in Egypt''s life insurance space.2) Buttressing the Health Sector: AXA Egypt will enter the health insurance market and explores options to engage at a later stage in Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) services. This will contribute to closing the service gap as a growing middle class is seeking better healthcare and are expected to turn to privately run health care providers and insurers. The availability of sufficient private health care providers will lower overall private health care cost and make it more affordable for many upwardly mobile Egyptians to move out of the public health care system. This in turn is expected to unburden the public health care system, creating less stress on the limited resources of public health care.3) Support to SMEs: AXA Egypt aims to launch standardized, but adaptable SME insurance packages, thereby providing insurance cover to SMEs in a more cost-effective manner and ensuring this growing segment of the Egyptian economy.4) Support of Societies in Transition: Societies in transition and going through upheavals are in great need for risk management services so that individuals can be offered a safety net and can improve their social stability. Businesses can mitigate their enterprise risk through insurance coverage and thus are more comfortable taking risks and invest more.","","","1) Strategic Relationship: AXA is a strategic key relationship for IFC and a global partner in development with a large footprint in the insurance space worldwide, including emerging markets. IFC and AXA have signed a MoU which includes - apart from insurance coverage for women, road safety and micro-insurance - a strong intent to work together in new markets where AXA intends to enter.

Increasing financial inclusion in Romania: Access to credit and increasing the economic power of sub-borrowers would translate into improved livelihoods for a wide cross-section of society.4.

Radana Bhaskara Finance Tbk (&ldquo;Radana&rdquo; or &ldquo;Company&rdquo;), a 5 year (1 year grace) secured senior loan of up to US$40 million (equivalent to around IDR 530 billion) in either Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) or US Dollars. The security is expected to be a pledge over specific eligible receivables providing 100% coverage. IFC shall participate with up to US$20 million while the balance is being mobilized through a parallel or B loan. &nbsp;The loan will support Radana to diversify from motorcycle financing to multipurpose, working capital and investment financing for productive purposes to low and middle income clients, including micro, small and medium enterprises (&ldquo;MSME&rdquo;). The proceeds will finance i) micro, small and medium enterprises; ii) individuals utilizing the loans for productive purposes; iii) home renovations; iv) student-loans and (v) women borrowers. &nbsp;Radana, established in 1972, is a listed multi-finance company in Indonesia. The major business currently is motorcycle financing. The Company has a view to grow in the multi-purpose, investment and working capital financing areas through both conventional and Islamic finance.","","","In addition to the proposed project, IFC is also discussing an advisory proposal with Radana to help it implement its strategy in Indonesia. The advice will likely center around risk management, customer segmentation, distribution channels and enhancements to Radana&rsquo;s credit scoring process, particularly for multipurpose and MSME financing.","","The key risk is the ability of Radana to identify and manage the environmental and social ('E&S') risks associated with its planned lending activities in the MSME sector. Additional E&S risks and impacts of the project derive from the capacity and systems in place to manage these risks. At present Radana doesn't have an Environmental and Social Management System ('ESMS') outlining the procedures for undertaking E&S risk management of its lending activities. No staff/department has been assigned responsibility for E&S due diligence and monitoring, and training needs to be provided to all staff involved in the ESMS implementation. Radana does not have a documented grievance mechanism for employees and a non-discrimination and equal opportunity policy as required under the IFC Performance Standard 2: Labor and Working Conditions.","Deepening the Non-Banking Financial Institutions (""NBFI"") Sector: Financing Radana will help strengthen the NBFI sector in Indonesia which is still heavily dominated by banks. NBFIs can better serve individuals and small ticket loans as well as provide healthy competition to banks.  Increased Access to Finance: The Project will help support enterprises and the expansion of their activities, and play a modest, but meaningful role, in addressing the MSME market financing gap estimated at USD 25 billion. Access to finance enables firms to innovate and become more productive. The Company's diversification in its lending portfolio will increase average loan sizes and tenors and better serve the targeted sectors which comprise of low-to-middle income population in Indonesia including women borrowers.Job Creation and Private Sector Development: While the number of direct jobs the Project will support is limited, it will indirectly support job creation through the support of MSMEs which account for 97 percent of employment and 57 percent of value-added in the economy.Demonstration Effect: IFC's engagement with Radana at this stage, when the change in regulations has allowed multi finance companies to extend working capital and investment loan, is likely to encourage other multi finance companies to also enter into this space and therefore have a strong demonstration effect.Empowerment of Women: Supporting Radana to increase financing to women borrowers will help improve gender imbalance in access to finance in Indonesia, and therefore support economic empowerment. Evidence shows that achieving the World Bank Group twin goals of reduced poverty and shared prosperity is only possible if the private sector succeeds in efforts to include women in the economy and eliminate barriers to their full participation.","","","Provide Long term funding: IFC will provide Radana with long term funding which is limited in the market and which will help provide stability to NBFIs in difficult times. Currently the Company only has access to short to medium term funding from commercial banks and the capital markets. The longer term funding is required to provide stability in funding and to fund the growth of its longer tenor productive loans aimed at MSMEs and small to mid-scale entrepreneurs. Sector Knowledge/Expertise/Business Strategy: IFC will help the Company develop knowledge and expertise in lending for MSMEs, women borrowers and Islamic financing. IFC has local and global knowledge of such products and markets which will help the Company to develop new products and improve risk management.Diversify Funding Base and Mobilization: IFC will help mobilize long term funds for the Company and therefore help diversify funding sources to include multilateral lenders, who can offer mid-term funding especially in difficult timesStamp of Approval: IFC's participation will positively influence the market and public perception for Radana. This will help Radana raise additional funding in local and possibly international capital markets in the future.","","","Radana is 71% owned by PT Tiara Marga Trakindo (&ldquo;TMT&rdquo;), the TMT Group&rsquo;s parent entity.

Its primary interface with users is through smartphone app that connects independent motorcycle couriers with delivery assignments requested by end-users; Loggi retains a fee on each delivery and assists with other transactions (like payments for restaurant deliveries), also on a for-fee basis. It has recently launched a similar service for independent small delivery vans, focused primarily on next-day deliveries of package-sized e-commerce purchases. Its app-based delivery platforms currently regroup more than 2,600 motorcycle couriers and 140 van drivers (who also drive their own vehicles). Based in greater São Paulo, Loggi also has operations in the cities of Rio (Rio de Janeiro state), Belo Horizonte (Minais Gerais state), Curitiba (Paraná state), and Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul state), with plans to expand to other states as well. In addition to administrative offices in the São Paulo region, Rio, Belo Horizonte, and Curitiba, it also has a distribution center in São Paulo for 'cross-docking' purposes (repacking bulk e-commerce orders originating from clients' warehouses into smaller batches for at-home deliveries by vans and motorcycles), with plans for adding others. The company is owned by its founders and initial investors, including Kaszek Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures, Monashees Capital, and Dragoneer Investment Group.
