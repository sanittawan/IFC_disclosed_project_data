However, unlike its main competitors, its cooperation with Banco G&T Continental ('Banco'), its half-sister company, the country's second largest bank, and an IFC client, has been limited to a few areas of cooperation so far.  However, Seguros' owners and Banco's owners have realized that a closer cooperation between both entities in distributing insurance products and services through Banco's branch network would offer substantial synergies, higher turnover for both firms and a better penetration of the Guatemalan insurance market.  To assist the parties in unleashing that potential, IFC will invest in Seguros and acquire an equity stake of up to 15%.","","","","","","In strengthening the capital and operational base of the leading insurer in Guatemala, an institutional endorsement standard for other insurers in the country will be set.

The Fund primarily aims to: i) support the funding needs of mid-sized companies in the Asia region which are either too small for major banks or do not meet the risk profiles sought by such banks; and ii) purchase assets from financial institutions to help address asset quality and free up capital for new lending.

This investment will allow IFC to get access to TCX products as a client.

TCX is an innovative financial institution which provides long-term local currency ('LCY') and interest rate derivatives in emerging countries without active swap markets. TCX's objective is to promote long-term LCY financing for those borrowers in developing countries that do not have hard currency income, thereby contributing to a reduction in currency mismatches in the local market. 

TCX commenced with operations in February 2008. TCX's swap portfolio is naturally long emerging market currencies and short USD, because, unlike commercial providers of hedging products, TCX does not operate on a 'matched book' principle but instead relies on global portfolio diversification as the primary risk mitigation tool. TCX is structured to help its investors hedge exchange and interest rate risks associated with long-term investing in developing country currencies. These risks are transferred to TCX by means of medium to long-term swap agreements. TCX pools market risk from multiple investors with diversified geographical business. The resulting global diversification should lead to a risk reduction and economies of scale and scope. 

TCX is currently rated A- by Standard and Poors.","","","","","","TCX contributes to the development of the LCY markets by offering floating and fixed rate funding to counterparties for extended maturities and in situations where long benchmark rates are either illiquid or not available. This will facilitate future lending in LCY by fostering competition, price signals, extending the tenors and reducing the cost of LCY debt. 

The use of hedging reduces the currency/maturity mismatch of emerging market borrowers, strengthens their balance sheet and encourages a more efficient use of their capital.

TCX's focus on Sub Saharan Africa & microfinance aims to get a maximum effect where it is most needed. TCX is committed to achieve its focus in these two segments by establishing a lower minimum deal size and by charging less capital to transactions in these areas (Dutch government incentive).","","","","",This project consists of IFC investment in a currency exchange fund that provides currency and interest rate hedging in EM currencies and has been classified as a Category C project according to IFC''s Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

Techno is a power sector engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) company for the last three decades and has recently started investing in wind power projects. Techno including its subsidiaries already has 95.45 MW of operating wind power assets in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

The Company is developing two wind farm projects (75.90 MW + 51.00 MW) aggregating 126.90 MW located in Tirunelveli and Tiruppur districts respectively in Tamil Nadu ('Project'). Of the total capacity proposed, 25.20 MW comprised of 12 x 2.1 MW wind turbine generators (WTGs) is located in Amadapuram/Devarkulam, Sankarankovil Taluk, Tirunelveli district. A further 50.70 MW comprised of 12 x 2.1 MW WTGs and 17 x 1.5 MW WTGs is proposed at Rastha Taluk in Tirunelveli District. The 51.00 MW located in Mutthiampatti, Dharapuram Taluk, Tiruppur District is comprised of 34 x 1.5 MW WTGs.  All these sites are being developed by Suzlon ('Developer') on a turnkey basis, which involves securing land, necessary consents and approvals, material, construction and commissioning. Further, the Project will be operated and maintained (O&M) by Suzlon under an O&M contract with Simran.
 

The Project also involves setting up for each WTG a transformer switchyard and a transmission line to the nearest substation but other infrastructure facilities (i.e. central monitoring station, maintenance workshop; stores; and staff quarters) will be shared with Suzlon's other projects/WTGs. Typically, each central monitoring station (CMS) is an O&M hub (with stores and personnel from various functions) and  caters to 50-75 WTGs installed within a 15 km radius from the CMS.  A 11 kV or 33 kV transmission line comprised of conductors mounted on 11 m high poles will be constructed and connected to the nearest 220 kV substation, the nearest facility of the state utility (Tamil Nadu Electricity Board). The WTGs at Muthiampatti site will be connected to the 200 MW TNEB substation located at Velarasi Vadamalaipalayam, which is at about 7 km from the Muthiampatti site. Further, 25 MW of the Amdapuram site will be connected to a 100 MW substation at Amthapuram located at about 10 km from the site and the balance 50.70 MW will be connected to a 200 MW substation at Rastha located at about 7 km from the Rastha project site.

Total land required for the Project is expected to be about 375 acres spread over all the WTG locations in Tirunelveli and Tiruppur districts and includes the land for WTGs, transformer yard and access roads. Typically, each WTG is located in the center of a 100 x 100 m land plot, which includes also the transformer and switchyard for the WTG. However, 5 acres of land is usually purchased for each WTG location to be used as lay down area and for use by cranes during WTG installation and if required, for O&M purposes. The T-Line footprint is limited to a 1 x 1 m area around each pole. The Project WTGs will be located in a sparsely populated, generally flat or mildly undulating terrain on privately owned cultivated or barren land.","","","","IFC is considering an equity investment in Simran Wind Project Private Limited ('Simran' or the 'Company') and a project loan to finance 126.90 MW of wind power projects being implemented by the Company in Tamil Nadu state in India.

Paravani,Investment,Environmental Documents,Active,Europe and Central Asia,Georgia,Georgia Urban Energy LLC,Regional Industry - INF ECA,2011-04-01T04:00:00Z,"",A,Other,"Georgia Urban Enerji Ltd (GUE), intends to build and operate an 87 MW run-of-river Hydro Power Plant (HPP), on the Paravani River, near the town of Ahalkalaki, Georgia. The project Sponsors are the Anadolu Group, one of the leading Turkish conglomerates.  The rights to develop the Project are held by GUE, a Georgian special purpose vehicle owned 100% by the Sponsors. The project area is located in the Samstkhe-Javakheti Region of southern Georgia, close to the Turkish border. In addition to power generation facilities, the Project includes a conveyance tunnel of 13.8 km and a 32 km, 220 kV double circuit transmission line (T-line) linking the project to the new 500 kV Georgia-Turkey interconnector near Akhaltsikhe. The Project will supply electricity to the Georgian market in the three consecutive winter months, expected to be January, February and March, and export power to the Turkish market in the remaining nine months of the year. The total Project cost is estimated at US$ 156.5 million. The Project will be financed by IFC, EBRD and TSKB, a Turkish bank (as an IFC/EBRD B lender). The proposed IFC investment consists of an A Loan for up to $37.5 million, or 24% of Project cost. The project will consist of a 5 m high concrete gravity weir with a small (4000 m3, 0.5 ha) impoundment, a 13.8 km long power tunnel, a 1 km long penstock and a powerhouse with switchyard. The scheme will exploit a gross head of 420 m and the power house will have two Francis turbines. The intake structure will be located on the Paravani River a short distance downstream of the confluence with Korkhistskali Stream, at an elevation of around 1550 m. The small impoundment will not be designed for storage purposes and will store around five minutes worth of river flow. River diversion works during construction of the weir will include a bridge across the Paravani River to access the left bank, a 189 m concrete diversion channel on the right bank adjacent to the road, a 6 m high upstream coffer dam (temporary barrier excluding water from a river section to allow construction) and a 6 m high downstream coffer dam.The Paravani River is 66 km long and stretches from its source, Lake Paravani, to the Mtkvari River  also known as the Kura River - and the proposed weir site is located 53 km downstream from the lake. The weir site is located in a steep valley adjacent to a paved road and is remote from any settlements, the nearest of which is located high above the valley floor on top of the plateau. With flows ranging from only 6 to 30 m3/sec, the 13 km stretch of river downstream of the weir which will be most affected by the project is not currently utilized for drinking, livestock watering or irrigation purposes and is not currently inhabited. Two fish farms, one of which has a micro-hydro power plant utilizing a tributary stream, are located in this so called by-passed (or depleted) section, from which much of the usual flow will be diverted into the power tunnel. The powerhouse and switchyard will be located on a terrace on the right bank of the Mtkvari River approximately 1.5 km upstream of the confluence of the Mtkvari and Paravani Rivers and adjacent to a main road. Water will reach the powerhouse via the power tunnel, a surge tank and the penstock which will fall steeply from near the top of the plateau to the powerhouse site. Water will be discharged into the Mtkvari River via a tailrace canal.","","","","IFC visited the project weir and powerhouse sites in February 2010 together with the Sponsor, the project environmental consultants (Gamma Scientific of Georgia) and EBRD. A project-related meeting was held in Tbilisi with the National Agency for Cultural Heritage Preservation and a senior UNESCO representative. IFC met with the Sponsor and other potential financiers again in July 2010 in Istanbul, after which a further mission was undertaken to Georgia including technical, environmental and financial staff of the main lenders and the Sponsor. A project visit was undertaken involving the proposed diversion weir site on the Paravani River, certain project access roads, the main construction camp site, the main power tunnel adits, access roads across the plateau, Chunchka Village  the closest settlement to the weir working areas  and the powerhouse site. Site meetings were held with village representatives at Chunchkha, pre-construction contractors and Project representatives. Brief visits were also made to Khertvisi Fortress and the Vardzia rock-cut monastery complex located at the respective ends of the Khertvisi-Vardzia cultural heritage area. A follow-up meeting was held in Tbilisi with representatives of the National Agency for Cultural Heritage Preservation and UNESCO National Commission for Georgia. A meeting was also held with Georgias Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, to discuss the projects environmental and social impacts and related permitting and monitoring matters.IFC also reviewed and commented on several versions of the following key environmental, health and safety and social documents:·	Paravani HPP ESIA, 2009 ·	Paravani Transmission Line ESIA, 2010 ·	Paravani HPP and Transmission Line: ESIA Non-Technical Summary, 2011 ·	Paravani HPP and Transmission Line: Environmental & Social Action Plan, 2011 ·	Paravani HPP and Transmission Line: Stakeholder Engagement Plan, 2011 These documents were produced by Gamma Scientific Services, a Georgian consulting firm, on behalf of the Sponsors.","","","","","","","","","","","","The Project is categorized A as it involves potentially significant adverse impacts related to tunneling and spoil management, access road improvement and construction, construction of a diversion weir in the Paravani River and construction of a 32 km high-voltage transmission line. Operation of the scheme will reduce flow in a 13 km downstream reach of the Paravani river by up to ninety percent.  In addition, part of the project will be located on the edge of a valley section rich in cultural heritage, in the buffer zone of the Kertvisi-Vardzia area which is on UNESCOs Tentative list as a future World Heritage site, having been proposed by the Government of Georgia in 2007. The Paravani River is a tributary to the Mtkvari (Kura) River, which is an international waterway flowing from Turkey, through Georgia and Azerbaijan into the Caspian Sea.

The Project is comprised of two related investments namely, a $100 million senior loan facility to KCB ,  one of largest and systemically important banks in Kenya and the East Africa region and a $5 million equivalent senior loan, in Rwanda Francs for KCB's wholly owned subsidiary KCB Rwanda Limited ('KCBR'). The Project is expected to provide the Bank with significant long-term financing support of its strategic objectives. 

The funding will be used to support the Group's regional expansion, increase access to finance for crucial sectors of the economy such as SME's, and facilitate increased mortgage lending especially for affordable housing. The use of proceeds will also reach the Bank's subsidiaries in the East Africa region and hence increase IFC reach in IDA countries. 

The senior loan facility to KCBR will be sourced through IFCs recently signed swap agreement with the National Bank of Rwanda ('NBR'), and will  boost its long term funding base and allow it to increase mortgage lending for affordable housing. The investment for this project will be coupled with IFC's mortgage toolkit technical Assistance to strengthen the Bank's mortgage finance business.","","","","","","i) Support Lending and Growth in the East African Market: 
The East African banking sector was affected by the global financial crisis, which led to a slowdown in the economy and reduced lending by the banking sector. Now that the situation has stabilized, KCB is well positioned to increase lending in the local market, which is important for investment and economic recovery in the region. The Project will, therefore, support the resumption of lending by KCB ultimately supporting renewed economic activity.

(ii) Increased Access to Finance for SMEs: 
SME's are a key growth sector for KCB. IFC will assist with SME development beyond financing to include advisory services for key aspects of its SME operations. The expected improvement in access to finance for SMEs will help to generate employment at the grass roots level and further facilitate regional trade which is expected to grow rapidly following the economic integration of the East African Community.

(iii) The investment in KCB Rwanda will have high development impact.  On an institutional level, access to longer term local currency financing will help KCBR manage its liquidity more effectively by limiting foreign currency risk.  On a sector level, the introduction of longer term financing in the market will afford more options to SME's and individual borrowers by providing longer term financing for mortgages and other new products.  In addition, the proposed technical assistance program will build the Bank's capacity in mortgage origination and monitoring in line with global best practice.

(iv) Support regional Expansion and integration

EMC provides global satellite communication using a high quality, fully managed network.  The Company began its activities in 2002.","","","","","","Improve productivity through connectivity:  The impact of increased and affordable access to communications and data services is widely acknowledged, with far reaching benefits in terms of private and public sector productivity, including market information, education, tele-medicine and extending financial services to the frontier.  Increased coverage: EMC has the capacity to deliver fully managed, end-to-end solutions in difficult countries and regions where satellite technology is the best or only alternative. Broader range of services:  Further to basic data and voice, EMC can support more sophisticated applications, processes and corporate software solutions such as SAP and Oracle.Enhance competition:  Often, EMC is the only viable alternative to the incumbent telecomsoperator.  Supporting EMC helps increase competition and provides comfort to many f its customers that sensitive communications will be handled with privacy. Reduction in travel/carbon footprint:   EMCs Video-on-Demand solution to be deployed in 2011 will allow customers to collaborate with their colleagues, clients and suppliers without the need to physically travel in and out of remote locations.Vulnerable ultimate beneficiaries:  Clients in main vertical (development agencies / NGOs, accounting for 54% of revenues), directly target the base of pyramid, especially in Africa.  These institutions reach would be limited without the services of specialized niche providers such as EMC. Quick deployments:  EMC has a custom-designed solution allowing fast, tactical implementation of communications links following natural catastrophes (i.e., most recently in the Haiti and Chile earthquakes). EMC''s personnel, a team of highly trained and experienced professionals, is available and ready to deploy and implement satellite services within 48 hours thanks to a stock of pre-staged equipment at regional offices across all continents.

The Company's strategy is to build a sustainable upstream business through leveraging its regional knowledge and relationships; maintaining a balanced portfolio of production, development, appraisal and exploration of assets; enforcing strict capital allocation discipline; and pursuing targeted acquisitions in addition to organic-led growth. Since its foundation in early 2005, Salamander has developed a broad set of assets, although the proposed refinancing is restricted to the producing and near-production interests in Indonesia and Thailand.  As of 1st January 2011, the Company reported net reserves of 66.3 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) and average daily production of 20,300 boe. 

As with the 2008-2009 investments, the proposed refinancing is intended for the capital and operating expenditure needs of two existing Salamander-operated producing fields: 

 (i)   Glagah Kambuna  offshore north Sumatra, Indonesia.
 (ii)  Block B8/38 Concession (Bualuang) - offshore Gulf of Thailand;

Salamander also has minority interests (less than 10 %) in three fields operated by other companies but which are part of the borrowing base assets:

(iii) E5-N and EU-1 Concessions - onshore northeast Thailand;
(iv) ONWJ  offshore northwest Java, Indonesia;
(v) SES  offshore southeast Sumatra, Indonesia; and

The project will include the drilling of new wells in existing fields, the selective workover of existing wells and the construction of gas processing facilities and other field infrastructure. Salamander forecasts that the project will help it to increase its production to reach over 30,000 boe per day by 2013.

The following sections provide an update on the operation of the Salamander operated properties since IFC's 2010 disclosure.

Operated Assets

Kambuna - Indonesia  
Salamander now has 50% operatorship under a Technical Assistance Contract with Pertamina (the Indonesian oil and gas operator). Production commenced in August 2009 from a total of three offshore wells tied into an unmanned platform. No production processes, such as water separation, are undertaken on the platform.  In 2009 Salamander completed construction of a pipeline (42km offshore / 15km onshore) from the wellhead to an onshore  LPG asset and compressor station located on Pertamina's existing Pangkalan Brandan  facilities. Kambuna gas is exported south via the regional transmission system and is largely used for electrical power generation for Medan, Indonesia's second largest city.  

Bualuang  Thailand
Salamander now holds a 100% interest in the block and operatorship of the B8/38 Concession, the concession expires in 2025. Production patterns remain as described in the previous disclosure but a further phase of drilling on the field was completed in the first half of 2009, which included an exploration well, two horizontal producers and a water disposal well. The two horizontal production wells were tied into the production system and put on stream.  Within the existing footprint, a further six wells are planned for first half of 2011 (Phase 5) with drilling of three new horizontal wells and the sidetracking of three existing vertical wells with horizontal sections. With the completion of the Phase 5 development drilling, an expansion of production facilities is required. At the time of IFCs 2011 supervision visit, Salamander was preparing for an additional two phases of development drilling, with plans for a second wellhead.  Salamander will undertake an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) in compliance with Thai Legislation and consistent with Performance Standards requirements for the installation of the Bualuang offshore production platform and drilling of new wells not covered under the existing field ESIA.","","","","Background

In 2008 IFC was requested by the management of Salamander to provide up to $75 million of corporate financing to help fund the company's planned 2008-2010 investment program. IFC provided senior and junior debt financing of $62.5 million to Salamander in 2008 and 2009, details of which were publically disclosed in June 2008, and redisclosed with updated information in March 2010. 

Following on from these current corporate investments in Salamander,  IFC has recently been requested by the management of Salamander to continue to support the Company's growth by providing a refinancing of up to $75 million in the forms of senior and junior lending facilities covering the same assets as the 2008/2009 investments. This corporate repeat financing, which is part of a broader refinancing package involving a number of other financial institutions, will help fund the Company's planned 2011-2013 investment program and refinance Salamander's existing debt. 

This review should be read in conjunction with the previously disclosed review of March 2010, updated information on the company's assets is provided below.

Overview of  IFC's Scope of Review

This investment is limited to the Borrowing Base Assets described below which cover the same footprint as the original investments which themselves covered exploration and pre-existing brownfield sites. This review provides an update of the original appraisal visit undertaken in 2008, ongoing annual site supervision visits to various Salamander assets and review of annual monitoring reports submitted to IFC.  Site supervision has included visits to Salamander's corporate office in Singapore, Salamander country offices in Jakarta and Bangkok supported by two visits to the Kambuna field (Indonesia) in 2010, and one visit to the Bualuang field (Thailand) in 2011.  The visits also included review of technical and policy documents, interviews with Salamander staff and contractors, members of local communities and local government officials. Salamander's commitment to environmental and social performance is evident and it demonstrates this through the continued development of corporate and project level environmental and social management systems and procedures.","","","","","","","","","","","","This is a refinancing of existing IFC investments in the Company which are all IFC Category B. Since the portfolio assets and footprint being refinanced has not changed and the scale of operations has not materially changed, the refinancing is also given a B Category. Category B projects according to IFC's Environmental and Social Review Procedure are those that result in a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts that can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to industry recognized standards, guidelines and design criteria.  The existing Salamander operated portfolio consists of both exploration, development and production assets. 

Salamander has a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Policy and a Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Policy which commit Salamander to conduct all its operations in compliance with applicable laws, recognized international standards and best practice which includes the safety and health of employees, protection of the environment and that the interests of the communities are respected in areas where Salamander operates.

Under the umbrella of the HSE Policy, the environmental or social impacts arising from current and planned assets are being, and will be mitigated and managed in accordance with national regulatory requirements and IFC's Performance Standards within Salamander's overarching corporate Health, Safety and Environment Management System (HSEMS) framework.  

The existing Salamander operated assets, which are the focus of this investment (the Borrowing Base Assets) are not anticipated to result in any significant adverse environmental and social impacts.  In 2008 Salamander presented plans to address the environmental and social impacts at its operated assets, and IFC has monitored progress through regular supervision. Implementation of the Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) which has been updated will ensure these assets continue to remain in compliance with IFC Performance Standards and its Environmental Health Safety (EHS) guidelines.

Salamander may wish to acquire additional assets and acreage in the future for inclusion in the Borrowing Base.  Salamander screens all prospective assets to establish the requirements for compliance with the IFC Performance Standards.  As required, IFC may undertake additional supplementary appraisal missions to further characterize the environmental and social risk of proposed asset acquisitions prior to giving approval for inclusion within the current BBA facility.  

Salamander will periodically review and update its CSR and HSE Policies commensurate with its operational risks and expanding portfolio. Prior to full field development and production of new assets where Salamander is the operator, Salamander will prepare and publicly disclose a full ESIA and an ESAP consistent with IFC's Performance Standards for all future assets where Salamander is the operator.

For the non-operated assets included in the BBA portfolio, the operators which include Hess and CNOOC have a good HSE Management Systems in place and conduct their operations in accordance with national laws, regulations and good international industry practice.","","","","",30727,"",AB - Oil and Gas Production (Includes Development),"","","",""

Salamander 2011,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,East Asia and the Pacific,East Asia and Pacific Region,OPHIR THAILAND (E&P) LIMITED,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2011-04-18T04:00:00Z,2011-05-19T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"Salamander Energy plc (Salamander or the company) is a rapidly-growing junior oil and gas company exclusively focused on Southeast Asia. The company's strategy is to build a sustainable upstream business through leveraging its regional knowledge and relationships; maintaining a balanced portfolio of production, development, appraisal and exploration assets; enforcing strict capital allocation discipline; and pursuing targeted acquisitions in addition to organic-led growth. Since its foundation in early 2005, Salamander has developed a broad set of assets, including producing and near-production interests in Indonesia and Thailand as well as exploration and appraisal properties in Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Lao PDR and the Philippines. The company reported net proved and probable reserves of 66.3 million barrels of oil equivalent ('boe') and average daily production of 20,000 boe, of which about 34% is gas. 

Salamander is an existing client of IFC.  IFC supported its growth through both debt and equity investments over the last few years.  IFC has been requested to continue to support the Company's growth by providing up to $75 million debt financing in the forms of both senior and junior lending facilities. The financing will help fund the Company's planned 2011-2013 investment program that is primarily expected to cover the capital and operating expenditure needs of the following producing and near-production assets: 

-  the E5-N and EU-1 Concessions (Sinphuhorm) and the Block B8/38 Concession (Bualuang) in Thailand; and 
-  the Offshore North West Java (ONWJ), South East Sumatra (SES) Production Sharing Contracts, and the Glagah Kambuna Technical Assistance Contract in Indonesia. 

The project will include the drilling of new wells in existing fields, the selective workover of existing wells and the construction of gas processing facilities and other field infrastructure. 

The project will also include the refinancing of existing indebtedness and other general corporate uses. Salamander expects that the project will help it to increase its production to reach 30,000 boe per day by 2013.","","","","","","- Enhanced Availability of a Cleaner Fuel:  The Project will support the development of natural gas reserves. The increased availability of natural gas will promote the use of a cleaner fuel, given that natural gas has much lower carbon emissions than coal which is frequently the alternative fuel for power generation in Southeast Asia. 

- Preservation and Creation of Employment: The Project will have a sustaining impact on existing employment levels in producing assets and will contribute to the creation of new jobs in assets about to enter into production. Salamander staff positions are generally remunerated at a 25%-30% premium to other comparable employment. The percentage of nationals in managerial positions tends to be high, mostly above 75%. 

- Contribution to Central and Local Government Revenues: The project will increase production and generate significant fiscal receipts from a combination of royalties (8-12.5%), corporate taxes (41.5%-50.0%), production sharing (42%-73%) and obligations to supply domestic consumers at below-market prices. A material portion of these - approximately 15% of royalties in Thailand and 15-30% of total government payments in Indonesia - is expected to ultimately accrue to the regions where the oil and gas activities are undertaken. 

- Generating Additional Business for Local and National Suppliers: The project is expected to have a positive impact on national and regional economic activity through the purchasing of equipment, products and services.  For example, in 2009 contracts worth more than US$121 million were sourced from regional and national suppliers. 

- Promoting Competition and Development of Marginal Fields: The project promotes competition in the oil and gas sector through the growth of one of very few independent exploration and production companies exclusively focused on Southeast Asia. The participation of smaller privately-owned companies is important to the industry, as they often focus on reserves deemed too small to be of interest to the majors and the national oil companies which dominate the sector in Southeast Asia, and deliver production and recovery rates which tend to be above industry averages.

- Development in Frontier Regions: One of the Company's major assets, the Sinphuhorm Gas Field, is in the Northeast part of Thailand, a region that is by far the poorest and has been excluded from much of Thailand's growth.  Salamander's spending on local purchases is expected to have a positive impact on the regional economic activity, help to increase the income of the local people and promote an inclusive growth. 

Going forward, the following indicators will be tracked (i) gas production; (ii) employment; (iii) tax payments and other revenues to host governments; (iv) domestic purchase; (v) community development outlays.","","","","","This is a refinancing of existing IFC investments in the Company which are all IFC Category B.

Salamander maintains corporate headquarters in London, and operational offices in Singapore, Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, Bangkok and Vientiane.

Governance risks assessment 

It is expected that benefits from the project will accrue to different levels of government in Indonesia and Thailand in the form of royalties and taxes. In evaluating this project, IFC took into consideration the value of the project's benefits and governance and other risks to these benefits. In particular, it utilized a range of governance assessment methodologies, including but not limited to Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index and the World Bank Institute's Governance Indicators, as well as the current relationship between Indonesia/Thailand and the World Bank Group ('WBG').  Thailand has been relatively strong in terms of transparency and ease of doing business in the East Asia and Pacific region, and for the past several years, the WBG has been partnering with Thai public and private institutions on a range of important developmental challenges, including governance and public sector reform. Indonesia is in progress of implementing EITI and is working towards its first EITI report.  The WBG's assistance to Indonesia emphasizes engagements with government counterparts and other stakeholders who are committed to addressing critical governance and institutional challenges.  

On balance, given the governance context, the expected development impact and the projected benefits, IFC believes that this is a project which it should support.","This is a refinancing of existing IFC investments in the Company which are all IFC Category B.

The proposed project is to expand the current production capacity with additional, mainly greenfield, pig production facilities near Pskov in Western Russia. While all the current large scale pig production facilities are relying on feed stock from the commodity market, and manure handling through farmers off-take contracts, the Pskov facility will have its own crop production farm with sustainable internal balance in manure production and fertilizer needs for the crop production.

The new crop farm and pig production facility is based on re-farming of previously idle / brackish farmland that has not been under commercial production since the cease of the Soviet farms in early 1990ies, and the construction of a 3,450 sow pig production facility for production of 98,000 slaughter pigs per year in the midst of these fields, hereby establishing a sustainable balance between manure produced by the pigs and the ammonia and phosphate fertilizer needs of the land farmed for crop production.  The crop farm has a total of 4,000 ha of land available of which 3,500 ha will be used for the production of crops (mainly spring and winter crops of barley and wheat) for the pig farm feed mill. The new pig production consist of physically separated sections (sows w/piglet production section, small (weaner) pig section, finisher section for pigs getting ready for slaughtering, and a boar section for sperm production), as well as a feed mill and systems for manure handling in sealed lagoons capable of holding the manure for twice yearly application as fertilizer on the crop fields.

- Support the frontier Pskov region (per capita GDP about 60% below national average) to revitalize waste land, develop competitive pig and crop production, create jobs in remote rural area, contribute to local community.

This project consists of an equity investment in Medanito S.A. ('Medanito' or the 'Company') a mid-size Argentinean company active in oil and gas exploration and production, LPG production as well as natural gas treatment services.   

IFC is considering an equity investment of up to US$50 million in Medanito to be used to support the exploration and development of the Company's existing oil and gas onshore concessions across three Provinces in Argentina.  These brownfield assets are located in sparsely populated areas.

Overview of IFC's scope of review:

The review of this project consisted of a document review, including the project's technical, environmental, social and health and safety reports and records; a field visit to assess the effectiveness of the Environmental, Social and Health and Safety (ESHS) Management System at the facilities in Neuquén, Rio Negro and La Pampa provinces; and interviews with key personnel of the company.

The following management elements were assessed:

- Adequacy of the existing Environmental, Social, Health and Safety Management System to satisfy IFC's Performance Standards requirements;
- The client's assessment of potential ESHS impacts related to its activities;
- Labor issues and Human Resources policy;
- Company and Contractors' EHS performance;
- Air emissions;
- Pollution prevention issues;
- Liquid and solid waste management;
- Drilling procedures including solid waste disposal;
- Biodiversity issues;
- Emergency Response Plans;
- Stakeholder engagement and social issues;
- Potential land use and compensation issues;
- Cultural and Archaeological chance-find procedure.","","","","","","","","","","","","The scope of this project covers a relatively small footprint of existing brownfield assets. The management of the company will be improved by IFC's investment as a result of the integration of IFC Performance Standards and EHS Guidelines into Medanito's existing EHS Management System. This project has thus been assessed as a category B project.

The Company's current activities consist of a) an oil and gas exploration and production program, including drilling programs, exploration activities in current assets, construction of new processing and storage facilities within existing areas and  small managed forests. Category B projects are those that according to IFC's Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects have a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to the applicable Performance Standards, guidelines and design criteria.","","","","",30701,"",AB - Oil and Gas Production (Includes Development),"","","",""

A long-term IFC client, San Miguel has evolved its operations to comply with IFC's E&S requirements and applicable WBG's EHS Guidelines and to increase its sustainability in accordance with good industry's standards such as GlobalGAP; and, is nearing completion of a complex industrial wastewater management system. San Miguel, with the imprimatur of its internationally recognized food safety certifications in raw materials production and in processing exported diverse products, achieved 2009 revenue of US$207 million. San Miguel core operations are in Argentina, with more than 5,500 ha in plantations and downstream processing/packing facilities.","","","","IFC's environmental specialist visited San Miguel's operations located in Tucuman and Famailla, Argentina. Famailla Industrial Plant area evaluations included the nursery and orchard at Monte Grande and the lemon processing plant. The fresh fruit packing operation located in the city of San Miguel de Tucuman was also evaluated. IFC participated in meetings with senior management, line management and staff responsible for operations and production. Of particular relevance to IFC's appraisal of this investment were the meetings with management and staff responsible for the environmental, occupational health and safety issues and social/community relations. Special attention was paid to the status of corrective actions addressing E&S performance in prior Environmental and Social Action Plans (ESAP) associated with previous IFC investments, namely San Miguel II (#23850) and Milagro (#26890). These included specifically the evaluation of the industrial plant's wastewater treatment operations, including the management of biosolids, OHS in both plants and orchards, and specific commercial and OHS-related management system certifications held by San Miguel. Company operations in Uruguay (ref. Milagro) were not visited as current reporting on E&S performance and completion of Milagro ESAP action items clearly demonstrates satisfactory overall environmental, social and OHS performance at these facilities. Previous Milagro ESAP action items completed were related to revision of human resources policies, the planning and implementation of a community engagement program, upgrades to the facility integrated pest and disease management program and planning and implementation of a water resources conservation program.","","","","","","","","","","","","This investment is categorized as a B as there are no elements of the project with diverse, unprecedented or irreversible, negative social or environmental impacts. Company operations are well known to IFC since more than 12 years.  Previous E&S issues of concern, such as effluent management has been (and/or are being) addressed by San Miguel. This appraisal confirmed that many considerations are receiving appropriate management attention; and, that new initiatives and approaches to avoiding, managing or mitigating E&S impacts are in place and continue to drive improved performance. The Company does not engage with the community in other than in an ad hoc manner. Nevertheless, no serious social/community issues were observed or discovered related to industrial operational practices during the appraisal or have been reported in previous Annual E&S Monitoring Reports (AMRs).","","","","",30846,"",AF - Fruits and Vegetables,"","","",""

The company's main assets are the Aguada del Chivato/ Aguada Bocarey E&P concession in the Neuquen Province, and the Catriel Gas Complex in the Rio Negro Province. The company holds three other exploitation concessions and seven exploration licenses in the Neuquen basin, as well as an early-stage forestry business.  Current oil and gas production net to Medanito is 1,185 barrels per day ('b/d') and 14,600 thousand cubic feet per day ('mcf/d'), respectively. The company also produces 177 tonnes per day ('T/d') of LPG, and 72 T/d of natural gasolines.

The expected benefits will come in the form of:

1.	  Increased supply of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas: IFC expects that Medanito's upstream production will increase from the current level of 3,600 boe/d. About 60% of this upstream production consists of natural gas.  Continued support for gas production and displacement of more carbon-intensive fuels is a key part of the World Bank Group's strategy, as natural gas is endorsed as a bridging fuel in the transition to a low carbon economy. The increased levels of gas production will also mitigate Argentina's dependence on gas imports. 

2. 	Contribution to Government revenues: the project will result in increased sales of natural gas, LPG, and crude oil. The associated provincial taxes, royalties, and federal income taxes will provide an important source of income to the Federal and Provincial Governments (incremental fiscal revenues are estimated at more than US$150 million over the next decade). 

3.  Creation/preservation of local employment and sourcing in Argentina: by extending the life of the Company's reserves, the project will help to secure direct and indirect jobs in the Provinces of Neuquen and Rio Negro. The project will also have an impact on regional economic activity through local purchasing. 

IFC plans to monitor the following indicators during supervision: (i) annual production of natural gas in Argentina (mcf); (ii) payments to governments (US$); and (iii) purchases of domestic goods and services (US$).

Governance risks assessment

It is expected that benefits from the project will accrue to different levels of government in Argentina in the form of taxes and royalties. Benefits to the local population are also anticipated in the form of direct and indirect employment. In coming to a view on whether to support this project, IFC has reviewed a range of governance and transparency metrics including, but not limited to, The World Bank Institute's Governance Indicators and Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. The Government has committed to strengthening public sector performance within Argentina's federal system, with a view towards improving the effectiveness of basic service delivery and building transparency and trust, objectives that are supported by the World Bank Group. In addition, the Governments of Neuquen, La Pampa, and Rio Negro adhere to the 2004 ""Ley de Reponsabilidad Fiscal"", meant to promote fiscal discipline at the provincial level. Separately, IFC requires all its extractive industry clients to publicly disclose taxes, royalties and other payments made to governments.  On balance, given the governance situation in the country and the project's expected development benefits, IFC believes that this is a project which it should support.","","","","","The key social and environmental aspects to address in this project include:  i) adequacy of the Environmental, Social, Health and Safety Management System; ii)  the Companys assessment and management of potential ESHS impacts related to its activities; iii) Company and contractors ESHS performance; iv) Pollution prevention; v) Biodiversity; vi) Stakeholder engagement.

The Khandwa water supply project, Madhya Pradesh, is a public-private partnership between Khandwa Municipal Corporation (Khandwa MC) and Vishwa, under the Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns (UIDSSMT). The project will commence supplying 29 million L/day (MLD) to Khandwa (population 240,000) for domestic consumption, increasing to 43 MLD by the end of the concession period (2034), meeting the current shortfall by almost doubling the volume of water currently supplied. Under this build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) scheme, Vishwa has a 25 year concession period (2 years construction, 23 years operation and maintenance). The project will pump water through an intake well on the Chhotitave River, a backwater of the Indira Sagar Reservoir, to the adjacent water treatment plant (WTP). The WTP (2.7 ha site) will treat water using water clarification / the application of alum for flocculation and chlorination, then pump it to Khandwa via a 50 km long 800 mm reinforced trunk pipeline. The pipeline will discharge into a 1,222 m3 ground level master balancing reservoir (GLMBR), from where it will be pumped to nine separate overhead tanks. Water will then be gravity fed to the township. The project includes the laying of 60 km of poly distribution pipeline through the streets of Khandwa. Project construction commenced in late 2010.The Kolhapur STP and allied works, Maharashtra, is a long-term public-private partnership between Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (Kolhapur MC) and Vishwa. The project, an initiative contributing to the Panchganga Action Plan (PAP), has the objective of preventing and controlling the discharge of sewage entering the Panchganga River via the four main nallahs (streams) that drain Kolhapur. The Ichalkaranji section of the Panchganga River was declared critically polluted by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The existing city STP (43 MLD treatment capacity) is limited to primary treatment (primary screening, grit removal and settling) and has inadequate capacity. As a result, treated sewage does not meet CPCB standards, and overflows from the existing STP plus partially treated and untreated sewage flow almost directly into the Panchganga River that serves as a potable water source for Kolhapur and other settlements. The project will intercept and pump untreated sewage from nallahs into the new STP. The STP will treat wastewater using: (a) primary treatment - conventional mechanical methods; and (b) secondary treatment - sequential batch reactor (SBR) technology that allows variable flows to be treated by this activated sludge method. A high quality effluent will be produced with low turbidity and low nitrogen levels. The STP will service Kolhapur city (population 493,000 in 2001) with a treatment capacity of 76 MLD, replacing the existing STP. The project consists of: the STP at Kasba Bawda; a sewerage pumping station and rising main at Bagat Camp and Line Bazaar; a rising main at Jayant Nallah; a discharge pipe between the STP and Panchganga River; and miscellaneous civil works. Under this design, finance, construct, operate and maintain scheme, Vishwa has a 15 year concession period (2 years construction, 13 years operation and maintenance). The STP site is located within an existing compound owned by Kolhapur MC, next to the existing STP operated by the Corporation.

Potential adverse construction impacts are likely to be limited to project sites, short term, able to be effectively managed and mitigated, and likely to have no or limited impact on environmentally sensitive features and sites. Project operational impacts can also be effectively managed by implementation of suitable engineering and management measures.The Khandwa water supply and Kolhapur waste water treatment projects will deliver significant environmental and community health benefits. The Khandwa project will provide a more reliable domestic water supply in terms of both volume and quality, thereby reducing the incidence of waterborne disease. The Kolhapur STP and allied works will improve sewage collection and provide additional sewage treatment capacity, safely treating sanitary effluent that currently poses a major health hazard and significantly degrades Panchganga water quality and the aquatic ecosystem, thereby improving social and environmental conditions in Kolhapur.","","","","",30859,"",BA - Water and Wastewater Utilities,"","","",""

The project also contemplates a possible geographical expansion with the penetration of other countries in the region.","","","","","","-Improved mobile and broadband access: Access is one of the 3 pillars of IFC''s telecoms strategy, is achieved through overall business efficiency thanks to the co-location model, as the telecoms ecosystem benefits from tower costs spread amongst multiple carriers, leading to improved access (coverage, prices, provision of additional services, etc.). The other pillars i.e. mainstreaming of private and public services and the fostering of innovation, are also achieved by a more efficient telecoms industry.    - Reduced capex and lowers operating costs: For telecoms operators, the reduced costs can translate into lower cost of services for users. Potentially, operators can unlock cash from their balance sheets (in the case existing towers are sold to independent third party operators), critical in a region like Central America, where financing options are scarce. - Telecom sector growth Infrastructure sharing is critical in further fuelling the evolution of the telecoms market, indirectly assisting in the development of mobile broadband, and more indirectly, content and applications, mobile finance and mobile advertising, as several industry segments begin converging. -Increased competition: co-location allows smaller operators to have access to a well managed network and they can quickly roll out their network and compete more effectively. - Environmental benefits become evident, especially in reducing the visual burden of the explosion in tower masts (i.e., as a result of mobile telephony markets with as many as 5 operators). - The Project also assists in the creation of both direct and indirect employment opportunities.","","","","","The key environmental and social issues associated with the project are the company''s environmental, health, safety, and social (EHSS) management;  EHSS screening of new sites;  construction at new sites;  labor and working conditions (including contractor occupational health and safety);  and pollution prevention and abatement.

The project will commence supplying 29 million L/day (MLD) to Khandwa (population 240,000) for domestic consumption, increasing to 43 MLD by the end of the concession period (2034), meeting the current shortfall by almost doubling the volume of water currently supplied. Under this build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) scheme Vishwa has a 25 year concession period (2 years construction, 23 years operation and maintenance). The project will pump water through an intake well on the Chhotitave River, a backwater of the Indira Sagar Reservoir, to the adjacent water treatment plant (WTP). The WTP (2.7 ha site) will treat water then pump it to Khandwa via a 50 km long 800 mm reinforced pipeline. The pipeline will discharge into a 1,222 m3 Ground Level Master Balancing Reservoir (GLMBR), from where it will be pumped to nine separate overhead tanks. Water will then be gravity fed to the township via a network of distribution pipelines. The project includes the laying of 60 km of poly distribution pipeline through the streets of Khandwa.

SPC was established in 1996 with the sole focus of developing grid-connected solar power projects. SPC will be both the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) and also the operation, maintenance and monitoring (O&MM) contractor for each of the two Companies. 

Each of the Companies is designed to produce 6 MWp using Polycrystalline silicon PV modules and Inverters. The Companies will sell power to Provincial Electricity Authority ('PEA')  a state owned power distribution company under Thailand's Very Small Power Producer renewable energy program.

The SPKR2 project site is located in Don Chomphu sub-district of Non Sung district in Nakhonratchasima province.  The total area required for this project is approximately 22 hectares.  The SPLO1 project site is in Ban Nong Nor sub-district, Wang Saphung district of Loei province.  The area required for this project is approximately 14.7 hectares. Both the sites have high levels of solar irradiation, so are suitable for PV installations, and have easy access to transmission lines and a main highway along their site boundaries.","","","","IFC's review of this investment considered Solar Power Company Limited's ('SPC' or the 'Sponsor') social, environmental, health and safety management systems; the identification and mitigation of social and environmental impacts on account of its proposed solar power projects; land acquisition for the proposed projects; community consultation and engagement; and labor working conditions including occupational health and safety. 

Accordingly, the review consisted of appraising technical, environmental and social information submitted by the Sponsor including: an Environmental Impact and Safety Assessment ('ESA') report for proposed projects in Korat and Loei, public hearing records, technical due diligence report for both the projects by independent engineer, applicable labor regulations and land purchase related data. The appraisal team also interviewed SPC's team in-charge of the proposed solar farms development. 

This is a repeat investment by IFC in the Company. The Environmental Social Review Summary (ESRS) for the previous IFC investment viz. Solar Power (Korat 1) Company Limited, (Project no. 28842), disclosed in March 2010, is available at:

This review therefore, builds upon the previously disclosed ESRS.","","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result, which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria. 

The key environmental and social aspects in the Project are the identification and mitigation of social and environmental impacts of the Companies; social, environmental, health and safety management systems; labor working conditions during construction and operation; pollution prevention and abatement during construction and operation; community health, safety and security;  and community consultation and engagement. 

Potential E&S impacts are mainly expected to be during the construction phase. These, besides being mitigable are likely to be limited to project sites; short term; and will likely not have any impact on environmentally sensitive areas. Further, it is possible to readily design and implement engineering and management measures to mitigate adverse impacts during construction and operations. 

SPC will manage its environmental and social performance in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations and international standards, including IFC's Performance Standards on Social and Environmental Sustainability.","","","","",30761,"",BF - Solar - Renewable Energy Generation,"","","",""

RVR is the operator of the Kenya-Uganda railway line which was privatized under two substantially identical 25-year concessions in 2006.  The RVR concession covers the existing railway networks of Kenya and Uganda with the main line running from the port of Mombasa on Kenyas coast through Nairobi to Kampala in Uganda, a distance of approximately 1,330 km.IFCs Corporate Advisory Services acted as a financial advisor to the Government of Kenya for the 2006 privatization and, at that time, IFC made available an A Loan of $22 mn and C Loan of $10 mn (project #24766).  Given the long distances involved (530 km from Mombasa to Nairobi and 803 km from there to Kampala), rail transportation should have a significant cost advantage over road transportation by trucks.  However, following decades of under-investment the network is in poor condition.  The Project is part of a larger restructuring and investment program to put the railway back onto a sustainable footing with the goal of increasing cargo volumes from about 1.6 mn tons currently to over 5.0 mn tons by 2020.IFCs proposed investment is an equity investment of up to $15 million.  This would be used towards the Project cost which is estimated to be about US$366.5 million.  In addition, the following institutions, among others, are considering investments in the operation:  DEG, FMO, Proparco, AfDB, and the IFC-African Latin American Fund.","","","","IFCs original review of the Rift Valley Railways (#24766) took place in 2006, the scope and results of which were made available on IFCs web site at that time (see link above).  Conducted in coordination with the World Bank (which is funding the retrenchment compensation of railway staff and the relocation of people who have encroached along the government-owned right-of-way), IFCs 2006 review relied upon visits, interviews with key staff, and documents prepared for the privatization and by the Project Sponsor.RVRs operations and facilities have subsequently been under continuous supervision by IFC, the most recent being visits conducted in September 2009 and September 2010.  Colleagues from the African Development Bank (AfDB), a potential new investor, also participated in the 2010 visit (see link to AfDBs website disclosure below).  This visit benefitted from the availability of an updated Environment, Health and Safety Audit (EHS Audit) carried out by the Companys consultant in 2010.  The September 2010 site visits incorporated key features of the railway network, including the main workshops, stations, rights-of-way, and encroachment areas around Mombasa, Nairobi (Kenya), Kampala and Jinja (Uganda).  A potential regional rail hub in Jinja was also visited.  The team met in Nairobi and Kampala with RVR management and with officials at the concessioning agencies, Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) and Uganda Railways Corporation (URC) involved in resettlement and compensation issues for the Project.Also as a result of the 2010 visit, two resettlement action plans (RAPs) were prepared on the encroachments on the railway reserve covering the conceded network in Uganda and the majority of the conceded network in Kenya outside of the irregular settlements of Kibera and Mukuru, near Nairobi.  The resettlement action plan for Kibera and Mukuru prepared for the government of Kenya in 2005 was never implemented because a decision was taken to expand the scope of the resettlement beyond the original 10.4 m operations corridor due to safety considerations.  Supported as part of the World Banks East Africa Trade and Transportation Facility Project (EATTFP), this updated RAP was prepared in 2010 to cover 50 m corridor in these two areas.  IFCs site visit in September 2010 also covered these areas, and IFC has reviewed the updated RAP.IFCs scope of review has focused on those impacts and risks within the areas conceded to RVR under the concession agreements in both countries.  These conceded assets include the existing workshops, the station areas, the 10.4 m operational corridor, and some, but not all rolling stock.","","","","","","","","","","","","The original 2006 IFC investment was categorized as B, which was consistent at the time with the World Banks categorization of its EATTFP project.  Involuntary resettlement, which was considered the main impact of the project, was limited to encroachment within the 10.4 m operational corridor identified in the concession agreements.  The social impact of the project has now expanded significantly as a result of the change in scope of the resettlement within Kibera and Mukuru irregular settlements and the additional encroachment that has taken place in other areas since 2006.  As a result, both IFC and the World Bank now consider this project to be Category A.","","","","",31102,"",AB - Rail Transportation,"","","",""

TTPP was originally planned as two separate 330 MW combined cycle combustion units. Takoradi 1 ('T1') has been operating in full combined cycle mode since 1999. This unit is owned and operated by the Takoradi Power Company ('TAPCO'), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Volta River Authority ('VRA'), a state owned and operated power utility company.  In 2000, the Takoradi International Company ('TICO' or the 'company'), which is about 90% owned by the Abu Dhabi National Energy Company ('TAQA') and 10% by VRA, completed construction and began operating the second combustion unit, Takoradi 2 ('T2'), at TTPP.   These units have been operating in simple cycle mode and TICO currently propose converting T2 to operate in combined cycle mode with the addition of a 110 MW steam turbine and generator (hereafter referred to as the 'T2 expansion').  This would increase the capacity of T2 to 330 MW, and that of TTPP from 550 MW to 660 MW.  

Key features of the T2 expansion include the addition of two heat recovery steam generators, a 110 MW steam turbine generator, two 60 m stacks and a seawater desalination plant.  In addition, a once through cooling water system will be installed to support operations at both T1 and T2 thereby removing reliance of T2 on freshwater.  The cooling system will include a sub-sea intake structure located 2.5 km offshore, intake conduits, onshore works including a pump house and intake and discharge chambers, and sub-sea outfall conduits and diffusers situated approximately 1.2 km offshore.  This final phase of T2 will increase the generating capacity of the facility without any additional fuel requirements.  The total project cost is approximately $325 million and IFC is considering a loan of up to $70 million to TICO to support the T2 expansion.   

T1 and T2 use either LCO or gas to generate power.  LCO is transferred to on-site storage tanks via a mooring buoy located some 4 km offshore.  Gas is supplied directly to site via an existing off-take pipeline from the West Africa Gas Pipeline ('WAGP'), a regional gas pipeline that supplies gas from Nigeria to Ghana, Benin and Togo.  VRA is responsible for the fuel supply, along with the treatment and storage of fuel, water and the treatment of waste water. 
 
All power generated at the site will be transferred off-site via existing transmission lines that have sufficient capacity to accommodate the additional energy to be generated by the T2 expansion.

In this manner, the plants power generation efficiency is increased by approximately a third, with no increase in greenhouse gas emissions.    TICO commissioned a recognized consulting company with experience in the power sector to undertake the requisite E&S assessments for the project.  This included an assessment for conversion of the facility from single to combined cycle, and a separate assessment for the cooling water system.  These assessments were completed in consultation with the Ghana Environmental Protection Agency and are generally compliant with IFCs requirements.  They also included stakeholder engagement with the surrounding communities with whom TICO has good working relationships and formalized communication structures.   In addition, TICO / VRA have a community impact agreement with the project affected communities which facilitates the provision of certain social amenities.     Key potential issues include air quality and noise and the predicted change to the current situation is not considered significant.  In addition, the cooling system has been designed to comply with IFC EHS Guidelines for Thermal Power Plants and upon operation, marine monitoring programs will be implemented to confirm environmental impacts are in accordance with those predicted. The company is currently in the process of implementing recognized, certifiable quality, environmental and occupational health and safety (OHS) systems with time schedule for this defined in the project Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP).   In addition, TICO has robust policies and procedures for the management of labor which are compliant with IFCs requirements.  This similarly applies to occupational health and safety (OHS) with the company operating for over 8 years without a lost-time accident.  A Construction Environmental and Social Management and Monitoring Plan (CESMMP) will be compiled for the on and offshore works to ensure effective management of E&S issues, including OHS, during this phase.  In addition, TICO has sufficient internal capacity and experience to ensure adequate implementation of the CESSMP.  Whist the company is currently in general compliance with IFCs Performance Standards, E&S performance will be further enhanced via implementation of the project ESAP.","","","","",30228,"",AD - Light Fuel Oil - Thermal Power Generation,"","","",""

Since the initial capitalization in 2002 with the Private Infrastructure Development Group 'PIDG' (a multi-donor organization formed by various European public development agencies)  as its sole equity investor and in response to a growing portfolio and financing needs of infrastructure projects in SSA, the Fund has undergone three rounds of additional funding reaching its current size of $600 million. IFC participated in the last round of financing closed in June 2010, committing a senior loan for $36.25 million and a standby liquidity facility for $12.5 million

The Project involves providing $150 million of net additional senior debt to EAIF in order to enable the Fund to invest in new projects through 2013.","","","","","","To close the infrastructure gap with other parts of the world, meet the Millennium Development Goals, and achieve national development targets in Africa within 10 years, an annual spending in infrastructure of US$93 billion (about 15 percent of the region's GDP) would be required. A funding gap equal to one third of this amount exists and the magnitude of the required investments places a premium on maximizing private sector investment flows that the proposed IFC investment will support.

The development impact of the project will be captured in terms of the Fund's performance, the Fund's additional investments in SSA infrastructure projects, the expansion of infrastructure capacity made available by project investments, the role of the Fund in extending appropriate environmental and social standards and the quality of those investments as follows: (i) Net Internal Rate of Return; (ii) Private sector involvement in infrastructure; (iii) Percentage of underlying investments with steady cash flows; (iv) Total infrastructure capacity (e.g. electricity generated, volume of export/import handled by a port etc.).","","","","","This second category FI investment in the Fund will not involve any material change in the way environmental and social risks are to be managed under the existing investment.

PIDG's objective is to encourage private infrastructure investment in developing countries that contributes to economic growth and poverty reduction. Since its establishment, the PIDG has developed project development facilities focused on improving project development and execution (InfraCo and DevCo) and project financing vehicles (GuarantCo and EAIF), aimed at addressing financial market failures that have created constraints to private investment in infrastructure service provision. GuarantCo which provides local currency guarantees to infrastructure projects in low-income countries to mitigate credit risks for local lenders is also managed by EAIF's fund manager. 
PIDG's current members include: the UK Department for International Development ('DFID'), the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs ('SECO'), the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs ('DGIS'), the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency ('SIDA'), the Austrian Development Agency ('ADA'), Irish Aid and the World Bank.

The SSP plant will process beneficiated rock and is expected to produce 500,000 metric tons of SSP fertilizer per annum which will be sold to farmers and fertilizer distributors in the nearby and expanding agricultural region of the Cerrado.","","","","","","The project will support the further intensification and expansion of agricultural production in North Eastern Brazil, the Cerrado, by making available SSP fertilizer closer to market. Given Brazil's already important role in supplying global agricultural markets and its significant potential for converting soil into arable land, the further development of the Cerrado plays an important role in promoting global food security, to which this project is making a contribution.

Specifically, the expected development benefits from the project will be in the form of:
Development of regional fertilizer capacity in a growing market that relies on imports and domestic supply from producers which are located at a distance.  Greater production and supply of SSP in the region supports the expansion and intensification of agricultural production and creates some degree of independence from imports with the positive effects overall of reduced transportation lag times and lower price volatility.
Expansion and intensification of agricultural production in the Cerrado, which has become the breadbasket of Brazil. Further intensification and expansion of agricultural activity depends on the availability of Single Super Phosphate ('SSP'), a source of sulfur and key ingredient to turning the sulfur deficient soils of the Cerrado into arable land.
Job creation in an isolated area in the poorer northeast of Brazil with few economic opportunities.

Limited,"Gbl Ind, Manufact, Agribus & Services",2011-06-29T04:00:00Z,"",A,Other,"IFC is considering a corporate investment to provide a $50 million C Loan to Ecom. This would allow the Company to (i) increase the amount of working capital financing it can borrow to expand its operations or sustain volumes during periods of high commodity prices, (ii) provide further capital to cover unexpected financial needs; and (iii) support Ecom's internal financing needs to further maintain and grow its business (e.g. risk management systems, sustainability initiatives, provision of technical and financial services to farmers). By supporting Ecom through long-term quasi-equity financing, IFC would help the Company continue to further implement its sustainability business plan, improve its corporate and supply chain E&S performance, through increasing traceability of commodities, developing regional/country level data integrating knowledge of child or forced labor and natural/critical habitat to monitor supply chain and focus efforts to promote productivity intensification in areas with identified risks, and adopting agro-commodity voluntary standards in the cocoa and cotton sectors.

The Ecom Group's diverse operations involve trading and processing of agro-commodities including coffee, cotton and cocoa. Trading operations worldwide place ECOM 3rd in coffee, 5th in cotton, and 7th in cocoa, and has long-established relationships with top multinational buyers, such as Mars, Nestle, Starbucks, Sara Lee, Kraft, and Hershey. 

With regard to physical assets associated with processing, Ecom operates 25 coffee wet mills worldwide, 2 cocoa processing plants in The Netherlands, and Mexico, cotton gins in Mexico and Paraguay, and will operate a cotton gin to be built in Tajikistan. Other traded products, are grains, rape, and sunseed. Ecom operates an oilseed crushing factory in Paraguay. Ecom has a non consolidated investment in hog farms operating under the name of Granjas Carroll in Mexico (GCM), however Ecom does not trade hogs as such. GCM has been awarded the certification of Empresa Socialmente Responable' (Socially Responsible Enterprise) for four years in a row.

One of Ecom's core strategies is to procure as directly as possible from farmers. Ecom views the sustainability of the farmers who supply to the Company as critical to its own success. Ecom's goal of buying directly from farmers and adding value to their productionin terms of improved quantity, quality and farmer incomeis aligned with the farmer's and IFC's developmental interest. In terms of development impact, IFC's current projects with Ecom reached a total of 121,280 coffee farmers worldwide.","","","","The scope of review of this corporate investment to Ecom (or the 'Company') included site visits to Ecom headquarters in Pully, Switzerland, and at field operations in Tajikistan. IFC's environmental and social review included the assessment of Company's technical documentation, regarding environmental, occupational health and safety, labor, and social performance and its supply chain (coffee, cocoa, and cotton). Further information on the Environmental and Social (E&S) risks associated with the supply chain of some of the commodities (coffee, cocoa, cotton) traded by Ecom was obtained at ILO and UNICEF websites, and through IFC's custom-made reports from recognized environmental and social consultancy firms. The due diligence of IFC environmental and social development specialists for this investment also benefited from a range of commodities' related activities, namely: a) participation to the World Cocoa Foundation Partnership Meeting in October 2010 where the need for engagement in a collaborative program with existing sustainability interventions to address social, environmental and productivity issues was recommended; b) establishment of a team of IFC's E&S specialists and investment officers to further define supply chain E&S issues and IFC Sustainability Performance Standard requirements to address investments for traders; c) preparation of an E&S sector risk analysis for cocoa production in West Africa and for cotton production in Central Asia; d) pro-active coordination with World Bank, Unicef, and IFC Advisory Services to address country, sector, and project level E&S issues.","","","","","","","","","","","","E & S Categorization Rationale: 

While the existing investments of IFC in Ecom for the coffee sector have limited E&S impacts, IFC is treating this corporate investment as a Category A project, according to its Environmental and Social Review Procedures. The rational underlying this categorization is based on the well documented significant adverse social or environmental issues related to cocoa in West Africa and cotton in Central Asia, as described in PS2 (child labor) and PS 6 (deforestation), and the associated E&S residual risks given the supply chain dynamics. In such category A investment, IFC will continue to monitor the implementation of Ecom's procurement policy, and how Ecom is making use of its social and environmental management system to ensure the inclusion of E&S issues into its supply chain management system, and that ultimately guarantee that the company's operations are consistent with IFC Performance Standards and World Bank Group Environmental, Health and Safety General Guidelines (WBG General EHS Guidelines) to avoid and mitigate impacts, and monitor progress in establishing better E&S practices across its supply chain. Despite this provision, it is likely that Ecom's ability to manage their supply chain in some geographical areas will be challenging, and that there will be instances of child labor at suppliers fields that will not be consistent with PS2.","","","","",30789,"","AD - Coffee, Cocoa, Tea","","","",""

Simandou III,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Africa,Guinea,RIO TINTO SIMFER SA,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2011-08-09T04:00:00Z,2011-10-18T04:00:00Z,A,Loan,"The Simandou iron ore project is located in South-east Guinea, approximately 600km from the Guinean coast.  The current phase of the project (the Project or Simandou III) entails the completion of a Preliminary Engineering Assessment (PEA), Definitive Engineering (DE), early construction works and advance ordering of long lead items at an estimated expenditure of more than $3.5 billion over the next eighteen months, and culminating in the formal decision to proceed with the full development of the operation (Decision to Mine).  A large high grade iron ore resource has been delineated and is expected to support a 95Mtpa mining operation for over thirty years.  Development of the mining operation would include development of new rail and port infrastructure to export the ore.  This infrastructure component is expected to account for around two-thirds of the total cost of the Simandou iron ore project.","","","","","","Economic transformation for Guinea: At full production the Simandou iron ore project will be the largest mining and commercial project in the country and will make a large direct positive contribution to Guinea''s economy for decades. Annual taxes and royalties to the Government of Guinea have the potential, at full production and after tax holiday, to exceed US$1 billion p.a. (subject to iron ore prices) and will directly employ over 4,000 Guineans.Infrastructure development:  The Simandou infrastructure, particularly the rail, will open up the east of the country to new private sector development opportunities. Simfer has committed to the provision of a multi-use/multi-user facility, which will include passenger rail services.  The construction of the rail will also require the construction of a feeder road network along its alignment, further facilitating local movement and trade.  Emerging sustainable mining sector:  Guinea is an emerging iron ore producer and, based on its resource endowment, is expected to become one of the main global producers in the coming years. The Simandou iron ore project will be the first of several large projects and will set key benchmarks going forward in terms of standards of operation and E&S management.  In addition, Simandou''s infrastructure could in the future potentially be shared on a commercial basis with other emerging iron ore operations in the region.Community development:  Simfer will spend a minimum of 0.25% of project revenues on socioeconomic activities in affected prefectures (particularly Beyla and Forecariah), including investments in electricity, roads, water and sanitation, communication, and health and education.","","","","","While the IFC environmental and social categorization when IFC made its first investment in 2006 (i.e. Simandou I and II) was a B, consistent with the very early stage nature of the project at that time, this categorization has now been revised to A, on the basis that a proportion of the investments planned during Simandou III (through to Decision to Mine) will include initial development activities, including early construction works.The main E&S issues identified at this stage are: 1) biodiversity, 2) in-migration and 3) water usage. Numerous biodiversity studies have been completed (by Simfer and several reputable international consultants) for the mine site areas and similar studies will be undertaken for the rail and port sites. The mine site areas include various levels of protected forest, which are rich in biodiversity, and inter alia include endangered species, including West African chimpanzees.Significant in-migration has already occurred in towns and villages near Simandou (particularly Traorela, Beyla and Moribadou) and is expected to increase as the project progresses.  Studies to understand the in-migration dynamics have been completed and a number of activities have started as a result, including village planning for Moribadou and employment information centres. The Simandou mountain range is part of a key watershed at the head of a complex hydrographic system feeding the Niger and other important regional river systems.  A number of hydrological and climatological studies have been completed to assess potential impacts of mining at Simandou and a strategic plan to manage those impacts is in progress.Finally, although the precise alignment of the rail and location of the port are yet to be finalized, there may be as many as 2,000 economically or physically displaced households along the infrastructure corridor.  Simfer is committed to implementing the Simandou iron ore project in accordance with international best practices and IFCs Performance Standards.More details regarding the above can be found in the current Environmental and Social Review Summary (ESRS).GovernanceGovernance in Guinea has historically been weak.  In 2010 Transparency International ranked the country 164th of 178 countries and the World Banks Ease of Doing Business ranked Guinea 179th of 183.  Nonetheless, following successful Presidential elections in November 2010, the Government of Guinea has continued to show a strong commitment to strengthening governance and ensuring the country derives greater benefits from the mining sector.  The country has embarked on a process of reform that includes a review of all existing mining concessions. In this regard, the Government recently completed the review of the Simandou concession culminating in a revision of the convention terms.  Guinea has made an important stride forward by reaching out to the IMF regarding the management of the $700 million settlement sum (equivalent to approximately 15% of GDP) received under the revised convention terms. On transparency, Guinea became an EITI candidate country in 2007 but was (voluntarily) suspended in 2009 due to the political unrest in the country.  This suspension was lifted in March 2011 and Guinea has until mid-2012 to complete EITI Validation.  The country appears to be moving in the right direction and with the wide support of the international community following the recent advent of democracy, it is expected to complete the EITI validation process and to continue strengthen its governance structures.  Guinea is already working closely with the IMF and the World Bank on reaching Completion Point under HIPC.  Decision Point was achieved in 2000 when it was confirmed that around $2 billion in debt (of $3 billion) would be written off subject to meeting certain criteria on fiscal management and stability.  The success of a world class project such as Simandou will reinforce this reform process. For its part, Simfer recognizes that good corporate governance and transparency in the sector will enhance the developmental impact of the Simandou iron ore project and, in line with IFC requirements, will continue to disclose publicly all material payments made in the form of taxes, royalties, and fees to the Government.","The mining concession holder and project company is Simfer SA, which is owned 95% by Rio Tinto plc and 5% by IFC.  The Government of Guinea has a right to acquire up to a 35% interest in Simfer (under various option arrangements) and a 51% fully funded interest in the related Simandou infrastructure (port and rail).  Subject to satisfaction of certain completion requirements, Chalco (a subsidiary of Chinalco, a multinational Chinese state-backed holding company) will have an indirect participation in Simfer through a joint venture agreement with Rio Tinto plc. Rio Tinto plc is a diversified multinational mining and resources group with headquarters in London and Melbourne. It is the worlds largest bauxite, alumina and aluminum producer and second largest iron ore producer. It is an industry leader in sustainable mining and leads numerous mining sector initiatives on conservation, land rehabilitation, biodiversity, climate change and water and energy use.  Rio Tinto plc is listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Australian Securities Exchange.","The total project cost for Simandou III (through to Decision to Mine) is currently forecast at in excess of $3.5 billion.  This amount includes the $700 million settlement sum (as agreed in the agreement recently signed between Simfer and the Government of Guinea, announced by Rio Tinto plc on 22 April 2011), technical studies and resource definition drilling through to the completion of the PEA and DE, as well as long lead item orders and early construction works.  The long lead item orders and early construction works will be necessary during this period in order to achieve the targeted first exported production deadline of June 2015. IFC is seeking board approval to invest an additional $150 million of equity in Simfer to contribute towards achieving the Decision to Mine milestone at the end of 2012.  IFC African, Latin American and Caribbean Fund, managed by IFC Asset Management Company LLC, may at a date yet to be determined participate in this investment.

The complex is being constructed by Progimmo, a real estate holding company, owned by Mr. Edourard Hicintuka and his family.  Mr. Hicintuka is a Burundian businessman who has previously been involved in real estate developments in Burundi and is the largest importer and trader in fertilizer in the country.  

The site is 8,250 m2 and located on Avenue du Large within a new, low density and rise mixed use area (commercial, office, hotels) 2 km from Bujumbura's central business district, and some 100 m from the edge of Lake Tanganyika.  The complex will consist of two separate, yet similar, four storey office blocks with a total lettable area of about 7,000 m2.  Once complete, tenants would then be responsible for the final layout of the area being let.  Currently there are no construction activities on site, however the foundation for the office building on the site's northern boundary has been constructed, along with the first floor of the building.   This building is located at 90 degrees to the Lake and the second building will be located on the site's southern boundary.  The final orientation for this building is yet to be confirmed however, as opposed to being at 90° to the Lake, it may be angled so as to take advantage of the views afforded by the Lake.  

The remaining areas of the site will be occupied by parking for approximately 200 vehicles and landscaped gardens, though the latter will be limited due to space constraints.   There is a road on the site's eastern boundary between the site and the Lake, Avenue du Large forms the site's western boundary, to the south is an access road and further in this direction is a hotel, whist to the north is a vacant site.  The general area is characterized by commercial developments under varying stages of construction and the access roads are yet to be asphalted.  

The total project cost is approximately $8.7 million and IFC is considering a loan of up to $3.5 million, with Progimmo providing the remaining funds.","","","","IFC's appraisal for this project consisted of a site visit attended by the municipal representatives including the Directors of Planning, Water Supply and Sanitation and Waste Management.

To sustain and improve the gains achieved so far, the Company anticipates additional capital expenditure of up to $450 million over the next 5 years expected to be funded from internal cash generation as well as external resources, e.g. the World Bank, other multilateral agencies, Government of Kenya (GoK), IFC and commercial banks loans.

The World Bank''s Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic found that the lack of adequate, reliable electricity supply is Kenya''s largest infrastructure challenge and a key constraint to growth. Unreliable electricity supply in recent years has led to an estimated economic losses of up to 2% of GDP or approximately 7% of the annual revenues of Kenyan firms, higher than that in other countries of similar economic development. Interruptions in electricity supply stem mainly from inadequate generation capacity and weak transmission and distribution networks, particularly in areas of high growth in electricity demand.","","","","","The Project involves the modernization, upgrading and expansion of existing electrical distribution infrastructure, thus this is a Category B project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

AFEs plan is to develop a nickel mine and concentrating plant at Dutwa and to export its product to international markets.AFE is seeking an equity investment from IFC to help finance the ongoing Dutwa feasibility study.

There has therefore been limited need for African Eagle to construct new access roads.  The key environmental and social issues associated with the exploration drilling currently ongoing in Dutwa are: (i) management of exploration activities (specifically rehabilitation of the drill roads, and drill sites, safe disposal of oils, proper solid waste management, water and effluent management at the proposed exploration campsite); (ii) occupational health and safety; (iii) handling of hazardous materials, principally fuel; (iv) public safety and emergency preparedness & response; (v) temporary use of small fractions of communal land for drill pads, that has limited impacts on community use of the land  livestock grazing, collection of firewood and medical plants; (vi) community safety resulting from increase in vehicular traffic; (vii) potential project-induced in-migration and influx of job seekers and small scale service providers; (viii) adequate consultation with the potentially affected communities to manage expectations vis-à-vis potential project benefits, community development programs and understanding of mining activities; and (ix) implementation of appropriate control measures (eg. screening, for prevention of communicable disease transmission).To address the above identified issues and meet the requirements of IFCs Performance Standards, AFE has committed to an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) covering its exploration activities, feasibility and potential future mine development.Any IFC investment in potential future mine development undertaken by the company will be assessed as a new project and its categorization would be determined after the necessary due diligence.

IFCs main interest is the Companys Dutwa nickel laterite project located in north-central Tanzania, approximately 100km east of Mwanza and 1100km northwest of Dar es Salaam, near Dutwa, a large village and administrative centre within Bariadi District.A total IFC equity investment of around 3.1 Great British pounds (approximately $5.0 million) is proposed to contribute to the financing of the Bankable Feasibility Study (BFS) of the project and for other corporate purposes. AFE has commissioned baseline studies which will lead to the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) as part of the BFS. The baseline studies will commence in November 2011 and the consultants are currently finalising the scope of work for the studies. IFC will assist AFE in reviewing the scope of work to ensure that the company can develop the project in line with international best practice in environmental and social sustainability. This Environmental and Social Review Summary (ESRS) covers AFEs activities at the early exploration stage including feasibility studies.","","","","IFCs review of the Dutwa project consisted of a three-day appraisal visit conducted in April 2011 to assess the Companys operations, review environmental, health, safety, and social information submitted by the Company and understand their plans and commitments for the future development of the prospect. The trip to site was undertaken by road to gain an impression of the logistics challenges related to raw materials and product transportation should the project proceed to development. In addition, as part of the preliminary logistics assessment, a jetty on Lake Victoria in the fishing village of Nyamikoma was also visited. Whilst in its early stages, the project could also draw water from this point. A potential groundwater abstraction area on the Duma River was also visited to gain an appreciation of potential water sources the company could consider for production.The project area lies thirty to forty km west of the Serengeti National Park; to determine the possibility of adverse impacts on the Park, the IFC team drove east along a gravel road which runs from Dutwa towards the Park and also to the Ndabaka Gate of the Park on the main Mwanza to Musoma trunk road. The gravel road ends approximately 7  10 km from the Maswa Game Reserve which forms a buffer zone between Serengeti National Park and the surrounding communities. The land outside the Park is settled and used for agriculture (crops and animal husbandry  cattle, sheep and goats), and there was no evidence of wildlife migratory routes in this area.Meetings were held with representatives of the community at Dutwa, the Director of Environment and senior representatives of Bollore Africa Logistics in Dar es Salaam. The communitys views on the exploration project were discussed including the communitys interactions with the Company to date. The purpose of the meeting with the Director of Environment was to engage with the relevant central government authorities at an early stage of the investment to solicit their views on the project and understand the directorate sector general views on environmental issues and their management. The meeting with Bollore Africa Logistics sought to strengthen the teams appreciation of logistics related issues in Tanzania including hazardous materials transportation and associated spill, emergency preparedness and response plan requirements. The meeting also touched on Lake Victoria Barging as a potential option for transfer of both raw materials and finished product should the project progress to development.","","","","","","","","","","","","This is a category B project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure because the Environmental, Health & Safety, and Social (EHSS) impacts of the project are limited, site specific and therefore manageable through implementation of appropriate mitigation measures. IFCs categorization of this project is based on the impacts of exploration activities, which currently have a small footprint. The drilling activity is focused on the two target hills - Wamangola and Ngasamo. The hills, whilst fairly preserved, already have access roads that were developed by Telecom companies for the base stations that are currently on the hills. There has therefore been limited need for African Eagle to construct new access roads.  There is currently no exploration campsite as the African Eagle staff resides in rented accommodation in Dutwa village. The key environmental and social issues associated with the exploration drilling currently ongoing in Dutwa are: (i) management of exploration activities (specifically rehabilitation of the drill roads, and drill sites, safe disposal of oils, proper solid waste management, water and effluent management at the proposed exploration campsite); (ii) occupational health and safety; (iii) handling of hazardous materials (e.g. fuel); (iv) public safety and emergency preparedness & response; (v) temporary use of small fractions of communal land for drill pads, that has limited impacts on community use of the land  livestock grazing, collection of firewood and medical plants; (vi) community safety resulting from increase in vehicular traffic; (vii) potential project-induced in-migration and influx of job seekers and small scale service providers; (viii) adequate consultation with the potentially affected communities to manage expectations vis-à-vis potential project benefits, community development programs and understanding of mining activities; and (ix) implementation of appropriate control measures (screening, for prevention of communicable disease transmission).Any IFC investment in potential future mine development undertaken by the company will be assessed as a new project and its categorization would be determined after the necessary due diligence.

Samas primary asset is an option to earn a 60% stake in the Samapleu polymetallic project (Samapleu or the Project) in Côte dIvoire.   The Project is relatively early on the development curve, but has the potential to host multiple deposits given its location in a new and prospective district in Côte DIvoire.   Samas strategy is to first build a small operation to produce nickel and copper concentrate based on an initial resource of 10 to 15 million tonnes. They would then use the cash flow to scale up their operation based on the discovery of additional resources.  Sama also has a grassroots exploration project (Lola) in Guinea, but the Companys focus is on the development of Samapleu in Côte dIvoire, where IFCs proceeds will be spent.","","","","","","This is an early-stage, exploration project in a post-conflict, IDA country which is set to attract investment to develop its mineral resource sector.   During exploration and prior to commercial resource discovery, the Project will have limited, immediate development impact.  Nonetheless, even at its early stage, the Project provides local permanent employment to 35 people in an area with no formal employment opportunities and poverty levels of 80%.   Should exploration lead to mine development and production, the developmental impacts will be notable.   Key expected benefits will include taxes and other payments to government, the generation of direct employment and indirect jobs through linkages into the community as well as the improvement of local transportation and other infrastructure that will support local economic development.   Successful resource discovery and development are also likely to attract more foreign investment into the sector.","","Governance is weak in the country, as captured by various governance metrics, including the World Bank Governance Indicators and Transparency International.   However, given the early stage nature of the project and the limited benefits to be generated at this point, especially in terms of fiscal revenues, any potential governance risks to them are deemed limited.   In addition, the current Government is actively engaged with the WBG to further improve governance and transparency of the sector, including a renewed commitment to successful EITI implementation.  Côte dIvoire is expected to become EITI compliant in 2012.

The growth capital provided by IFC and its co-investors is to be used for: i) the expansion of MPIs existing gas plants from simple-cycle to combined-cycle, thereby improving their efficiency; ii) developing small scale hydro projects; and iii) new gas fired power projects.","","","","","","The Project is expected to have the following developmental impacts:a) Climate Change Mitigation: The Project is expected to displace coal and oil fired power generation that would otherwise be developed and to have demonstration effect in facilitating the development of small-to medium -sized domestic IPPs using domestic gas or hydro resources, a market segment that has been under-served thus far. b) Private Sector Development: The Project would also have a demonstration effect in facilitating the development of local IPP players, in a market that remains dominated by foreign IPP investors. The development of local players is important in supporting the growth of a competitive IPP market and would further broaden the local private-sector base.c) Infrastructure Development: The Project is expected to add power generating capacity for over one million people, a substantial number in a country where approximately 1/3 of the population lives without regular access to the electricity network.d) Rural Development & Employment: Investments in small scale hydropower projects are expected to stimulate job creation and economic growth in rural communities.e) Taxes: The project is expected to increase the tax base of the Government of Indonesia.","","","","","Existing gas-fired thermal power assets are considered to have limited environmental and social impacts.  MPIs medium-term growth strategy is focused toward the development of additional gas fired power generation on Batam Island, Indonesia, and the development of small hydro (less than 10MW per asset) power activities, which are expected to have limited environmental and social impacts.

(Candax or the Company) is a junior oil and gas company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange with assets in Tunisia. IFC is considering an equity investment of up to CA$24 million in Candax to be used in order to finance its investment program which aims to enhance production from its mature asset base, consisting of (1) the operational shallow water offshore field El-Bibane, (2) the operational onshore fields Ezzaouia and Robbana, and (3) two additional shut-in onshore fields Al-Manzah and Belli (the Project). Candax is the operator of the El-Bibane, Robbana and Al-Manzah fields whereas Maretap, an equal partnership between Candax and the Tunisian national oil company ETAP, operates the Ezzaouia and Belli fields. The Companys current production volume averages around 320 barrels of oil per day. Assets in Tunisia include:El-Bibane (73.8% working interest): Candax is the field operator.  The field consists of three offshore unmanned well tower platforms, some 18 km offshore of Zarzis, south east Tunisia in the Gulf of Gabes in water depths of 7 m.  Current production of liquids is from one well, one well is shut-in and the third well is used for gas injection for the optimization of reservoir liquid recovery.  Liquids are sent to a central processing facility based in the industrial area of Zarzis port via an 8 subsea pipeline.  Processed oil is transferred to a terminal operated by Maretap (a 50/50 joint venture between the Candax subsidiary, Ecumed and the Tunisian state owned oil company, ETAP) for export.  The terminal is adjacent to the central processing facility.  Final export is by ship from the Zarzis port.  High pressure gas separated at the El-Bibane processing facility is recycled and sent back offshore for gas lift via a subsea 6 pipeline.Ezzaouia (31.4% working interest): Maretap is the field operator.  An onshore field with 13 wells of which currently six are producing.  Liquids are transferred to a central processing facility approximately 12 km north of Zarzis.  Processed oil is transferred via a 10 pipeline to the Maretap terminal adjacent to the El-Bibane central processing facility.Robbana (80% working interest): Candax is the field operator.  An onshore field located on the island of Djerba and consisting of one well with minimal above ground support facilities.  Production resumed in early August 2011.Al-Manzah (75% working interest): Candax is the field operator.  An onshore field located approximately 60 km from Tunis.  The field was shut-in in 2007.Belli (50% working interest): Maretap is the field operator.  An onshore field located adjacent to Al-Manzah.  The field was shut-in in 1999.  This investment is limited to these assets. Potential future work programs in Tunisia may include implementation of a waterflood program in the Robbana field, well work-overs and sidetrack drilling in the El-Bibane, Ezzaouia and Robbana fields and a 3D seismic acquisition campaign at El-Bibane.","","","","IFCs environmental and social (E&S) review of this proposed investment consisted of appraising technical and health, safety and environment (HSE) information submitted by the Company. Key documentation included: the HSE management system manual containing the Companys HSE Policy, standards, procedures and instructions in relation to HSE management and control of the Companys activities in Tunisia, various environmental impact assessments conducted for Candax activities in Tunisia, the oil spill contingency plan for the El-Bibane field, emergency response procedures, health and safety reports and the Companys personnel policy handbook.During the review, the IFC team, including an environmental specialist, met Candax management and operational staff in Paris and Tunis and visited current operations in Tunisia.  These visits included the El-Bibane offshore field and onshore central processing facilities in Zarzis, the SEEB power plant at Zarzis, the Ezzaouia central processing facilities north of Zarzis, the oil storage and export terminal adjacent to El-Bibane, well intervention activities at Ezzaouia and, the Robbana field on the island of Djerba. Existing field activities and operations as well as facilities, equipment and infrastructure were assessed during the field visits.","","","","","","","","","","","","The Project has been assessed as an E&S Category B investment.  Category B projects according to IFCs E&S Review Procedure are those that result in a limited number of specific E&S impacts that can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to industry recognized standards, guidelines and design criteria.  Key findings of the appraisal that defined categorization included:The scope of the Project covers a small footprint of existing brownfield assets. Candax operations are small-scale, pre-existing and potential E&S impacts and risks are typical for small-scale oil and gas activities.  Impacts and risk can be readily identified and avoided or reduced by following good international industry practice.  Candax has a strong commitment to effective E&S management and have a comprehensive HSE management system in place.  Adherence to good international industry practice is achieved through the implementation of the standards and internationally recognized procedures contained within the management system and the system will be further strengthened through the adoption and integration with IFC Performance Standards and EHS Guidelines.Existing central processing facilities at the El-Bibane and Ezzaouia fields are well established.  The El-Bibane facility started operations in 1998 and is located within the industrial area of the Zarzis port zone.  First oil at the Ezzaouia facility was back in 1991 and the facility is located in a rural environment north of Zarzis.  There will be no need to increase the existing facility footprints at either of these facilities as the existing supporting infrastructure is adequate and any processing upgrades or alterations required will take place within the existing fence-line.  Candaxs onshore assets Al-Manzah and Belli are all not producing at present, whereas production at Robbana resumed in August 2011. All have been in place for many years and are small sites consisting of minimal above ground facilities and located in remote agricultural areas.  Current future plans indicate that increases to Candaxs onshore footprint including around the onshore wells for Ezzaouia will be limited. The offshore footprint is insignificant consisting of three small unmanned tower platforms in shallow water (7m) and two subsea pipelines.  There are no production processes carried out at these platforms and no effluent discharges.  All drilling wastes are collected and brought to shore for disposal.  There are no fishing activities specific to the offshore platform area. The offshore wells and pipelines are designed to avoid accidents that may result in oil spills to sea through the implementation of internationally accepted oil spill prevention measures that are regularly tested and maintained.  In the unlikely event of a spill, Candax has regularly practiced oil spill response arrangements and procedures in place to contain and respond to potential spill risks.Future activities can be assessed on a case by case basis before the activities begin and E&S management measures commensurate with the identified impacts and risks can be readily developed and implemented where necessary.","","","","",30647,"",AB - Oil and Gas Production (Includes Development),"","","",""

In order to finance the Companys investment program, in 2008 each of IFC and EBRD provided a long term loan of  35 million (IFCs project number #26093). The loans will be repaid in 18 equal installments that started in July 2011 and will be ending in January 2020.In line with the EU Energy Policy, following the new Energy Law that was enacted in February 2011 and the new secondary regulation, EVN Macedonia and the Macedonian energy market is going through a major reform and liberalization process. Due to the ongoing unbundling of its distribution, supply and generation businesses and the changes to market mechanics the Company is expected to require additional working capital by the beginning of 2012.  In order to finance this working capital need and capital expenditures of the Company IFC will provide a long term loan up to  7 million.  EBRD also considers participating in the financing.  If EBRD decides to participate, the IFC loan amount will be reduced to  3.5 million.The Companys capital expenditure includes items for high voltage lines, substations, low and medium voltage lines, connections to customers, transformers, meters, telecommunications, and some generation (investment in a new small hydropower project of 1.1MW in 2012).  The potential environmental or social impacts of these items are similar to those supported by IFCs previous investment made in the Company in 2008.  The main business of the Company is electricity distribution with about 26,360 km distribution lines.  The Company has 11 small hydropower plants (in total 46MW capacity).","","","","This is a repeat investment for an original project (ESM Macedonia # 26093) that was appraised in 2007 and committed in 2008.  The original project was the loan financing of an investment program to upgrade Macedonias electricity supply and distribution company, Electropanstvo na Makedonija AD (ESM) which was privatized in April 2006 and was acquired by EVN, Austrias second largest power utility.  ESM is now called EVN Macedonia AD (EVN Macedonia or the Company).  After IFCs investment in the Company, IFC has conducted periodic and ongoing supervision of the Companys environmental, health and safety and social performance by reviewing Annual Monitoring reports for the year 2008, 2009 and 2010.  In addition, IFC conducted a regular environmental supervision visit in March 2011.  The appraisal of this new investment in the Company was conducted by a desk review of the accumulated and updated information about the Companys environmental and social performance obtained through IFCs supervision activities as described above.","","","","","","","","","","","","Because it primarily involves the modernization and upgrading of aging electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure that is already in place, this repeat category B investment will not result in any material change in the management of limited environmental and social risks.  New investment activities also include constructing and operating a relatively small-scale hydro power facility in confined (and already disturbed) areas by an existing IFC client who has demonstrated it can effectively operate similar facilities.

IFCs environmental and social review included the assessment of the Companys technical documentation regarding environmental, occupational health and safety, labor, and social performance of its direct operations and of its most relevant supply chains (coffee, cocoa, and sugar). Further information on the Environmental and Social (E&S) risks associated with the supply chain of key commodities (coffee, cocoa, sugar) traded by Armajaro was obtained from ILO and UNICEF websites, and through third party reports from a recognized environmental and social consultancy firm responding to IFC criteria. The due diligence of IFC environmental and social development specialists for this investment also benefited from a range of commodities related activities including participation in the World Cocoa Foundation Partnership Meeting in October 2010 where the need for engagement in a collaborative program with existing sustainability interventions to address social, environmental and productivity issues was recommended as well as  ongoing work by a team of IFC E&S specialists and investment officers to further define supply chain E&S issues and IFC Performance Standard requirements to address investments for traders.","","","","","","","","","","","","IFC has categorized this corporate investment as a Category A project, according to its Policy on Social and Environmental Sustainability. The rationale underlying this categorization is based on the well documented significant adverse social or environmental issues related to cocoa farming in West Africa, as described in PS2 (child labor) and PS 6 (conversion of natural/critical habitats leading to biodiversity loss), and the associated E&S residual risks given the characteristics of the supply chain. In such an investment, where the environment and social risks are largely in the supply chains, IFC will monitor the implementation of Armajaros business strategy with respect to commodity traceability and certification, review how Armajaro is making use of its environmental and social management systems in its supply chain management efforts, and monitor the companys performance against IFC Performance Standards and World Bank Group (WBG) General Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines. Notwithstanding IFCs ongoing monitoring and Armajaros own commitments, Armajaros ability to manage aspects of their supply chain in some geographical areas will be challenging and there can be no absolute guarantee that harmful child labor will not be present at the supplier level.Armajaros own operations have environmental and social risks and impacts that are limited in number, site specific, and addressable through known technology and/or procedures.

Production levels from underground will be maintained during the transition from Block 4 to Block 5 by developing smaller sub-level caves within the Precursor ore body (adjacent to the main ore body) at Block 4 and within Block 5 itself. Petra foresees a long life for the operation and has a current mine plan of 18 years, though the ore body remains open-ended at depth.The Finsch capital expenditure over the next six years for the underground and infrastructure development program is estimated to be approximately $330 million and is expected to be financed by a combination of debt and internal cash generation. The proposed revolving loan facility will allow Petra to fully fund the projected capital expenditure programs for the next two years and withstand unfavorable variations in cash flows.","","","","","","A strategic priority of South Africa's Medium Term Strategic Framework (2009-2014) is the creation of employment opportunities. The framework also specifically recognizes the economic contributions from mineral extraction and processing, and the need for support for continued expansion in the sector. The Finsch expansion, which contemplates the long-term and economic sustainability of a 44-year old mine, will support this government objective, by increasing production from 1.5 Mcts per annum to 2 Mcts per annum and extending the mine life from three to 18 years, thereby promoting sustainable development in a frontier region of South Africa. More specifically, the development impact from the Finsch expansion is expected to include:(i) Employment: Successful implementation of the Finsch expansion will help maintain the aggregate number of direct and indirect jobs and potentially create opportunities for further employment.(ii) Fiscal Contributions: Petra anticipates Finsch to start generating royalty payments immediately and become a tax paying entity by 2014. As per IFC requirements, Petra has agreed to publicly disclose all material revenue payments made to the South African government.(iii) Community Development: Finsch already contributes directly towards community development through the provisioning of social, commercial and industrial infrastructures.(iv) Support to Local SMEs: A large proportion of Finsch's procurement is expected to be from South African suppliers, of which a significant percentage is expected to be from local and regional suppliers. Finsch is committed to supplier development and training, and expects to allocate a portion of its community development expenditure to such initiatives.","","","","","Petra is an existing IFC client with good environmental and social performance.

Finsch,Investment,Environmental Documents,Completed,Africa,South Africa,PETRA DIAMONDS LIMITED,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2012-01-25T22:32:30Z,"",B,Other,"The project entails an IFC revolving loan to Finsch Diamond Mine in South Africa (Finsch), which is 74% owned by Petra Diamonds Limited (Petra). The financing, that will be provided jointly by IFC and a South African Bank (Rand Merchant Bank), will enable Petra to: finance the Finsch mine expansion program; strengthen Petras overall liquidity position following its move to the London Stock Exchange (LSE) main-board; and, fund other general corporate requirements (through repayment of intercompany loans) (collectively, the Project). Petra was publicly listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM), which is the LSEs international market for smaller growing companies, but moved to the LSE main-board in December 2011.Finsch was acquired by Petra from De Beers Consolidated Mines Limited (De Beers) in September 2011 after which Petra assumed full management of the mine. The acquisition of Finsch increases Petras mines to eight (Cullinan, Koffiefontein, Kimberley Underground, Finsch, Sedibeng, Star and Helam in South Africa, and Williamson in Tanzania). Petra is an existing IFC client and IFC was involved in financing Petras Williamson Diamond Limited expansion programme in Tanzania and exploration concessions in Botswana. Petra will implement a development plan at Finsch to increase production from 1.5 million carats (Mcts) per annum to 2 Mcts per annum by 2018, by gradually opening up Block 5 below the current Block 4 operations, supported by a surface tailings treatment program. Production levels from underground will be maintained during the transition from Block 4 to Block 5 by developing smaller sub-level caves within the Precursor ore body (adjacent to the main ore body) at Block 4 and within Block 5 itself. Petra foresees a long life for the operation and has a current mine plan of 18 years, though the ore body remains open-ended at depth.Finschs expansion programme entails deeper underground development within the same surface footprint and with no increase to this footprint. One of the challenges related to this expansion programme is securing sufficient water resources to supply the proposed expansion without impacting negatively on the needs of the local (predominantly farming) communities. Any impacts that may arise as part of the mine expansion project will be addressed through the EMPR amendment exercise that the mine commissioned in July 2011. Finsch is situated in the Kgatelopele Local Municipality within Siyanda District Municipality in Northern Cape Province of South Africa. The mine is located approximately 165 km northwest of Kimberley, with Lime Acres approximately 3.5 km to the northeast, Danielskuil 30 km to the north-northeast and Papkuil 31 km to the southeast. The majority of Finsch workforce lives in Lime Acres and Danielskuil; Lime Acres was built and is run for the employees of Finsch and Pretoria Portland Cement (PPC) which is situated adjacent to the mine. Danielskuil also houses employees from PPC. According to the 2001 census, Lime Acres had a population of nearly 7 000 and Danielskuil had nearly 9 000 against a total of almost 21 000 for Siyanda District Municipality. The Northern Cape has the smallest economy of the nine provinces in South Africa for which Siyanda District Municipality accounts for about 30%. The major economic activities and sources of employment in this frontier region of South Africa are mining and agriculture; tourism is the fastest growing sector. Unemployment is high and economic opportunities limited.The mine is surrounded by several farms and the PPC Lime operations. There are no perennial surface water systems located or traversing the mine property and the pre-mining land capability is classified as extensive grazing land. Soil depth limits most of the areas agricultural potential and when combined with the erratic and unpredictable rainfall, the land is considered most suited to conservation/wilderness land. Thus with the acquisition of Finsch and surrounding properties in 1962, De Beers initiated a wildlife conservation policy, which resulted in sections of properties being enclosed by a game fence and the areas being managed as game farms.Diamonds were first discovered at Finsch in 1930. Mining commenced in 1964, when a treatment and recovery plant was erected at the pipe. Initial operations were by means of open pit mining to a depth of 430m in 1992, where-after an open stoping underground method was used to a depth of 530m. The current method is by means of block-caving technology. The mine has one main shaft in which two 28-ton skips are used solely for ore hoisting, while two personnel elevators also operate in this shaft. The treatment process used at Finsch consists of three basic stages: ore preparation by crushing, washing and screening; concentration of the sized material and preparation by means of Dense Media Separation; and sorting. Old residue deposits are also reprocessed to recover residual diamonds. Diamonds extracted from Finsch are generally 60% of industrial quality and 40% of gem quality.Finschs current surface operational areas consist of a processing plant area, headgear infrastructure, workshops, administration infrastructure, waste rock dumps, two coarse residue deposit facilities (CRDs) and three fine residue deposit facilities (FRDs). There are four residential areas in the town, a clinic, shops and schools. This infrastructure is linked with Eskom power lines, tar and gravel roads, a local airstrip, and the Kimberley/Sishen railway line which passes about 1.5 km to north of the mine.","","","","The review of this Project consisted of appraising technical, environmental, health, safety and social information submitted by the company, and assessing the companys operations by a field visit conducted by the project team. Key focus was a review of management systems and organization, including review of Finsch Diamond Mines approved Environmental Management Programme Reports (EMPRs) - the South African equivalent of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for mining projects, and their associated Performance Assessments Reports; approved Social and Labour Plan (SLP); Rehabilitation and Closure Plans; and key monitoring data. The team visited the mine on the 10th of November 2011, and met key mine representatives. Field visits were organized to different parts of the mining areas as well as to ancillary infrastructure. Various discussions were also held with key representatives from Petra Diamonds Limited.","","","","","","","","","","","","Petra has good environmental and social performance (ESRR 2 on both IFC existing investments).

The existing and approved EMPR is in the process of being recompiled in line with updated legal requirements and will identify and manage any environmental aspects that may arise as part of the mine expansion project. The most significant direct social impact associated with this project is positive and involves the protection of employment for the workforce for an expected further 18 years as well as their dependents and people employed by businesses supporting the mine. Whilst difficult to quantify at this stage, there will be new job opportunities during the expansion programme although a large part of the expansion project can be outsourced from the local area. The Siyanda District Municipality and the communities in the Kgatelopele Local Municipality area will benefit from the employment, vocational training and community development potential, which will be implemented through the Finsch expansion. Petra has a strong commitment to achieve demonstrable socio-economic improvements in the communities in areas where it operates.Thus, this is a Category B project according to IFCs procedures for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because the project only involves underground expansion of an existing brownfield site, within the same footprint, by an existing IFC client with good EHSS performance and therefore has limited adverse impacts and risks which are manageable.

These pumps and injectors are used in Continental's high-precision Piezo common rail systems, which in turn are used in its diesel-based Powertrain engine systems. Continental sells the complete system, which consists of the Piezo injector, the pump, the fuel rail, and the engine control unit, to Original Equipment Manufacturers. Diesel engines consume about 30% less fuel than gasoline engines do. Further, Piezo technology produces fuel savings of up to 5% relative to other diesel engines, reduces particulate and nitrogen emissions and makes engines quieter without any loss of performance. These components fulfill EURO 6 emission standards which will apply in Europe from 2014 onwards. The Project aims at supplying injectors for passenger with diesel engines. The Project is an important step taken by the Sponsor to expand its manufacturing base in Asia in order to support the growth of its clients' fuel efficient vehicle sales in the region.","","","","","","1.	Climate change: The Project involves the manufacturing of high pressure pumps, a key component of the Piezo common rail system. Continental is a pioneer of diesel technology and is the market leader for Piezo Common Rail Technology, which will promote adherence to EURO 6 emission standards, which will be mandatory from 2014. This new technology will lower carbon dioxide emissions by over 15% relative to regional standards, and by 5% relative to world-class standards. Assuming that half of the CO2 savings are attributable to the injection system , the Industry Specialist calculates CO2 emissions reduction of 17 g/km per vehicle attributable to the use of the Piezo common rail technology. With an annual mileage of 30,000 km, a lifetime of 10 years per vehicle and a production of 145,030 vehicles in 2011, total estimated CO2 savings is 739,650 tons in 2011.2.	Technology transfer and enhancing Thailand's competitiveness: The Project will increase the competitiveness of the Thai automotive sector through the transfer of best practices and managerial and technological know-how. Innovation and high-tech manufacturing processes will support Thailand's transition to a developed country status. Historically, the development of the auto sector, including the export of high-value components, has played a significant role in the economic transformation, as exemplified by Japan, Korea and Taiwan.3.	Generation of highly skilled labor: The Project will generate approximately 780 jobs. Continental is committed to developing and strengthening its employees' technical expertise. All newly recruited engineers from Thailand attend a one year training program at its headquarters in Germany. 4.	Support of local suppliers: This Project will require local suppliers to improve their quality and will generate around EUR40 million of local purchases annually by 2014. We estimate that over 1,000 employment opportunities could also be created within the local supply chain. Continental is situated close to its supply base and provides regular inputs to improve quality through internal audits and supplier evaluation.","","","","","This is a Category B project according IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects.

Comerci has supplier finance (SF) program in place with NAFIN providing SF to 700 of its suppliers, the large majority of which are small of medium enterprises (SMEs).The Project will establish a Supplier Finance (SF) program and make financing available to the suppliers of Commercial Controladora Mexicana (Comerci or CCM or the Company), through the discounting of receivables of the suppliers payable by Comerci.  The SF program will have an IFC-funded, uncommitted credit line of US$100mn to be split in: i) US$85 million equivalent denominated in Mexican Pesos (MXN) and targeted to CCMs Mexican SME suppliers and ii) US$15 million denominated in USD and targeted to CCMs foreign suppliers based in emerging markets. The program will be implemented through PrimeRevenue, a Supply Chain Finance platform, and its local re-seller, E-Factor Network (EFN), and it is expected to reach 700 Suppliers  the large majority of which will be SMEs.","","","","IFC reviewed CCMs information publicly available including the current Company structure, Comercis 2010 corporate social responsibility (CSR) and Sustainability Report and supplemental information provided by the Companys Deputy Procurement Director, who acts as CSR and Sustainability lead for Comerci. Of CCMs business lines Tiendas Comercial Mexicana represents 75% of its revenues, and similar percentage of its suppliers, which mainly involve food companies, but also home goods, apparel and footwear manufacturers. Potential adverse E&S impacts of the GTSF project arise at the level of the Suppliers.  All Performance Standards are applicable to operations of potential suppliers to be supported by the Project.  In supplier financing programs of this nature, IFC assesses environmental and social (E&S) risk at Suppliers to Buyers (such as Comerci in this proposed transaction) by assessing the Buyers systems for management of E&S performance of their Suppliers.  Therefore the Buyer (Comerci) assessment reported in this Environmental and Social Review Summary considers the application by Comerci of PS1 Social and Environmental Assessment and Management Systems as described below.","","","","","","","","","","","","E&S risks associated with Comercis food suppliers are related to the production of raw materials, initial processing in situ, further manufacturing at industrial level, and distribution. Production of raw material, depending on the foodstuff, and the size and characteristics of the farm, commonly involves issues of labor and working conditions, pollution from fertilizers and pesticides, and management of agricultural waste. On occasion, there may also be impacts related to land acquisition and resource management (especially water). Food processing may also involve issues pertaining labor and working conditions including occupational health and safety, pollution prevention and resource management. A key issue for food production and distribution is food safety, including traceability.The most common E&S risks associated with the apparel and shoe manufacturing sector relate to labor and working conditions, whilst potential adverse environmental impacts can arise from failure of adequate treatment for process or sanitary waste effluents.The above issues are readily manageable and site specific: this is therefore considered to be an E&S Category B project.

Lacteos Toni,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Active,Latin America and the Caribbean,Ecuador,Holding Tonicorp S.A.,"Gbl Ind, Manufact, Agribus & Services",2012-02-23T05:00:00Z,2012-03-30T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"Tonicorp is one of the largest agribusiness companies in Ecuador.  Through its subsidiary Industrias Lacteas Toni SA (ILT), Toni is the leading dairy company in Ecuador.  The Group processes milk purchased from +2,400 farmers into a wide range of dairy products (UHT milk, flavored milk, cream, butter, cheese and yogurt) and produces bottled water, energy drinks and fruit beverages from concentrate under the licensed Tampico brand.  In all product categories Toni commands between 50-70% market share.  The Group also owns Plasticos Ecuatorianos SA (Plasticos), a packaging plant that supplies the dairy business and sells to 3rd parties, and Dipor SA (Dipor), which distributes all of ILTs products.With a production capacity of ~200,000 liters of milk/day, Toni operates a plant located in an industrial area of Guayaquil.  This plant, originally designed in the early 1970s to produce 7,000 MT/year of yogurt, is currently producing +30,000 MTs. Although the Group has managed to grow its capacity over time in order to keep up with increasing demand, the plant is currently cramped, having reached a point where there is no more space to grow, or changes to the layout would derived in loss of efficiencies.  Therefore, ILT is currently planning to move the plant to a new site (the Project). This will allow increasing production capacity, generating efficiencies through better layout, newer equipment and improving E&S management.","","","","","","IFC will be supporting the continued growth of one of Ecuador''s leading agribusiness companies in terms of employment and linkages through the value chain and one of the most important staple food producers in the country.  The Project will contribute to improve Toni''s competititveness in the production and commercialization of dairy products, and help the Company extend its reach toward the interior of Ecuador.  Toni has a strong base of the pyramid focus as it services more than 90,000 small shops, and sources milk from approximately 2,300 small and medium-size farmers, most of them located in rural frontier regions where employment opportunities are scarce.  Its activities therefore have a considerable reach in the local economy and impact on livelihood of local population.There are specific developmental impacts associated with the Project, which are summarized below:Product Safety: consumption of raw milk is still very popular in Ecuador, in particular in the interior of the country. This is considered a health hazard as the product does not meet minimum health and safety standards. On the contrary, Toni''s products conform with high quality and safety standards, and therefore reduce public health risks for consumers.  Toni''s growth strategy in the interior of Ecuador will displace consumption of raw milk with high quality and safe products.Employment: Toni''s improved performance and increased production capacity will result in higher employment opportunities at the plant, and in rural areas througout the country.Farmers linkages: Toni sources milk from direct and indirect farmers througout the country.  As a consequence of the Project, Toni will further develop milk production and tehrefore enhance and stabilize farmers'' income and increase hired employment on dairy farms.","","","","","This is category B project according to IFCs Policy on Social and Environmental Sustainability because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result that can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, EHS general and sector-specific guidelines or design criteria.","Founded in 1978 by Mr. Francisco Alarcon, Toni is mainly owned by the Alarcon family: Mr. Francisco Alarcon Alcivar (58.3%), Ms. Barbara Alarcon Alcivar (20.9%), Mr. Jaime Patricio Alarcon (4.7%), Ms. Maria del Carmen Alarcon (3.6%), and Ms. Maria Gloria Alarcon Alcivar (1.5%).

However, since the beginning of 2011, as part of the pre-conditionality for a US$1 billion program from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), BB has ceased to provide direct FX liquidity support to banks.  This development has resulted in an acute systemic FX, mainly US Dollar (US$), liquidity squeeze in the banking system.  The lack of FX liquidity has negatively impacted the timely issuance of L/Cs by banks, particularly for small and medium enterprise (SME) clients.  Since the bulk of the Bangladesh economy is value-added (imports, processed then re-exported), the ability to issue L/Cs on a timely basis is critical to the well-functioning of the economy.  Hence, to mitigate the adverse impact of the US$ shortage on the countrys trade flows and the SME sector, BB is now permitting select local banks with licensed offshore branches, to meet their short-term FX requirements from the international market. The proposed project is a direct response to the prevailing FX liquidity crisis and is in line with the World Banks and IFCs strategy of promoting economic growth by providing access to finance to underserved market segments and promoting international trade. The Project consists of a short-term loan and a participation in IFCs Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP) to The City Bank Ltd.s (City Bank or the Bank) offshore unit to support foreign currency trade and working capital financing for the Banks SME clients.","","","","","","The Project is expected to have the following specific development impacts:-     Financial Market Deepening: By providing local banks with much-needed FX liquidity and facilitating their access to the commercial loan market, the Facility will help deepen the financial sector by establishing a level playing field between local banks and foreign banks operating in the local market that have an advantage due to support of parent funding.  -	     Demonstration Effect: The demonstration effect of the IFC funding will encourage international banks to finance the local banking sector and increase the range and availability of funding options in the market. -  	Economic Growth Acceleration: The Facility will help accelerate economic growth in Bangladesh by providing SMEs and exporters with trade finance solutions to finance their working capital needs and pay for critical value chain imports. -	      Job Creation and Job Loss Prevention: By providing much needed working capital support to SMEs, the Facility will help create new jobs and also prevent job losses resulting from business interruption, particularly in an economy where the poor are mainly employed as daily wage workers.","","","","",This Project involves a short term loan and a trade finance guarantee from IFC to support trade and FX working capital needs of SMEs and has been classified as a Category FI project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.,"City Bank is a first generation bank in Bangladesh, i.e. it is one of the oldest private commercial banks operating in Bangladesh and was established in March 1983.

It wheels about 51% of the total power generated in India on its transmission network  comprising around 90,000 circuit-km of transmission network and 145 Extra High Voltage Alternating Current (EHVAC) & High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) sub-stations with a total transformation capacity of around 100,000 MVA. The World Bank has supported POWERGRID since its inception in 1989 during which time the company has become one of the world''s largest electricity transmission system operators. In addition to electric power transmission (including grid management, grid operation and maintenance activities), which forms its core business, the Company has also diversified into: (a) telecom, utilizing right of way on its Extra High Voltage Power Transmission Network infrastructure in the country. The telecom operation includes putting in place overhead optic fiber network using OPGW (Optical Ground Wire) on power transmission lines. POWERGRID is managing an all India Broad Band Telecom Network of about 25,000 Kms as well as intra city access networks across India; (b) electric power transmission engineering, procurement and construction consultancy services both within and outside India to governments and other utilities. POWERGRID has so far been assigned more than 300 consultancy assignments by national and international clients in construction of transmission lines, substations, load dispatch centers, distribution and rural electrification. The Company has undertaken/is executing 40 international consultancy assignments including in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Dubai, Kenya Nepal, Nigeria and Srilanka; and (c) provision of O&M services to transmission utilities in India and other countries. POWERGRID has an Rs 100,000 crores (around US$ 22 billion) capital investment plan to be implemented over the next 5 years. In the next 12 months the Companys investment plans include transmission systems for various generation projects including UMPPs, IPPs and grid-strengthening schemes across several states namely, Jharkhand, Orissa, Chhattisgarh and North-East. In order to generate resources to meet its capital expenditure program, POWERGRID is desirous of accessing international commercial financing. In this regard, POWERGRID has approached IFC to facilitate achieving its objective.IFC is considering  partly finance, with a mix of A Loan and syndicated B loan, POWERGRIDs capital investment plan for the above referred investment (the Investment).","","","","IFC is considering an A loan and a syndicated B loan to partly finance Power Grid Corporation of India Limiteds capital investment program. IFC has undertaken an environmental and social review in the context of this proposed corporate investment in POWERGRID, and this document is a summary of review findings. Review of this proposed IFC investment consisted of appraising technical, environmental and social information submitted by the Company including POWERGRIDs: investment plan; Environment and Social Policies and Procedures (ESPP); Human Resource Policies and Procedures; Sample ESA documents; standard procedures pertaining to projects, operation and maintenance; crop and tree compensation related documentation; sample internal and third party audit reports; and sample project contract documents. The appraisal team also interacted with POWERGRIDs corporate and operations professionals. The appraisal included a site visit to the Companys existing operations and projects at Bhiwadi in Rajasthan state of India.  The Team has also reviewed The Safeguards Diagnostic Review report prepared by The World Bank. The World Bank has been working with POWERGRID in development and implementation of the Companys ESPP since 1998. IFCs review has relied and drawn upon the work already done by The World Bank over the years and most recently as part of the Fifth Power System Development Project (# P115566) towards ensuring that POWERGRIDs ESPP is consistent with The World Bank Groups Safeguard Policies. The World Bank has determined, per its SDR, that this ESPP is equivalent to the Objectives and Operational Principles in relation to the requirements of World Bank Operational Policy 4.00.","","","","","","","","","","","","While POWERGRIDs individual transmission line projects typically have limited social and environmental impact (typically Category B), several of the projects to be implemented by POWERGRID have a large geographical spread, voltages above 400 kV, large substations, and it is reasonable to assume that some of the project transmission lines may pass through forest areas. Due to the broad scope of the proposed corporate investment, it cannot be completely ruled out that implementation of some of the projects by the Company may result in potentially significant adverse social and environmental impacts.

IFC is also considering providing a US$20 million loan from the Canada Climate Change Program to support eligible green building projects in addition to mobilizing up to US$35mm equivalent in local currency through syndication.","","","","","","The Project''s strong development impact includes: (i) job creation; (ii) addressing the housing deficit; (iii) integrated and sustainable urban developments; (iv) transfer of knowledge and best practices on green building in Mexico, and E&S sustainability; and (v) contribution to equitable economic growth and community development.","","","","","This is an E&S category B project because, on the basis of information reviewed by IFC, this investment will have limited adverse social and environmental impacts that are few in number, generally site specific, largely reversible and readily addressed through mitigation measuresIdentified Applicable Performance StandardsWhile all Performance Standards (PS) are applicable to this investment, IFCs environmental and social due diligence indicates that the investment will have impacts which must be managed in a manner consistent with the following Performance Standards:- PS1: Social and Environmental Assessment and Management Systems- PS2: Labor and Working Conditions.- PS3: Pollution Prevention and Abatement.- PS4: Community Health, Safety and Security.Issues related to PS5, Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement are not encountered because, as a practice, land acquisition by Urbi is done on a willing-buyer-willing-seller basis, which would not impinge on individuals or local communities rights. There are no current issues with regard to the potential displacement of occupants and/or users of land that is banked by the company (approximately 5,500 ha which is equivalent to 7 years of future housing developments). Land acquired for such future projects is regulated by state and local development plans. When an area designated for urban development is under communal ownership (ejidos), which may have been formerly used for limited agricultural production, it is legally subdivided and sold to developers under a willing seller-willing buyer arrangement. Land whose use is changed from agriculture to urban development rapidly increases in value, which amply compensates for any improvements the ejidatario might have made and is paid at the market price. Issues related to PS6, Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Natural Resource Management are not encountered in general, as by law, housing developments in Mexico cannot be located in protected areas or areas with natural habitats. In the case of the San Pedro development, small pockets of vegetation with biodiversity interest were identified through the corresponding ESIA as being in need of preservation and were appropriately incorporated in the master plan as such. Issues related to PS7, Indigenous Peoples (IPs) were not identified by IFCs due diligence because IPs are not currently affected by Urbi developments and have not been involved in prior land sales. As noted above, land acquisition by Urbi is done in practice on a willing-buyer-willing-seller basis. Issues related to PS8, Cultural Heritage may apply on a case by case basis; issues of cultural heritage have not been experienced in the San Pedro development. In order to ensure appropriate management of cultural heritage issues, however, the company will be required to prepare and implement a chance finds policy regarding cultural heritage.","Within the Mexican context, Urbi is one of the largest, most established and profitable homebuilders (despite having lowest prices in the sector), with presence in 39 cities and municipalities, including the main metropolitan areas. Urbis innovative approach has resulted in it being a pioneer in initiatives targeted to positively impact segments of the population that were not benefiting from access to government programs and consequently housing. Through this, Urbi has been ahead of the curve, having the first mover advantage by tapping new segments of the market, which has strengthened its credibility, brand as well as market positioning. During over 30 years of operations, Urbi has built more than 400,000 housing units.Some of Urbis initiatives, that support and differentiate its operations, include: (i) UrbiNet, a sophisticated information technology platform, (ii) UrbiNova, Companys proprietary construction technology, and (iii) Alternativa Urbi, a unique program in the industry to attend the non-traditional population segments (low-income workers, non-wage earners, and those not affiliated to the housing agencies). Through the City Licensee Manager (CLM) program, the company has managed to rapidly diversify into new Mexican geographies with lower working capital requirements, almost doubling its geographic coverage in three years. These tools have allowed the Company to increase its operating efficiencies and obtain profitable growth.Furthermore, Urbi was the first company to develop a Sustainable Integral Urban Development project (DUIS) in Mexico. These macro projects are comprehensively planned areas of development that contribute toward improving the quality of life of the residents and the territorial organization of the states and municipalities. The Company is in the process of developing additional DUIS projects, which would continue putting it on the front line of innovation.  In addition to the housing development business line, URBI also has a housing-related line of business, which includes commercial land sales, Urbis Casa Capital Program and housing equipment and services.Urbi has been listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange since May 2004 with a market capitalization of US$1.3bn as of 1/16/2012. 54.5% of the shares is public and traded on the exchange. ~40% of the shares belong to the Pérez Román  brothers (co-founders and members of the current management team). Companys credit rating in Mexican market is Moody A3 and Fitch A- as well as an S&P B+ in the international bond market.","An investment of up to US$50mm either in US$ or equivalent Mexican Pesos (the Project) is intended to be made in Urbi in the form of a senior secured corporate loan (the IFC A Loan). In addition, IFC would pursue a mobilization (the Mobilization or the IFC B Loan) which would result in an increase of the funding to Urbis environmentally sustainable affordable housing projects by another US$35mm equivalent in local currency.

Simandou III,Investment,Environmental Documents,Completed,Africa,Guinea,RIO TINTO SIMFER SA,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2012-03-27T04:00:00Z,"",A,Other,"The Simandou Project is a world-scale mining project comprising: (i) an open pit iron ore mine in the Simandou Range in southeastern Guinea, approximately 600 km south east from the Guinean coast,   (ii) a trans-Guinean railway of approximately 670 km in length to transport the ore from the mine to the Guinean coast; (iii) a new Port facility located south of Conakry in the Forécariah prefecture; and (iv) various associated developments providing utilities and infrastructure to the project including construction workforce facilities, roads, quarries, power generation and distribution and water supply. First ore is anticipated in 2015, with the production expected to increase over the following years to an estimated 95 million tonnes per annum.The mining resource is located in the southern part of the Simandou Range and covers deposits at Pic de Fon and Ouéléba.  The main geological units are known technically as hematite and goethite (iron ore), itabirite and phyllite.  These minerals extend up to 500 m below the surface and the two orebodies are estimated to contain more than two billion tonnes of high grade iron ore.  The Simandou Project is being developed by Simfer, a Guinean-registered company.  Simfer is a subsidiary of the international mining group Rio Tinto, and holds a mining concession to explore and mine iron ore in the southern part of the Simandou Range.  Simfer is owned 5% by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and 95% by a company owned jointly by the Rio Tinto Group (53%) and a consortium led by Aluminium Corporation of China, Chalco, (47%).  In April 2011, the Republic of Guinea and Simfer signed a Settlement Agreement pursuant to which a modified mining concession covering the southern part of the Simandou range was issued to Simfer.  The Settlement Agreement also provides inter alia, for the separation of the mining activities from the principal infrastructure activities (the railway and port).  The mine will continue to be held by Simfer whereas the rail and port infrastructure will be held by an infrastructure company to be established between the Republic of Guinea and Simfers other shareholders (Rio Tinto, Chalco and the IFC).The total project financial commitments for Simandou III activities currently forecast at approximately $4.0 billion.  This amount includes the $700 million settlement sum (as agreed in the agreement signed between Simfer and the GoG, announced by Rio Tinto plc on 22 April 2011), technical studies and resource definition drilling through to the completion of the PEA and DE, as well as long lead item orders and early construction works.  The long lead item orders and early construction works will be necessary during this period in order to achieve the targeted first production in 2015.IFC received board approval on May 24, 2012 to invest an additional $150 million to contribute towards achieving the Decision to Mine milestone at the end of 2012.  In 2006 IFC obtained board approval to invest $5 million in equity to Simfer (Simandou I project) and a further $30 million in 2007 (Simandou II project), of which $32 million in total has been disbursed.","","","","IFC owns a 5% equity interest in Simfer SA (Simfer), a Guinean-registered company and holder of an iron ore mining concession (the Simandou Project) in the Simandou mountains of South-East Guinea. Simfer SA is 95% owned via Simfer Jersey Limited which is jointly owned by the Rio Tinto Group (53%) and a consortium led by Aluminium Corporation of China, Chalco,(47%).  Simfer has undertaken extensive iron ore exploration work in Guinea since 1996 and IFCs long relationship with the Simandou Project has developed since 2005.  IFC has visited Guinea and the Simandou Project area numerous times with a team of environmental & social and technical staff between August 2005 and May 2012.Since exploration started in 1996, Simfer has conducted several environmental and social studies.  Since IFCs first investment in the Simandou Project (Simandou I), it has monitored the implementation of its Action Plan (AP) through the review of Annual Monitoring Reports, monthly conference calls and site visits.The current phase of the project (the Simandou III) encompasses the completion of a Preliminary Engineering Assessment (PEA), Definitive Engineering (DE), early construction works and advance ordering of long lead items with total financial commitments, including the US$700 million payment as part of the Settlement Agreement with the Government of Guinea (April 2011), estimated at approximately US$4.0 billion up until end of 2012.  IFCs most recent Environmental and Social (E&S) due diligence for the Simandou III investment took place in September 2011 when a visit to the project area was conducted with the objective of site familiarisation and gauging the level of community support for the project. The visit included a reconnaissance flyover of the Simandou ridge, the furthest east 50 km of the railway, potential biodiversity offset areas and the location of a potential hydropower dam (Lolema). There was also an inspection of the facilities at the workers camp, Canga East which serves as the hub for all exploration activities associated with the mine component of the project. Meetings were held with local authorities and representatives from the local communities of Beyla, Moribadou, Nionsomoridou Waterferedou II, Lamandou and Kerouane. The World Bank Group Board of Directors approved the Simandou III project on May 24, 2012. Since the due diligence visit, IFC personnel have visited the proposed Port area and flown the entire length of the rail corridor, and the mine site as part of the supervision of the project. Additionally, IFC have attended numerous meetings with Simfer and their consultants to provide guidance in the development of the Social and Environmental Impact Assessments (SEIAs), the resettlement and compensation approach, review the technical, environmental and social documentation and generally discuss the status of the project. The project finalized the Social and Environmental Baseline studies (SEBs) for the mine in 2009 and the railway and port in 2012.  Four early works SEIAs were approved by the Government of Guinea in the PEA phase (late 2011 and early 2012). During the Definitive Engineering (DE) Phase the project completed the SEIAs for the main components (Volume I, Mine;Volume II, Rail; and Volume III, Port), undertook an extensive consultation programme and submitted them to the Government of Guinea for approval. A separate volume (Volume V) containing  the Social and Environmental Management Plans for all of the SEIA components was also submitted to the GoG.  Several construction phase Environmental and Social Management Plans are under development.The PARC Framework agreement has been completed and agreed with the IFC and the project has been declared a Project of National Importance (PIN) by the State (4th October 2012). The Framework is currently under Government review and is pending approval. Once approved by the GoG, IFC will disclose the Framework. Detailed Resettlement and Compensation Plans (PARCs) will be required for the rail, port and mine components and the project has committed to the preparation of these prior to any resettlement activities taking place.Simfer continues to work to ensure that a successful resettlement programme will be delivered according to IFC principles, standards and PARC Framework.  Through the identification and implementation of project avoidance criteria, engineering designs are adjusted to minimise potential resettlement and socio-economic impacts.Since its appraisal of the three investments in Simandou (Simandou I, II and III), IFCs input on E&S issues has included the following: (i) review and provision of comments on the Terms of Reference (ToR) for the different components of the project SEBs and SEIA, (ii) review and provide comments on several other key documents including: Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan (PCDP), PARC Framework, local climatological studies, biodiversity critical habitat assessment, health impact baseline studies, grievance mechanisms etc.; (iii) contribute to the development of the biodiversity strategy for the Pic de Fon and Oueleba areas; (iv) assess opportunities for social and economic development (v) review and endorse four early works SEIAs (Camps, Marine Offloading Facility, Roads and Quarries),(vi) reach agreement on the early works Environmental and Social Action plan (ESAP) and (vii) review and endorse the SEIAs for the main project.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",31067,"","B-BA - Iron (Pellets, etc.)","","","",""

The Company, which continues to grow through organic expansion and acquisitions, was successfully listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange in June 2011. In the same year, the Company acquired Mpongwe Farm in northwestern Zambia. Zambeef has also been listed on the Lusaka Stock Exchange since February 2003. The Company continues to roll out its West Africa expansion in Nigeria and Ghana, as well as developing its palm oil project in Mpika, Zambia.The IFC investment (the Project) is to assist Zambeef with its three year developmental capital expenditure plan, including: 1) upgrading and expanding the Zamanita edible oils plant; 2) post acquisition expansion and upgrading of Mpongwe farm, including conversion of at least 500ha of rain-fed to irrigated to increase soya & wheat production; 3) expansion of processing capacity at Masterpork, dairy plant and poultry; and, 4) a new ruminants plant at Novatek feed mill in Lusaka. Zambeefs operations include: Farming Division  Huntley, Sinazongwe, Chiawa and Mpongwe, and Palm oil plantation in Mpika; Meat and Dairy  beef feedlots and abattoirs, chicken broilers and abattoirs, chicken layers, Kalundu dairy farm, and piggery and pig abattoir; Manufacturing/Processing Division  Zamanita edible oils plant, Novatek stock-feed plant, leather and shoe plant, flour mill and bakery, and meat and dairy processing plants;Retail Division  Zambeef outlets, Shoprite butcheries, Zamchick Inns, wholesale depots, and transport and distribution.

The main environmental, occupational health and safety, and social (EHSS) issues identified during that initial appraisal included: (i) weak internal controls to assess and manage environmental impacts and comply with national environmental, occupational health and safety (OHS) and food safety standards; (ii) food safety issues from weak implementation of Good Manufacturing Processes and microbiological contamination; (iii) hazardous materials transportation, storage, and use; and, (iv)  resettlement and relocation issues. To mitigate these issues, Zambeef, with technical and financial assistance from Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH, Cologne, Germany (DEG), embarked on the development and implementation of a comprehensive Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) based on IFCs Performance Standards requirement and World Bank Group (WBG) Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines. In addition to this ESAP, a supplemental ESAP was produced after IFCs due diligence process and agreed upon with the Company.The environmental and social due diligence of this follow-on investment project focused mainly on evaluating progress made by Zambeef in implementing its ESAPs under DEG and IFCs loan agreements. The scope of the due diligence for this repeat investment also comprised review of available corporate and project-level environmental and social documents, including ESAP implementation progress reports produced by independent consultants.","","","","","","","","","","","","The project has been categorized as a Category B according to IFCs Environmental and Social Sustainability Policy because the Project is a follow-on investment for an existing IFC client who is fully committed to successfully complete the implementation of its ESAP requirements for the initial investment, thereby achieving compliance with national legal and regulatory requirements as well as with the IFCs Performance Standards. IFC is satisfied that Zambeef continues to make good progress in implementing the agreed upon ESAP. Specifically, since the first investment, Zambeef has established a fully functional Environmental, Food Safety and Technical Services department. This department is responsible for the implementation of the ESAP. There is a high level corporate commitment and resourcing which is clearly demonstrated by the fact that more than 75% of the ESAPs Action Items from the combined DEG and IFC ESAP items have been successfully completed.

Azito Phase 3,Investment,Environmental Documents,Active,Africa,Cote D'Ivoire,AZITO ENERGIE SA,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2012-03-30T04:00:00Z,"",B,Other,"The Project is an expansion (Azito Phase III) of the Azito Power Plant by converting the plant to combined cycle operation. This conversion essentially involves addition of two heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) and a 139 MW steam turbine, to the existing 2 x 144 MW simple cycle natural gas-fired turbines. The Project is expected to generate about 50 percent more power without using additional gas (gas turbines exhaust heat generates steam in a boiler to power a steam turbine) and with zero incremental emissions. This switch from simple-cycle power generation to combined cycle will increase energy efficiency of the Azito Power Plant from approximately 29.5 percent to approximately 44 percent (Gross HHV).Azito Power Plant, as planned in the initial project design in 1998, consists of building, owning, operating and eventually transferring to the State, a gas-fired power station with a total capacity of approximately 420 MW, to be implemented in three phases. In the first phase 144 MW simple cycle gas turbine operation was commissioned in January 1999 and in the second phase the second 144 MW simple cycle gas turbine  was commissioned in February 2000. Expansion of capacity through conversion to combined cycle, which was originally planned in the third phase (in 2002) has been delayed but is being undertaken now. The existing gas turbines are designed to operate with natural gas (mainly) and distillate oil (back-up only). However, since initial commissioning of the Plant in 1999, the turbines have  exclusively operated on gas. The distillate oil storage tanks (2 x 6000 m3) and related facilities will continue to be maintained for back up operation. Gas for the Plant comes from three sources in CÔte d Ivoire: the Devon fields (Lion/Panthèere), the Foxtrot field; and the CNR fields (Espoir/Baobab), with Foxtrot field as the primary gas supplier.Azito Power Plant is located on a 5 ha plot of land near the Azito village in Yopougon District, approximately six  kilometers West of the port of Abidjan in CÔte d Ivoire . The Plant premises are located alongside the Western arm of the Ebrié lagoon and the finished ground level (±0.00 level) in the Plant is +4.5 m above mean sea level. Béago, a second village is located about 300 m North East from the Plant boundary. The Plant premises are bordered (along the Northern fence) by a gas treatment unit, independently operated by Foxtrot, which provides condensate-free feed gas to Azito Power Plant, and by an electrical switchyard operated by the Compagnie Ivoirienne dElecticité (CIE  national electricity distribution company) on its Western fence. The existing transmission line (T-Line) is adequate to evacuate power from the expanded capacity.The Project involves construction of: steam turbine installation and building; HRSG installation; air-cooled condenser installation; control and electrical building; water treatment building/de-mineralization plant; administrative building; and warehouse. The duration of the construction works will be approximately 27 months. The Project does not require any land acquisition, since the facilities will be built over land which is already part of the Azito Power Plant concession. The temporary lay down areas and workers accommodation camps during the construction phase may occupy land outside of the site limit but these will also be within the existing 300 m exclusion zone around the existing power plant. The Project site can be accessed by an existing road. Much of the construction material, and construction and project equipment will be transported on this access route but there is a possibility that construction and project equipment may be transported by barges from Abidjan port.","","","","The review of this Project builds upon the supervision, undertaken since the year 2000, of IFCs previous investment (IFC project # 8503) in Azito Power Plant (the Plant). Azito Energie S.A, (Azito or the Company) is owner of the Plant and also the Project proponent. Up until early 2011 Azito reported to IFC regarding the ongoing management of environmental and social performance at the Plant, which had been satisfactory. IFCs recent review in February 2012 consisted of appraising technical, environmental and social information submitted by the Company including: Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for the Phase III expansion Project of the existing Azito Power Station in Abidjan, CÔte dIvoire dated March 5th, 2012 prepared by Environment Resources Management, including the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP);Azito Phase 3 Expansion Project Environment and Social Impact Assessment: Scoping Study dated November 2010 prepared by Environment Resources Management;Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) Power Plant Project in Abidjan, CÔte dIvoire dated April 1998 prepared by Environment Resources Management;Noise Abatement Plan for the Azito Power Plant Project in Abidjan, CÔte dIvoire dated December 1998 prepared by Environment Resources Management; andEnvironmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of Azito - Abobo Transmission Line and Substation (Addendum to the EIA of CCGT Power Plant Project) dated April 1998 prepared by Environment Resources Management;The review also included a discussion with: the technical and management professionals from Azito Energie and Azito Operation and Maintenance S.A. (Azito O&M, the power plant operator); Agence Nationale de lEnvironnement (National Environmental Agency or ANDE); Cabinet dEtudes, Conseils dAssistance et de Formation (CECAF - the in country consulting firm involved in the ESIA process); and Environment Resource Management (ERM) team involved in the ESIA process. Further, the review included a visit to the Project site and the Attiéké factory at Azito village, all in Yopougon District of Abidjan city in the Republic of CÔte dIvoire.","","","","","","","","","","","","The Project involves capacity expansion through conversion of an existing simple cycle power plant to combined cycle through installation of above mentioned facilities within the existing power plant premises. The Project impacts will be time limited (short term during construction) and site limited (within immediate plant area) and it is not expected to result in any new significant long term impacts.  Accordingly, this is a Category B project because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

During appraisal IFC assessed in detail the Bank''s existing capacity to review, identify and manage the E&S risk of such sub-projects, including examples of E&S due diligence. As a subscriber to the Equator Principles, BBVA Continental has procedures in place to review its project finance activities against the IFCs Performance Standards and the Peruvian national laws. For each sub-project financed as part of the IFC loan, the Bank will conduct an E&S due diligence to identify the applicable E&S risks and require corrective actions as needed to ensure that these risks are managed according to the Performance Standards and applicable laws. As part of supervision of this project, IFC will review the implementation and performance of this procedure for the first few projects and all Category A projects, if any, prior to investment. IFC also reviewed BBVA Continental''s labor practices and concluded that the Banks labor policies are aligned with Performance Standard 2: Labor and Working Conditions. The client will be required to: maintain its Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) and conduct E&S due diligences of all renewable energy sub-projects, to the satisfaction of IFC, to ensure that activities associated with the project are in compliance with the E&S requirements; Identify responsible, qualified staff  to manage and implement the ESMS; maintain its commitment to applying the labor standards established by PS2; and submit a periodic report to IFC in a format to be provided by IFC.","","","","",31459,"",AB - Commercial Banking - Housing Finance,"","","",""

These include areas such as manufacturing and niche industrial segments, which have traditionally received a very small portion of private equity capital in comparison to their total contribution to the Indian economy.  BanyanTrees core proposition centers around its ability to find companies that are growing and capital constrained but reluctant to dilute to the extent a traditional private equity financing would require. BanyanTree has positioned itself as a provider/arranger of hybrid capital based on the teams long experience of structured finance.

Proceeds of the loan will be used to finance the expansion of the Companys lending activities to micro and small entrepreneurs (the Project). Ameen s.a.l seeks long-term funding to continue its growth and continue offering existing and new products to its target clientele. Ameen s.a.l is one of the leading microfinance organizations operating in all regions in Lebanon and serves more than 14,400 clients, of which 27% are women. Ameen s.a.l mainly operates through branches of three partner banks that fund and book their share of originated loans on their books. By end December 2012, Ameen s.a.l served its clients through 73 branches of partner banks and offers a range of products to its clients with an average loan size of about US$1,190.","","","","","","(i) Funding: IFC will provide medium/long term funding, that is not available in the market, to enable the Company to continue supporting and further grow its client base. The loan would also assist the Company to diversify their funding and better manage their asset and liability position at the time of limited funding opportunities. (ii) Access to finance: The proposed Project would support AMEEN Lebanon, one of the main microfinance providers, expand its outreach and serve a larger number of low-income people in Lebanon.(iii) Job creation: MSMEs are key contributors to job creation in the Country. Developing a vibrant MSME sector, with reliable access to finance, can play a significant role in private sector led economic growth, generating employment and providing opportunities to the poor and under-served groups. (iv) Demonstration effect: Through this project, IFC is expected to act as a catalyst by encouraging other investors, especially local banks, to fund the microfinance sector and bridge the financing gap facing this sector. Furthermore, the fact that IFC''s first microfinance investment project within Lebanon is with one of the only two microfinance players in the market that adopt best practices and are regulated by the Central Bank, would amplify the value and credibility derived from adopting best practices and falling under the supervision of the Central Bank, hence encourage other players to apply best practices and convert to NBFIs, thereby developing the microfinance market.","","","IFC''s additionality will come from providing medium/long term funding, which is not available in the market especially to microfinance institutions that would support the Company in growing its portfolio and extending its reach during its current expansion phase. The long term nature of the loan represents a stable source of funding and accordingly would facilitate better liquidity management and enhanced ability to reach out to the targeted underserved segments. An Advisory Services package has been provided to the Company, which has addressed critical functions including MIS and internal audit, and assisted in developing the Company''s HR Department. Other Advisory Services are yet to be extended, which would address RM, product development and marketing, setting up a compliance department, and inturn would reflect positively on the Company''s efficiency and competitiveness in the market.","","","Ameen s.a.l was founded in 2003 as a joint stock service company to continue a USAID-funded microfinance program (Access to Microfinance and Enhanced Enterprise Niches) initiated by CHF International in October 1998.  The Company transformed into commercial for profit company regulated by the Central Bank in October 2007, thereby becoming a licensed financial institution amongst the Lebanese microfinance providers and the first MFI supervised by the Lebanese Central Bank.Since establishment, Ameen s.a.l was part of CHF International network of 9 subsidiaries in the Middle East, Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Southern & Eastern Europe.

In addition, collocation reduces the incremental cost of expanding service for all carriers thereby allowing them to service remote and economically less developed areas where average revenues per user and minutes of use tend to be lower. (ii) Increased competition: The entry of Eaton Uganda will add a second player in the tower sharing market which will lower barriers to entry for smaller and newer mobile phone operators through access to leased towed facilities compared to building their own.  (iii) Expand access to other ICT technologies: Eaton Uganda will be building a tower network capable of not only supporting mobile network traffic but also wireless broadband, backhaul and broadcast networks, which would increase the penetration levels of these technologies. (iv) Contribute to mitigating environmental impact and Climate Change: The Company''s constructed network and services offered will provide a cost effective opportunity for operators to lower their carbon emission as well as physical footprint by sharing infrastructure.  Significant benefits of tower sharing arise from the material, energy and emissions savings incurred from building only one tower compared to each operator building their own site to cover the same terrain.","","","(i) Knowledge Sharing: IFC has developed good relationships with major telecom operators in Sub-Saharan Africa and will make its experience available to the Company.  (ii) Establish and Maintain Good Social and Environmental Standards, Anti-Corruption and Anti-Money-laundering practices: IFC will work with Eaton Uganda to ensure that it develops and implements related policies and procedures that address these critical issues as the Company expands its operations in Uganda.  (iii) Enhanced Opportunity to Provide Long-Term Funding: Given that the acquisition and expansion of shared telecommunication infrastructure is capital intensive, IFC''s ability to mobilize long term capital for operations of the Company in Uganda is essential.

Having reached a critical mass and achieved a solid financial position, KQ finds itself well positioned to capitalize on the growth prospects and opportunities that the African region and the international market presents. KQs strategic intent is to establish its brand and its presence in the most important intra African markets as well as become a significant player in long haul origin-destination city pairs that are expected to grow over the next few years. To implement the Project, the Company has already placed firm orders to aircraft manufacturers in connection with the acquisition of nine Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft and ten Embraer 190 aircraft.

From a social and labor point of view, the Company estimates that the number of employees will nearly double after five years (currently 4,400 employees) most of which are of a technical/qualified labor nature.  At the regional level of Sub Saharan Africa (""SSA""), the launch of the freighter division coupled with the opening of new intra-Africa destinations will contribute to markets integration and will reduce the transactional costs of trade, an aspect that is extremely important to promote the economic development of the SSA economies.

This type of financing is currently not readily available in the market from financial institutions that are reluctant to increase their exposures to the airline sector, except for export credit agency backed financing for the purchase of aircraft.  ii) Demonstration effect: KQ is undertaking a significant expansion that requires the support of many investors.

Gulftainer has now decided to expand its container, cargo and logistics operations at Umm Qasr. It plans to develop and operate a 750,000 m2 bonded dry port north of Umm Qasr port (Umm Qasr Logistics Center or UQLC), which is expected to serve not only the container traffic at the port, but also the transport and logistics needs of the oil and gas industry in Southern Iraq (the Project). Gulftainers objective is to establish a first class logistics and oil field supply facility in the Basra region based on two main activities:A fully fledged dry port (inland container depot) targeting general traffic; andAdditional services targeting specifically oil and gas companies looking for integrated and secured facilities to operate in Southern Iraq including (i) rental offices and accommodation, (ii) field support rental of equipment and transport, and (iii) long- and short-term rental of serviced but undeveloped plots for hazardous, fabrication, commercial, and oil and gas industry clients.The Project is expected to have a significant contribution towards the redevelopment of the logistics and transport infrastructure in Iraq which is essential for the economic development of the country as well as its integration into the global economy.","","","","","","Once regarded as having one of the Middle East''s most comprehensive transportation systems, Iraq''s transport and logistics infrastructure has suffered from more than two decades of neglect and underinvestment. Rehabilitation of such infrastructure is a major national and regional trade issue. Gulftainer investments in Umm Qasr Port should help solve this issue and thus contribute to Iraq integration in the regional and global economy.Iraq relies heavily on imports for its consumer goods and for its reconstruction program. Cost effective transport of imported goods is therefore critical to Iraq''s economy. The 2012 Doing Business indicators however show that Iraq''s is lagging behind other countries in the region in terms of logistics performance. Gulftainer''s investments to modernize one of Umm Qasr berth combined with its experience to efficiently manage container terminals is expected to improve the situation.At present, a substantial portion of goods coming into Iraq are off-loaded at ports in the neighboring countries such as Kuwait, Turkey and Jordan and are then transported into the country by road, which tends to increase the time and cost of delivering the goods to the end consumer. The Project should have a significant impact on reducing these impediments to trade in Iraq and foster the country''s reconstruction efforts along with its economic growth and development. Efficient and well-developed transport and logistics infrastructure is an essential component for the expected growth in Iraq''s oil and gas production and export-related activities and the Project would play a strong role in facilitating these improvements.In addition to its direct impact on trade, the Project should also contribute towards socio-economic development through the creation of several hundred jobs, reduction in the cost of goods paid by the end consumer (through reduction of costs incurred in the transportation process) as well as substantial royalty payments to the Government of Iraq.Through its involvement at Umm Qasr port, Gulftainer will also play a strong role in training and improving the skills of the employees of the Iraq Port Authority, help introduce industry best-practice and contribute its valuable know-how in managing ports and logistics operations, which should improve the overall efficiency of the sector.","","","IFC is in a position to offer a facility which tenor (10 years) is needed by Gulftainer to develop its Iraqi ventures in a phased and sound manner, and which cannot be matched by commercial banks (usually 5 years) especially in the current market situation<br><br>Although the investment is structured as a corporate loan at UAE level, IFC is willing to take some Project and Iraqi risk, which other institutions cannot do.<br><br>IFC will also improve the environmental and social standards of Gulftainer''s activities, as a result of the introduction of IFC''s Performance Standards.<br><br>IFC''s presence at such early stage of Gulftainer''s international development should help the group i) structure its emerging market activities in a way that could facilitate its future fundraising and ii) mobilize international sources of financing a later stages.","","","An existing client of IFC since September 2010, Gulftainer Company Limited, based in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and founded in 1976, is a well established company whose core business consists of the operation and management of two container terminals in the Emirate of Sharjah: the Sharjah Container Terminal (SCT) operating since 1976 at Port Khalid in Sharjah city, and the Khorfakkan Container Terminal (KCT) since 1986 on the eastern side of the Straits of Hormuz.

The volume of coal, cement and clinker handled by Pakistan ports grew by more than 15% between 2007-08 and 2008-09. These volumes are currently handled primarily by small privately managed facilities at various Pakistan ports, none of which is equipped with adequate equipment or storage capacity.  To respond to Pakistans need for a dedicated bulk terminal, the Port Qasim Authority (PQA) in 2008 launched an international competitive bidding process for private sector operators to develop and operate such a facility in Port Qasim, located approximately 50 km southeast of Karachi.  In August 2009, Pakistan International Container Terminal Ltd. (PICT) won the bid. PICT has created a fully-owned special purpose subsidiary, Pakistan International Bulk Terminal Limited (PIBT or the Project Company) to develop and operate the project.  PICT currently operates a container terminal in the Port of Karachi under a 21-year agreement signed in 2002 with the Karachi Port Trust.

Since then, the Company has continued to grow both organically and through acquisitions and currently contracts and or partners with farmers on approximately 140 000 hectares on which they farm about 650 000 tons of grains and oilseeds (approximately 7% of South Africas grain production), raise 100 000 heads of cattle and farm 3 200 hectares of fruit across the nine provinces of South Africa. The Company is currently considered to be an innovative participator and service provider in the areas of, agri-inputs, primary agriculture and agri-outputs through its contracting of and partnerships with large-scale farmers in South Africa.Farmsecure operations can be mainly broken down as follows: Farmsecure Fruit and Fruit Growers; Farmsecure Grains and Livestock; Farmsecure Technologies (Farmsecure Carbon, Pro Gas Solutions, Kynoch Fertilizer, etc); and Farmsecure Global Markets. Farmsecure has recently entered the fruit sector in own production and packaging. It manages about 15 million cartons of fruits a year (of which own production accounts for 6 million cartons). Under the grain contract-farming model, Farmsecure provides pre-harvest working capital through a Contract Farming agreement with selected farmers. Through this Contract Farming agreement, Farmsecure establishes conditions for scientific implementation of the production, working capital, insurance, including weather risk cover, and marketing of the grains to be produced. The Company agrees with the farmer, among other parameters, on farming practices (including scientific farming) to be applied to ensure maximization of the yields (under the supervision of Farmsecure Agri Science). Under the livestock contract-farming model, the Company provides selected farmers with working capital towards purchasing young animals to raise/fatten-up for sale to a slaughter house. As with crops, Farmsecure agrees with the farmers on best veterinary practice to be applied to ensure maximization of the weight of the animal at slaughter (under the supervision of Farmsecures animal scientists).In 2011, Farmsecure introduced Farmsecure Optimized Farming (FOF) an enhanced variant of the original grain contract-farming model. FOF, which is the Companys preferred model going forward, currently covers 55 farmers compared to 352 farmers in the contract farming model. In this model, Farmsecure signs a long term farming and lease contract with the farmer (as opposed to the annual contract under contract farming). Farmsecure takes over the farming operations and the farmer is employed to farm on behalf of Farmsecure. Thus, Farmsecure is more hands-on in terms of monitoring farming operations and as a result has a better control over the application of best farming practice.Farmsecure Carbon, which is 100% owned by Farmsecure Technologies  a subsidiary of Farmsecure, is a project development and consultancy Company for greenhouse gas emission mitigation and renewable energy in the agricultural sector and on farm level. Farmsecure Carbon currently has a portfolio of more than 20 waste-to-energy projects, which include processing of by-products into fertilizer, in various stages of development.. Kynoch Fertilizer is a leading importer, blender and retailer of a complete range of granular, liquid and specialty fertilizers in Southern Africa. Kynoch is the exclusive distributor of Yara Internationals premium products in Southern Africa and sells around 400 000 and 100 000 tons of fertilizer annually in South Africa in the rest of Southern Africa respectively. Pro Gas is an inputs supplier of Nitrogen in the form of direct ammonia application in South Africa and in the Southern Africa region. Pro Gas is estimated to sell 4 000 tons of liquid ammonia annually.The IFC investment (the Project) consists of an up to 500 million South African Rands ($64mn) funded risk participation in Standard Chartered Bank South Africa (SCB or the Bank) financing facility to Farmsecure.

The IFC financing will further support the Bank to provide financing to trade-oriented SMEs in Vietnam for their exports, imports and working-capital needs.","","","","","The main E&S risks and impacts of the project derive from the E&S risks of the Banks lending activities, the capacity and systems in place to manage these risks, and the Banks practices with regard to labor and working conditions.

Increased access to finance is indispensable to grow the competitiveness of SMEs.

This is especially important in an environment where a large number of SMEs have been severely affected by the continuing financial crisis. Financial support to SMEs is thus critical to employment preservation in adverse market conditions.  Hence, the Facility will have a direct impact on job preservation and employment generation through Techcombank''s financing provided to private companies.","","","(i) Market Stability: Similar to other local banks, Techcombank has seen increasing need for short-term USD funding as international banks have been cutting down on their exposure to Vietnam. The State Bank of Vietnam (""SBV"") has been enforcing administrative measures in an attempt to enhance the availability of USD for export oriented businesses. Therefore, IFC''s intervention will be to contribute to and support the Government''s effort in bringing stability to foreign currency borrowing by enterprises for foreign trade-related purposes.<br>(ii) Mobilization Effect: In addition to the strong signaling effect of this Facility, IFC potentially can play a mobilizing role by bringing other financial institutions to participate in the financing.","","","Techcombank, is the second largest private joint stock bank (JSB) by assets as of December 2011, operating through a network of 307 branches and transactional offices.

VMLA has recently launched operations in Chile.  IFC will be providing up to US$11 million C loan to fund Virgin Mobile Chile SpA (VMC or the Company).  VMC will be offering mobile phone services targeting the youth segment with a targeted offering that will expand mobile broadband usage with attractive data packages.","","","","","","The Project is expected to have the following development impacts: i. Greater availability, affordability & accessibility of mobile services: Mobile Virtual Network Operators (""MVNOs"") contribute towards expanding reach, lowering the cost and increasing competition in mobile telephony. Besides voice services, VMLA''s product offering will support further expansion of mobile broadband, particularly in niche markets that have not been successfully served by traditional Mobile Network Operators (""MNOs""). Particularly, VMLA will target the youth market which has more limited purchasing power than other population segments.  In this regards, VMLA is positioning itself as the first pan-LAC MVNO, targeting the youth sector with highly segmented and tailored voice and data offerings.ii. Efficiency gains in the telecom industry through the sharing of infrastructure: The concept behind MVNOs is the sharing of telecoms infrastructure with existing mobile network operations (i.e, VMC will use Movistar''s network to provide its services). The specialization enables the use of existing spare capacity for niche markets through the sharing of infrastructure, ultimately contributing to generate greater efficiencies of the telecom industry overall.iii. Greater availability of broadband services (mobile in this case) and innovation: Greater access to mobile broadband is expected to contribute towards improving productivity and generate economic efficiencies. The contributions of broadband connectivity to economic growth, and as a kick-starter of other innovative business models (e-health, e-education, e-commerce, etc.), are widely accepted.","","","i. Long term financing: IFC support of Chile''s VMLA greenfield operation in the form of long term is critical, as the company is embarking on rolling out multiple operations across the region in an international context of high financial volatility. Success in Chile, its first launch, is important in terms of eventually rolling out in other countries.  <br><br>ii. Stamp of Approval:  MVNOs are common in Europe and US, but the concept is still largely untested in LAC. As such, new entrants face difficulties in raising non-recourse financing for greenfield operations.  Furthermore, traditional financiers do not fully understand the MVNO business model. IFC involvement in the project will assist in validating the business model for other investors, allowing future mobilization of resources to this industry segment. <br><br>iii.

In addition, IFC will provide sector expertise and regional knowledge.","","","VMLA is a privately-owned company. The Virgin Group, one of the worlds leading MVNO brands,  provides VMLA and its subsidiaries with the use of the Virgin Mobile brand name, as well as close support from current and former Virgin Mobile senior executives in business strategy, product design, marketing, sales distribution, customer support, technology, wholesale agreement negotiations and public relations.

In order to take advantage of the growth of the packaging industry in Turkey, Kipas is currently planning to invest in a EUR260 million recycled fiber based greenfield corrugated paper and cardboard facility with a capacity of 450,000 to 480,000 tons per annum depending on the product mix (Project).  Kipas Kagit (Company), a Kipas subsidiary, will undertake the project.  The Project will use 100% wastepaper as raw material.  The Project will use recovered paper (RCP), old corrugated containers (OCC) and mixed waste paper, as raw material.  The Project includes installation and operation of (i) Paper Machine (PM) - 1,536 ton/day gross, efficiency 85%, 350 days/year - corresponding to annual production capacity of 450,000 to 480,000 ton per year,   (ii) Recycled Fiber (RCF) Plant - 1,500 bone dry tons/d - corresponding to Paper Machine production of 450,000 to 480,000 tons per year, and (iii) 50 MW (gross) coal-fired Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) boiler Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant.The CHP plant will be a captive plant providing heat and power to the paper mill operation with high energy efficiency.  The net electricity output of the CHP plant will be around 45 MW, of which about 33 MW of electricity will be provided to the Project, and 7.5 MW of electricity for the forthcoming expansion of the Paper Machine expected to be developed within a few years with additional 150,000 ton per year production capacity, resulting in the total electricity demand of 40.5 MW.  The remaining generation capacity represents contingency over these initial estimates, to allow for production peaks and future capacity expansion from paper machine development.  The CHP plant will also supply about 132 MW heat for the Project and the forthcoming expansion of the Paper Machine.  The CHP plant will be fueled by a mixture of local coal procured from Turkish coal market and imported Russian coal.  Being the combined heat and power operation, the overall energy efficiency of the CHP plant is estimated to be around 70%, much higher than the electricity only CFB boiler power plant.  The ash and the flue gas treatment by-products will be 100% utilized by Kipass cement factory.  The CFB boiler will have limestone injection plus flue gas desulfurization system to control sulfur dioxide emissions.  The Project will be located in a small town of Kilili in the Turkoglu County of Kahramanmaras Province.  The nearest village of Kilili is about 500 m from the site.  The area of 328,000 m2 has been reserved for the Project and future forthcoming expansion.

Since the establishment of the first hog farm in 1992, the business has seen progressive expansion.  IFC previously made an equity investment in Muyuan in 2010. Currently Muyuan operates 17 farms, including two boar station, breeder farms (great grandparent, grandparent and parent farms) and hog farms. The farms occupy a total area of 427.55 ha, with individual farm sizes ranging from 0.43 ha to 109.5 ha. In addition, Muyuan operates one feed mill in Guanzhang Town with an annual production capacity of 400,000 tons.  Eight facilities are currently under construction; two feed mills and six farms (including those at Wolong and Dengzhou). Muyuan previously partnered with Shandong Longda Group Limited (Longda) to establish a slaughter house with a processing capacity of 1 million hogs per year (i.e., 3,000 hogs/day). The slaughter house is a dedicated facility designed to process mainly Muyuan pigs with Muyuan owning a 40% stake. Individual farms are located away from local communities in rural areas in the agricultural Neixiang County. The majority of the land area of each farm is occupied by housing for the pigs.  Pigs are provided with on-demand feed and water, the former deriving from silos located outside each unit.  Pigs are provided with slatted floors allowing for the collection and storage of solid waste and urine below the unit with subsequent flushing or gravity flow to biogas digestors. Summer cooling is provided through ceiling or wall fans and opening of shutters: buildings are designed to maximize air flow through the unit.  Winter heating is provided by water heated by small coal-fired boilers and pumped through a ground level piping system. Farms also have offices, accommodation and a canteen.IFCs proposed loan investment of $20M can be considered a corporate loan but it is understood that the proceeds will primarily support the development of the Wolong commercial hog farm facility to allow for annual production of 300,000 hogs. Upon completion, this Project would expand Muyuans annual hog production capacity to 1.35 million.","","","","The IFC Environmental and Social (E&S) Review of Muyuan included a review of E&S policies, procedures and practices managed by the Muyuan Foodstuff Co, Ltd (Muyuan or the Guarantor) and a field visit to the pig farm of Wolong Muyuan Breeding Co., Ltd (Wolong or the Borrower), which is being built to allow for the rearing of 300,000 pigs (the Project).

The appraisal included a review of the progress of E&S commitments made by Muyuan in conjunction with a previous IFC investment. Biosecurity practices restricted close-up access to farms and employees.

(Aqualia or the Sponsor), a leading company in the global water management business, has been engaged in public-private water projects in developing countries since 2005. Aqualia currently has five projects under construction and operation in Algeria, Egypt and Mexico, including the: (i) Mostaganem (capacity: 200,000 m3 per day) and Cap Djinet (capacity: 100,000 m3 per day) desalination projects in Algeria; (ii) New Cairo (capacity: 250,000 m3 per day) wastewater treatment project in Egypt; and (iii) Queretaro (capacity: 129,600 m3 per day) and El Realito (capacity: 86,400 m3 per day) aqueduct projects in Mexico. Subject to IFCs proposed equity investment mentioned below, Aqualia intends to form a new investment holding company (Aqualia Capital or the Company) which will be responsible for the development, financing, ownership and operation of water projects in developing countries, except in Eastern Europe where it is already pursuing similar opportunities through an existing investment company, Aqualia New Europe B.V. Aqualia plans to transfer its ownership interests in the abovementioned five projects into Aqualia Capital after obtaining relevant approvals for such transfers. The Sponsor is currently considering bidding for water projects in Latin America, North Africa and South Asia.","","","","","","The Sponsor has been actively participating in and expanding its business presence in developing countries. In the context of rapidly growing demand for reliable water and wastewater treatment services in developing countries, public sector financing constraints and generally lack of quality service delivery by the public sector, private sector participation can play an important role in serving the growing demand, financing the required infrastructure expansion and rehabilitation works, and improving sector efficiency and quality of service delivery. Aqualia has significant operational experience, technological know-how and managerial competencies that it can leverage and share to contribute to the development of the water sector in its developing country target markets.  Water scarcity has become a matter of serious global concern and it has become especially pronounced in the Middle East and North Africa region, where the Sponsor is currently active. In Mexico, the Sponsor is building aqueducts to deliver water to communities which are facing growing water scarcity as nearby aquifers have been over-exploited. The Sponsor''s desalination projects in Algeria and aqueducts in Mexico are expected to serve around 2.8 million people.  The Company is expected to develop new projects in the future that will help significantly expand the number of customers to whom it will deliver clean drinking water. Rapid urbanization and industrialization in developing countries has also meant that governments need to aggressively address the issue of wastewater treatment in a sustainable manner. Projects like the Sponsor''s New Cairo wastewater treatment plant will be important in proper management of wastewater and the re-use of treated wastewater for purposes such as irrigation. By contributing to enabling increased access to clean drinking water, improving efficiency in water management and supporting best practices in wastewater management, the proposed Project will support sustainable economic development.","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

Coop Bank has its roots in the cooperative movement having been established in 1965 by agricultural cooperative marketing societies.  Over the last 15 years, the Bank has transformed into a strong universal bank catering to all market segments including public sector, corporate, SMEs, micro-entrepreneurs and the Cooperative sector.","","","","","The key risk is the ability of Coop Bank to identify and manage the environmental and social risks associated with its lending activities particularly to the agribusiness sector, and farmer co-operatives. Additional E&S risks and impacts of the Project derive from the capacity and systems in place to manage these risks, and the Banks practices with regard to labor and working conditions.

Long term funding to address the existing maturity mismatches will offer a lower risk funding approach to the Bank''s business and consequently allow for increased reach in terms of broader access to finance for various market segments.  In summary, the provision of long term finance is expected to have strong development impact in the following areas:i) Access to Finance - SME: IFC''s long-term funding will allow Coop Bank to grow its SME lending business and enable it offer affordable long term finance to its clients;ii) Access to Finance - Agriculture: access to long term funding will enhance the Bank''s ability to grow its agribusiness lending portfolio and increase the tenor of its loans;  andiii) Access to Finance - Trade: the trade line under GTFP will allow the Bank to ramp up its trade activities and more importantly offer affordable trade finance to SMEs.","","","Through its proposed partnership with Coop Bank, IFC will play a unique role in:<br><br>i) providing long-term US$ financing, currently in limited supply in the market, to help the Bank address maturity mismatch and grow its long term lending business in a sustainable way; and<br>iii) providing additional institutional endorsement to support the Bank''s regional expansion and future capital-raising efforts.","","","Coop Banks largest shareholder is Coop Holdings Cooperative Society Limited, which holds a 65% stake in the Bank on behalf of over 3,800 cooperative societies and unions who were shareholders of the Bank prior to its listing on the NSE.

The Project is expected to finance in excess of US$1.5 billion of energy commodity trade flows to Mauritania over two years by providing much needed liquidity.  This will protect an IDA economy against the risk of energy shortages, the risk of being cut off from suppliers as commercial banks have reduced their emerging market exposure.(b)  Ensuring availability of energy products in the local economy, critical for consumption, power and other energy needs.  A steady supply of critically needed fuel through regular channels will keep prices in check, remove parallel market incentives, and improve affordability particularly for the vulnerable poor and is necessary to sustain economic activities.  (c)	SME Development -  By supporting the private sector companies in the country''s downstream oil sector, the project will provide business opportunities to local private companies involved in transportation, distribution, and retail of refined oil products","","","(a) With the help of IFC, Mauritania can access commercial and official sources of funding to finance the import of refined energy products  essential for the working of its economy, covering the country''s entire energy needs over the next two years.  Due to the continuous constraints on banks traditionally active in the trade finance space, including European banks, and the increased cost of US funding, the proposed facility will allow continued importation of energy products into Mauritania.   Without this facility, all sectors and economic agents, such as power generation, transportation, agriculture, industrial and commercial entities and households will be negatively impacted, hurting economic activity.  There is also a risk that the current successful tendering and private sector involvement would stop, forcing the State to get again involved in the trade of fuel products, use scarce foreign exchange reserves for energy rather than food imports, and potentially resorting  to barter trade if state financing were not available.   This will be a setback to Mauritania''s reform program of private sector development and devolving the importation and marketing of energy to private companies.  <br><br>(b)  IFC''s presence enables the mobilization of financial resources  from other development financial institutions and also commercial lenders.  In the current market environment, Mauritanian risk is hard to finance, notwithstanding the security structure from pledged oil and confirmed L/Cs from international banks, and currently importers have difficulty accessing discounting facility of commercial banks, an arrangement needed to finance their trading operations.","","","BB Energy (Gulf) DMCC, domiciled in the United Arab Emirates, is part of the BB Energy Group of companies  (the Group).

This quarry located 21 km from the plant and at 4880m altitude, will be operated by Calidra.   The plant will install a 400 tpd Maerz kiln to produce between 350-420 tons of quicklime per day.  Initially, the plant will use anthracite and pet coke; however it expects to begin using natural gas once the Peruvian government installs a proposed nearby gas pipeline by 2014. The anthracite will be transported by ship from the northern part of the country to the Matarani port where it will be temporarily stored. The anthracite and the pet coke will be transported by railroad respectively from the port and the Matarani Petroperu storage areas to the Chasquipampa station and from there by truck to the plant.  The electricity needed will be obtained from the power grid. Water needs will be supplied by the nearby Pulpera River, located 30 m from the project site.  In addition to the plant installation, the Company will also build needed internal access roads, a 1.7 km transmission line, and a 2.5 MW electrical substation.Calidra assessed three different sites prior its final site selection for the Calquipa plot based on environmental, technical, and socio economical aspects as indicated in the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) developed for the project.ColombiaCalidra anticipates building two greenfield plants in Colombia.  The first plant is expected to be built near the town of Victoria in the department of Caldas (between Bogota and Medellin).

The project area is rainforest degraded by slash-and-burn subsistence agriculture, bush-meat hunting, selective logging, artisanal gold mining and recent gold exploration activities. There are several small villages in the area, many associated with active artisanal mining.The Dugbe F/Tuzon project has identified an inferred/indicated mineral resource and is currently continuing early exploration work. Dugbe exploration camp has been established on the west bank of the Jubo River and is the main centre of field operations. It houses about 80 staff and includes workshops for vehicle maintenance, woodwork, etc., a basic clinic, communications equipment and the core shed. Exploration drilling around this area has identified gold deposits hosted in Birimian rocks typical of this region of West Africa.A number of other smaller licenses are owned by Hummingbird, such as Kana Hills, Ba, Zia, Jubabli, Nemo Creek and Tiehnpo, with exploration work limited to stream sediment sampling, soil sampling and preparation for trenching and future drilling. IFC investment will finance continuing early exploration work at Dugbe to be undertaken prior to pre-feasibility study of potential future mine development.","","","","IFCs review of the project consisted of an appraisal visit to Hummingbird Resources PLC (Hummingbird or the Company) prospects in Dugbe in southern Liberia. The appraisal reviewed environmental, health, safety, and social information submitted by the Company and identified their plans and commitments for the future development of the prospect. The IFC team held discussions with Hummingbirds management and technical staff, reviewed environmental health and safety documents, visited the drill sites, and conducted a meeting with the local community members in the village of Tuzon.

The Dugbe exploration license (450 km²) was first granted in November 2005 to Hummingbird and was renewed in October 2009. The Dugbe exploration license would normally have expired on 24 October 2011.  As required by the license an application for a Mineral Development Agreement (MDA) was submitted prior to the expected expiry of the Dugbe exploration license, and on 14 September 2011 the Minister for Lands Mines and Energy of the Republic of Liberia wrote to Hummingbird to confirm that whilst the exact timings of the MDA application process were unforeseeable, all licenses controlled by Hummingbird are in good standing regardless of when their due date occurs.  Negotiations with the Government of the Republic of Liberia in relation to this MDA application are ongoing.Dugbe has a total mineral resource of 3.8 Moz (96 Mt grading 1.24 g/t ) including 1.4 Moz indicated and 2.4 Moz inferred.

The Project owner and developer is a Mongolian company, Oyu Tolgoi LLC (the Company) indirectly owned 66% by Ivanhoe Mines Ltd  (Ivanhoe),  a Canadian public company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and 34% by Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC, a Mongolian State owned company. The deposit, which was acquired by Ivanhoe from BHP Billiton in 2000, consists of a near surface (Southern Oyu) copper/gold orebody together with a high grade deposit (Hugo North) suitable for underground mining discovered in 2002. With resources of almost 80 billion pounds of copper and 45 million ounces of gold, Oyu Tolgoi is one of the worlds largest known copper/gold deposits. The Project is being developed in phases starting with construction of a copper concentrator and associated infrastructure to support production of 100,000 tonnes per day of ore, to be sourced predominantly from the Southern Oyu open pit mine development. In parallel underground infrastructure and mine development is ongoing for the Hugo North deposit. Commercial operations from the initial open pit mining development are expected to start in mid-2013. Underground production from Hugo North is expected to commence in 2016. A potential expansion of concentrator capacity (subject to required regulatory approvals and the identification and permitting of additional water resources) to 160,000 tonnes per day of ore, is currently being studied.  Mine output, in the form of copper concentrate, will be trucked along a dedicated new road to the China border, to reach the Companys primary target market of Chinese copper smelters.  Power for the initial years of operations will be sourced from China, to be replaced by an on-site captive coal fired plant, which is currently in the advanced planning phase, with initial earth site work expected to start in Spring 2013.","","","","","Mining currently accounts for 70% of exports and more than 30% of Mongolian government revenues and will continue to be the mainstay of economic growth for Mongolia as the Project and other large scale mining projects come on stream in coming years.

IFCs investment will come in parallel to a proposed equity investment by the IFC African, Latin American and Caribbean Fund (ALAC or the ALAC Fund), managed by the IFC Asset Management Company (AMC). Among other development outcomes, the investment will contribute to the eventual reduction of the greenhouse gas footprint of the Dominican Republics energy generation matrix, which currently relies on liquid fuels, especially on Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO).Projects currently under consideration by IEH include: (i) a flagship LNG terminal and gas pipeline network in the DR: (ii) an expansion of the companys existing portfolio of renewable energy projects in the DR, including solar and wind power; (iii) an expansion of its generation park focused on gas-fired capacity; (iv) a transmission line interconnecting the DR with Haitis power grid; and (v) acquisition of certain power assets in the region to diversify the Companys geographic exposure. All of these potential projects/assets are at the conceptual stage of development and are not amenable for a full E&S due diligence at this point in time.","","","","An equity investment in IEH (the Project), exposes the IFC to three different types of assets: (a) existing controlled assets, namely CEPM and CESPM, (b) future assets or projects to be directly developed by IEH, and (c) existing and future assets under EGE Haina, where IEH has a non-controlling interest as well as limited operational exposure and control. The first two sets of assets are also referred to as IEH Controlled Group throughout this document.IFC reviewed documents for both IEH Controlled Groups  and EGE Hainas environmental, social, and health and safety management (ESHS) policies, practices and supporting procedures, including documents developed by IEHs predecessor, Basic Energy Ltd (Bahamas) (BEL). IFC also interviewed the IEH Controlled Groups and EGE Hainas management and their corresponding ESHS teams. To further understand how the companies currently manage ESHS performance, IFC visited the two facilities under IEH control, namely CEPM and CESPM power generation complexes. In addition, the IFC also visited La Sultana power plant (owned and operated by EGE Haina). Since there are no IEH controlled assets currently under construction, the IFC also performed a site visit to the construction site of Quisqueya I and II, two greenfield 215 MW HFO currently under construction and to be commissioned in 4Q2013.  Quisqueya I is being built by Barrick Gold Corporation to supply energy to the Pueblo Viejo Gold mine, and will be operated by EGE Haina. Quisqueya II, is being built and will be owned and operated by EGE Haina.  (Neither Quisqueya I or II will be part of the CAPEX to be financed by the IFC.)

IFCs investment will come in parallel to a proposed equity investment on similar terms by the IFC African, Latin American and Caribbean Fund (ALAC or the ALAC Fund), managed by the IFC Asset Management Company (AMC). Together, these equity contributions will support the Companys expansion of its existing businesses and new possible power and energy sector investments. It will focus on renewable energy development and natural gas diversification, while not excluding other selective opportunities in the electricity sector in the Caribbean and Latin America, such as Haiti. Pipeline projects include (i) a flagship LNG terminal and gas pipelines network in the DR: (ii) an expansion of the companys existing portfolio of renewable energy projects in the DR, including solar and wind power; (iii) an expansion of its generation park focused on gas-fired capacity; (iv) a transmission line interconnecting the DR with Haitis power grid; and (v) acquisition of certain power assets in the region to diversify the Companys geographic exposure.","","","","","","Development impact from the proposed IFC/ALAC equity investment is manifold. The Company is among the few domestic/regionally based IPP companies in the Caribbean region and considers ""high developmental impact"" synonymous with ""long-term commercial success"" as its core strategy. IEH through BEL invested in the sector when others were exiting, and has successfully turned around then-problematic companies (e.g. EGE Haina and CESPM) or started out distribution utilities in remote places where there was no electricity supply to support tourism development (e.g. CEPM and CEB) Thus, the Company''s  success is hoped to help catalyze more generation investments and companies following a similar long-term developmental perspective in the DR and the region. The projects within the pipeline, if successful, could alter the energy map of the DR region with a profoundly positive economic impact - a significant reduction in electricity generation costs and an alleviation of balance of payment problems.","","","IFC has closely collaborated in the past with BEL.  BEL relied on IFC for long term loans for financing one of its operating subsidiaries, CEPM- an 8.25 MW wind power project in 2005 and a transmission project in 2007. IEH will leverage on IFC''s sector and country-specific knowledge and will work together with the IFC in determining potential projects to invest in.   IFC''s equity participation in the Company would be a natural evolution of this close working relationship between IFC and a private sector company, whose focus is to achieve higher commercial returns through investments facilitating economic development in frontier regions/countries.  In this context, the proposed IFC investment would contribute to: (i) supporting a DR-based, second-tier sponsor to grow regionally (i.e. south-to-south transactions), (ii) promoting power sector investment in countries with challenging sector environments, (iii) enabling IEH to mitigate the risk of its investment through IFC''s international sector experience and World Bank relationships.","","","The project sponsor is IEH, owned 88.33% by an investment vehicle (the InterEnergy Fund) managed by InterEnergy Partners  Ltd.

(Organica or the Company) is a Budapest, Hungary based wastewater treatment (WWT) technology company that is developing and deploying a next-generation, biological wastewater treatment technology. The Organica technology utilizes proprietary algorithms to create engineered ecosystems that efficiently treat and recycle the same quality wastewater in significantly less space, using less energy and generating less sludge than conventional treatment plants, and done in an aesthetically appealing way that integrates seamlessly into urban environments.   The Organica WWT technology was originally conceived in 1998 and the Company has since completed 28+ installations operating worldwide, including in Hungary, France, China, and Poland.  The technology is designed to enhance the natural processes of complex ecosystems by creating considerably more diverse biology than those already in use in the industry.  Since 2008, Organica has signed over 20 contracts for its technology deployment, including 11 projects in France, 5 projects in China, and its first 80,000 m3/day retrofit plant in Hungary using its second generation technology.  The Company is currently seeking to expand its commercialization efforts in emerging markets such as India, China, Indonesia, Turkey and Eastern Europe, focusing on municipal and industrial WWT opportunities in the 1,000-100,000 m3/day hydraulic capacity.","","","","","","1.	Improving Water Sanitation and Wastewater Reuse in Emerging Markets:  Organica''s wastewater treatment (WWT) technology offers a highly cost competitive, space saving, and decentralized solution to customers.  This technology application is particularly attractive in the chosen emerging markets that Organica operates in, where a) urbanization and water quality issues are prevalent; b) WWT infrastructures are relatively new and stakeholders are relatively more open to adopting new WWT solutions; and c) increasing urban population density requires WWT solutions that minimizes footprint whilst aesthetically pleasing/ecosystem-like solutions allow for preservation of land value in the vicinity. 2.	Promoting a Decentralized and Distributed Wastewater Solution:  In addition to driving resource efficiency on every level- lower energy usage, lower geographic footprint and lower infrastructure costs; Organica''s WWT solution is comprised of botanical garden like structures which blend into the urban landscape with no resemblance to traditional facilities. The sustainable look and feel as well as the smaller infrastructure footprint promote a decentralized and distributed approach towards WWT and contribute to a drive towards urban sustainability in emerging markets.3.	Improving Effectiveness of Wastewater Treatment Solutions: Organica''s utilization of plant roots andits patented artificial media as a special biofilm carrier creates a more diverse and complex biological treatment system that improves treatment efficiency by maximizing oxygen transfer. This ultimately enhances the resilience of the WWT infrastructure against variations in treatment volume and wastewater quality variability. 4.	Stimulating Water Technologies Innovation and Resource Efficiency:  Organica''s innovative biological treatment solution generates substantial savings in capital cost, operating cost, energy use and physical land use compared to conventional WWT technologies.  IFC''s investment will stimulate technological innovation in WWT solutions that addresses energy and resource efficiencies, thereby strengthening its target market''s ability to delivery key infrastructure services and offer decentralized solutions.","<table>

NRPPL intends to set up a wind power project of 75 MW in Chilarwadi village of Man Tehsil, Satara District of Maharashtra, India (the Project) through a subsidiary NSL Wind Power Company (Satara) Private Limited (NSL Wind or the Company). The Project will be implemented in two phases with 25.5 MW to be implemented in the first phase. Construction period for each phase is expected to be [6] months from start of construction. IFC is considering providing a loan to NSL Wind to part finance the Project.The Project involves supply, erection, testing, commissioning, operation and maintenance of 50 wind turbines, with a unit generating capacity of 1.5MW to be supplied by ReGen under a supply, erection and commissioning contract with NSL Wind. Further, ReGen is also the O&M operator of this Project under an O&M contract with the Company. Transformers will be located near the turbine within an access controlled area. Underground cables will connect each turbine-transformer and overhead conductor will connect the transformer to the pooling substation. ReGen has constructed a 220 kV Transmission Line from Pooling Substation to the Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited  (MSETCL), the state transmission utilitys interconnection point. The pooling sub-station, 220 kV T-Line and monitoring station will be shared with 125 MW capacity ReGens other existing and future projects for other project owners.The Project area falls in three villages viz. Chilarwadi, Puklewadi and Virli of Man & Khatav tehsil in Satara District of Maharashtra State of India. The wind farm will be located on a table top plateau and will require a total area of 62 ha. However, at each turbine location only about 1 ha land is required. Typically, each turbine is located in the center of a 50-80 m diameter land plot, which includes also the transformer and switchyard for the turbine. However, 2.5 acres of land is usually purchased for each turbine location. The additional land over and above the 80 m diameter is used as lay down area during construction and is required for use by cranes during both turbine installation and maintenance work. The balance 12 ha land is for access roads and internal roads between turbines. 62 ha of land is comprised of 33.4 ha private land purchased on a willing seller-buyer basis and 28.6 ha government revenue land to be transferred/leased to the Company. The Company has availed the services of a land agency to purchase the private land. 33 of the 50 turbines will be located on private land and the balance on government revenue land. There is an operating 42 MW project about 1 km from the Project site and a further 100 MW of existing wind power project located at about 5 km or more from the Project site. Additionally, 31.5 MW of projects are proposed of which 16.5 MW is within 1 to 5 km of the Project site. There has been no diversion of government land or sale of private land from Virali village to any other project. Further, 5 and 3 turbines from other proposed projects are planned in Chilarwadi and Puklewadi villages requiring about 6 and 3.5 ha of land respectively.","","","","The review of this project also draws upon the supervision of IFCs previous investment (# 29912) in NSL Renewable Power Private Limited (NRPPL). NRPPL reports to IFC regarding the ongoing management of its environmental and social performance and their progress has been satisfactory.IFCs review consisted of appraising technical, environmental and social information made available by NRPPL including the: Social and Environment Impact Assessment Study (ESIA) dated August 2012 for the 75 MW wind power project being set up near Chilarwadi village by NSL Wind Power Company (Satara) Private Limited; Rapid Biological Assessment of Chilarwadi Wind Farm Site, July 2012;  sample supply, erection & commissioning and Operation and maintenance agreements (O&M) with ReGen Powertech Private Limited (ReGen or the O&M operator); NRPPLs Human Resource (HR) policies; and NRPPLs social, environmental, health and safety (SEHS) management system procedures (SEHSMS) as applicable to the Project. The appraisal team also interviewed NRPPLs corporate and project management as well as environment, occupational health, safety and human resources professionals. The appraisal also included visits by IFC staff to NRPPLs other operating wind farm at Bheemasamudra in Karnataka and the proposed Project site at Chilarwadi, district Satara, Maharashtra state of India.","","","","","","","","","","","","The proposed IFC loan to the Project is a Category B project because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result, which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

IFC will be providing a financial package of up to US$14 million to fund Virgin Mobile Colombia (VMCO or the Company).  VMCO will be offering mobile phone services primarily to the youth segment, with a targeted offering that will expand mobile broadband usage with attractive data packages.","","","","","","1) Innovation/Demonstration Effect: MVNOs are relatively new in LAC. Through this innovative business model the whole mobile ecosystem benefits (i.e., MVNOs, MNOs, technology providers, and most importantly, the consumer). The MVNO model allows for a deeper penetration of services (i.e., including mobile broadband, etc.) as poorly attended client niches (i.e. youth in the case of Virgin) obtain a well targeted service offering more aligned to its needs and expectations.2) Broadband / Productivity enhancement: VMLA offers a data centric service offering. Broadband directly contributes towards improving productivity. The contributions of broadband connectivity to economic growth, and as a kick-starter of other innovative business models (e-health, e-education, e-commerce, etc.), is widely accepted. 3) Infrastructure Sharing: Infrastructure sharing (i.e., including towers) is a key theme in IFC''s TMT sector strategy. The concept behind MVNOs is the sharing of existing telecoms infrastructure, thus maximizing efficency, increasing competition and reducing prices. The owner of the core infrastructure (i.e., MNOs) also benefits as it revenues increases by selling additional minutes and data wholesale. Moreover, the fact of leveraging on existing infrastructure makes this investment a ""climate friendly"" project. MVNOs have no substantial infrastructure or facilities, so they are unlikely to create E&S risk. 4) Availability, Affordability & inclusion of underserved markets: MVNO contributes to expending the reach of underserved population segments, lowering the cost and increasing competition in mobile telephony.5) Youth: VMLA directly targets the youth segment. Youth in general have a lower purchasing power than other population segments, and thus, a targeted and relevant service offer contributes directly to attending this segment''s needs.","","","1) Long term financing across the region: MVNOs entrants face difficulties in raising non-recourse financing for Greenfield operations. Traditional financiers do not fully understand the MVNO business model. IFC support is critical, as fundraising is particularly challenging in the current context of global financial volatility.<br>2) Stamp of Approval: Sponsor sees significant value in IFC''s involvement, as a way of further validating the business model after IFC''s involvement in its first regional launch (Chile). IFC participation will provide comfort to other investors.<br>3) Support an existing client to expand across LAC: VMLA has already launched in Chile and plans to deploy its MVNO business in 7 additional countries, including Colombia and Brazil.<br>4) Mobilization: Funding of Colombia operations might imply attracting co-investors. IFC capability of mobilizing financial institutions will help to achieve financial plan completion.","","","VMLA follows a branded venture capital model, with independent private investors funding a venture supported by a well-known consumer brand.

It is currently estimated that the current penetration of microinsurance is close to 2% of the potential market worldwide and that up to 4 billion people at the ''bottom of the pyramid'' could potentially benefit from microinsurance to mitigate their vulnerabilty against risks and disasters. Insurance can prevent people from lossing the achievements of their whole life and from falling back into abhorent poverty.The Project is expected to increase the availability of micro-insurance products to low-income people in Sub Saharan Africa and Emerging Asia, markets that have very low insurance penetration rates. Based on conservative projections, MicroEnsure (ME) expects an increase of more than 7 million low-income people accessing micro-insurance in the next 5 years, however there is a potential for this outreach to be much higher. ME is actively engaged in the provision and development of weather index insurance, a new and innovative product, currently in several countries and reaching tens of thousands of low-income farmers. As ME continues to develop the technology and management of this product, it has the potential to be rolled out on a mass scale.IFC expects the project to have a strong demonstration effect in the micro-insurance space by establishing the viability and profitability of a micro-insurance platform that can successfully deliver tailored products and utilize innovative distribution channels to reach the low income segment.","","","In addition to IFC''s financial support in the form of equity, IFC brings broad experience in and knowledge of the insurance sector, unique experience in the relatively underdeveloped micro-insurance sub sector and a vast network of risk carriers, MFIs, telecommunications companies, and other potential partners for ME. IFC''s involvement will provide a ""stamp of approval"", but also credibility to a concerted push into the microinsurance space. IFC''s best practises in corporate governance, E&S, AML/CFT and responsible finance are seen a tools to mitigate the risks inherent in a fledgling market such as micro-insurance.<br><br>Specifically, IFC''s additionality in supporting ME operations is given by (i) strengthening ME''s capital base,  allowing ME to expand its operations, and therefore the offering of micro-insurance products, (ii) facilitating ME''s entrance into new markets through IFC''s client network and relationships, and (iii) advising ME on the implementation of corporate governance best practices.","","","Currently ME is 100% owned by Opportunity International (OI).

In 2006 the Government of Nigeria privatized the Eleme Petrochemicals Company located in Port Harcourt, the capital city of Rivers State.  At the time IFC provided an investment to Indorama to acquire a 75% equity stake in the Company which was renamed Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals Limited (Eleme or the Company). The current shareholding is:  the Indorama Group 65%, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) 10%, Rivers State Government 10%, Host Communities 7.5%, the Nigerian Federal Government 5%, and Employees 2.5%.IFC is no longer invested in Indorama and is currently considering a $300 million loan to Eleme to support development of a new urea-based fertilizer plant.  The current operations are located on a 360 hectare site west of central Port Harcourt.  Approximately 50% of the site is developed and thus there is sufficient space to accommodate the new plant. Existing operations on the site include an Olefins Plant that produces 330,000 tons of ethylene and 126,000 tons of propylene annually.  The primary feedstock for the Olefins plant is Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) which is supplied by the Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC), a joint venture between Agip and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, via an 84 kilometer pipeline from a gas collection and separation plant (gas plant)  located in OBIAFU /OBRIKOM.  The ethylene is used in the Polyethylene Plant to produce high and low density polyethylene with a total combined capacity of 320,000 tons per year. Propylene is used in the Polypropylene Plant to manufacture 120,000 tons of polypropylene polymers per year; these are used in the various applications including the production of materials associated with packaging and labeling, textiles and plastics amongst others. The facility also has two nitrogen plants that produces 4,400 Nm3 of nitrogen gas and 10 metric tons (MT) of liquid nitrogen per day. Power for the facility is generated via two out of four available natural gas turbines with a total power generation capacity of 132 megawatts (MW) and there are 3 steam turbines for the Olefins Plant. The new fertilizer plant will be located within the confines of the existing site and occupy some 38 hectares.  The main project components involve an Ammonia Plant, a Urea Plant and Urea Granulation plant. The Ammonia Plant will produce 2,300 tons of ammonia per day that will be transferred to the Urea Plant, though in the event that the Urea Plant is not operational, the ammonia would be fed to a storage tank.  The Urea Plant will produce 4,000 tons of granulated urea which will either be exported via the port or sold in the domestic market.  With the exception of natural gas that will be transported to the site via a new pipeline to be constructed, all the utilities required for the operations such as power, air  and nitrogen will be supplied via existing on-site facilities.The new gas pipeline for the fertilizer plant will be constructed by Eleme within an existing 15 m Right of Way (RoW) in which there are currently two existing gas pipelines; both of these traverse the RoW between Eleme and the gas plant at OBIAFU /OBRIKOM. The new gas pipeline will be operated by NAOC to ensure synergy in overall operations of all the three pipelines (the new gas pipeline and two existing pipelines within the same RoW). In addition, a new Port Terminal (jetty) will be built at Onne Port on a plot of land some 6 ha in extent and owned by the Nigerian Port Authority (NPA). The land has been leased to Oil Industrial Service Limited (OIS) for a period of 25 years commencing November 2005, and the lease is renewable for a further 25 years.

Berthing Section-1 will measure 180 m and be suitable for accommodating urea vessels with a length overall (LOA) of up to 180 meters to serve Eleme.  Berthing Section-2 will measure 105 meters and serve OIS; this will be suitable for vessels with a LOA of up to 105 meters and accommodate break bulk, pipes and containerized cargoes. In addition to the quay, there will be terminal infrastructure including all material handling facilities necessary for urea and a urea storage facility with a capacity of 45,000 MT.  Other facilities as required for operation of the jetty will include a site office, generators, a control room, parking areas, a weighbridge and fire fighting facilities.  The transfer of urea from the fertilizer plant will be by road via an existing road network.Construction of the new fertilizer plant will commence in early 2013 with commissioning in late 2015.  The start dates for construction of the jetty and gas pipeline are still to be confirmed, however given the need to be operational once the fertilizer plant is commissioned, construction of the jetty and gas pipeline are expected to commence in 2013.","","","","IFCs view of this project included:A site visit inclusive of the existing operations, the site for the new fertilizer plant and the location of the new jetty; Meetings with Elemes Financial Director, the Project Head who is also responsible for Environment, Health and Safety, Quality Control and Assurance Manager, Safety Manager, Fire Safety Manager, Human Resources Manager, Training Manager, Security Manager and Medical Doctor.

Once the first phase of the Vinnytsia new poultry facilities comes online in 2013, MHPs working capital requirements are expected to increase to be financed through internal cash generation and IFC debt.This would be IFCs fourth investment in the MHP. In 2003, IFC initially invested in MHP to support its efforts in chilled poultry distribution and sunflower feed technology (Project ID 21071). IFC followed-up with an equity investment and a loan in 2005 (Project ID 24011) for further expansion of existing facilities and construction of new ones in Mironivskys complex of integrated operations. Information about these projects was disclosed on the IFCs website and locally. In 2010, IFC invested in MHP to support its efforts in expanding the scope of its agricultural operations. E&S performance for this last investment is satisfactory and ESAPs action items have been effectively implemented. Information on the E&S aspects of the current Project (Project ID 29204) can be found at the IFC website through the following link:http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/spiwebsite1.nsf/ProjectDisplay/ESRS29204.","","","","MHP Mironivsky Hliboproduct (MHP or the Company), one of the leading Ukrainian agricultural and consumer companies, is an existing IFC client. Available information about the Companys E&S performance derived from the previous IFC investments was analyzed and taken into account during this appraisal. As such, the scope of this review was mainly focused on operations related to further expansion of crop production areas and new poultry production facilities being constructed.IFCs environmental and social (E&S) review of this project consisted of a field visit to the Vinnytsia facilities located close to the town of Ladyzhin, Vinnytsky region, Central Ukraine; meetings and discussions with MHP corporate and local management (operational, environment, occupational health and safety, social) and review of key environmental, occupational health and safety and social documentation provided by the Company. The field visit included observation of hatchery facilities, rearing sites, a slaughter house and a meat processing plant, construction sites of a sunflower crushing plant and a fodder plant, and silos operating since 2011.","","","","","","","","","","","","IFCs environmental and social review reveals that this investment will have impacts that must be managed in a manner consistent with the IFC Performance Standards (PS) on Social and Environmental Sustainability listed above. Impacts related to PS5: Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement, PS6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources, PS7: Indigenous People and PS8: Cultural Heritage are not expected with this investment for the following reasons. Any future land acquisition will only be done through willing seller / willing buyer negotiations. Project operations will not have direct adverse impacts on biodiversity as crop production is located on consolidated agricultural areas; the local population is not known to include indigenous people communities; the likelihood of finding of unknown cultural heritage, particularly archeological resources, within the existing agricultural and industrial zones is low. This proposed investment is expected to have limited and site-specific environmental and social impacts and none is expected to be significant. Those impacts can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to recognized performance standards, procedures, guidelines and design criteria as described in the following sections. Thus, this is a Category B project in accordance with IFCs Environmental and Social Sustainability Policy. This categorization is in accordance with other similar type of projects within the sector. The project is designed to avoid, minimize and manage environmental and social risks and impacts of the Companys operations in compliance with applicable IFCs Performance Standards and World Bank Group (WBG) General and sector-specific (Crop production; Poultry production and Poultry Processing; Mammalian Livestock Production; Vegetable Oil Processing; Meat Processing) Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines.","","","","",32632,"",A-BB - Poultry Farming,"","","",""

The Company is in the process of setting up two manufacturing plants, Butterfly Industries Limited (BIL) and Butterfly Manufacturing Company Limited (BMCL) in an effort to manufacture its products locally, thereby giving it better competitiveness. The Project Company is BML, which is setting up the two manufacturing plants.

The company will be creating 200 new dealerships across the country in the next three years to expand its distribution network, which will create additional indirect jobs; (ii) Technology transfer: BML will be leveraging the technical expertise of LG and Hisense to set up its manufacturing plants, adopting manufacturing best practices, which is expected to improve the overall quality of BML and, in due course, of other companies in the industry; (iii) Diversify Bangladesh''s export basket: BML plans to export Hisense (and possibly other branded) products once operations have stabilized. This would help Bangladesh diversify its export basket and improve the country''s over dependence on the textile sector; (iv) Increase domestic consumption: By selling branded household appliances at lower prices, BML will make these aspirational goods affordable to a much larger section of the country''s population, promoting domestic consumption; and (v) Reduce trade deficit: BML''s backward integration will help reduce Bangladesh''s total import bill and will lead to foreign currency savings, which will help shore up the country''s foreign exchange reserves.","","","(i) Industry: IFC''s industry expertise in retail and manufacturing have yielded a set of recommendations, which have already been incorporated into the Company''s future plans.

Turkey InstitutionsIn Turkey, Plato has 3 facilities in Istanbul, and another 8 facilities outside Istanbul in state premises as described below.  Among the Istanbul facilities the largest and main campus is known as the Balat Campus, which is composed of 9 buildings of 4500m2 closed spaces and 1000m2 of open spaces that are scattered around in an old historical neighborhood of Istanbul. Most of the buildings are at least 150-200 years old. Each building has been restored and renovated to fit the criteria of the institution according the Law of Renewal in Turkey. Balat in Istanbul's Fatih district is among the city's oldest neighborhoods, dating back to well before the Byzantine period. Part of the district is included on the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the historic areas of Istanbul, within the Golden Horn harbor area. UNESCO is regenerating the area to retain the old heritage of these historical sites. Plato in conjunction with the municipality is restoring these buildings for the expansion of the Balat Campus in this area. Most of the employees of the Balat Campus are employed from this area.

The Company began commercial operations in July 2003. The Company has asked IFC to provide a senior loan of up to US$65 million to finance the Companys acquisition of a 3G license, capital expenditures to roll-out the 3G network and make debt repayments (the Project).","","","","",The key environmental and social (E&S) issues associated with the project are construction of new facilities; health and safety for workers and community members; pollution prevention and abatement; security services; and community engagement.  Details are contained in the Environmental and Social Review Summary for this project.,"(i) Enhance use of telecommunication services in a low income country, through the roll-out of a 3G network, which will enable more people to access to broadband data services especially given Afghanistan's low fixed line penetration of less than 0.2%.(ii) Expand geographic coverage: While approximately 60% of the population is within reach of its network, Roshan is planning to extend service further to rural and untapped areas, with a population coverage target of 80% in five years.(iii) Extend economic opportunity and financial inclusion to all Afghans: Roshan's M-Paisa service has provided, since 2008, the Afghan population with mobile banking services, such as money transfers, bill payments and salary payments to the unbanked population in the country.  There are approximately 130,000 M-Paisa users and with the introduction of better quality 3G technology, the number of users is expected to grow to approximately 1.3 million by the end of 2016.(iv) Improve the well-being of people in Afghanistan through its corporate social program, Roshan Community: Roshan will continue to develop and financially support a wide range of programs aimed at improving the well-being of the people of Afghanistan that are focused on six main areas: healthcare, education, commerce, social welfare, arts & culture and the environment. (v) Provide political risk mitigation: In view of the increasing challenging security situation in Afghanistan coupled with the planned withdrawal of troops in 2014, country risk and security concerns continue to be the primary barriers to foreign investment in Afghanistan. By supporting this project, IFC is expected to send a positive signal to potential investors that it is possible to finance infrastructure projects in Afghanistan.","","","(i) Financial support to a priority post-conflict country: Due to decades of war and complete lack of foreign investment, Afghanistan is today one of the world's poorest countries with a per capita GDP of about US$500. About 97% of the population is unbanked and access to finance for large corporate remains extremely difficult. In this context, IFC will play a key role in providing financial support to a growing company with limited access to funding from private commercial banks. <br>(ii) Long-term financing: Long-term funding from private sources is extremely limited in Afghanistan. IFC's provision of long-term debt is critical for Roshan to help finance the 3G license acquisition and capital expenditures required for the network roll-out. As well, extending the tenor of Roshan's debt will provide the Company with greater operational flexibility.","","","Incorporated under the laws of Afghanistan and headquartered in Kabul, Roshan is 100% owned by Telecom Development Company Afghanistan B.V.

In addition, the Group is also planning to develop a greenfield food manufacturing facility (food facility) in Nigeria.  The Wings Group is headquartered in Indonesia where it has various operations and the Group commissioned its first powder detergent facility in Nigeria in September 2007. This facility is located at Igbessa in the OPIC Industrial Estate situated in Ogun State some 40 kilometers from central Lagos.  The Project is being constructed on an adjacent 3.6 ha site and is expected to be commissioned in August 2013. This facility is being implemented under a Nigerian registered company, Natural Prime Resources Nigeria Ltd. (Natural Prime) which is majority owned by Wings. The Group is still in the preliminary stages of designing the food facility with limited information on the project currently available. However, Wings has extensive experience in such operations in Indonesia and is assessing various possible locations for this facility.   While all Performance Standards are applicable to this investment, IFCs environmental and social due diligence indicates that the investment will have impacts which must be managed in a manner consistent with the following Performance Standards (PS) dated April 2012:PS 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks and ImpactsPS 2: Labor and Working ConditionsPS 3: Resource Efficiency and Pollution PreventionPS 4: Community Health, Safety and SecurityPS 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural ResourcesThe Project is located within an established industrial area and the land was acquired on a willing buyer-willing seller basis. In addition, this land had been previously cleared and developed. Thus PS 5: Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement, PS 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources and PS 8 Cultural Heritage do not apply to the Project.   The land for the new food facility is still to be identified. Thus PS 5, PS 6 and PS 8 may all, or individually, apply to this project.  Once the land has been identified, Wings will engage with IFC to confirm the approach to the assessment of this facility and the extent to which the PSs apply to this component will determined at that time.   Palm oil will likely be required in the manufacturing process for the food facility and thus there is the potential that such oil could be sourced from areas contributing to significant conversion of natural and/or critical habitats.

Muyuan Loan,Investment,Summary of Investment Information (AIP Policy 2012),Completed,East Asia and the Pacific,China,"MUYUAN FOODS CO., LTD.","Gbl Ind, Manufact, Agribus & Services",2012-12-10T05:00:00Z,2013-01-14T05:00:00Z,B,Loan,"Project Description: Muyuan Foodstuff Co., Ltd. (Muyuan Foodstuff) is a pig breeder and hog producer located in China. IFCs proposed loan investment of $20M will primarily support the development of a Project of the Company to allow for annual production of 300,000 hogs. Upon completion, this Project would expand further Muyuan Foodstuffs hog production.","","","","","Social and Environmental Assessment:All facilities currently under construction have been subject to an EIA. Documents reviewed associated with the EIA process (the EIA approval and comment document from the relevant government authority) provided for Muyuan Foodstuff to begin construction of the projects; they also highlight the E&S issues that are expected to be of the greatest importance and hence prioritized by Muyuan Foodstuff for management. Issues such as wastewater management, for example, are singled out. Management programThe operational requirements of Muyuan Foodstuff farms are managed by a central corporate office. Through 2009, Muyuan Foodstuff operated an informal environmental and social assessment and management system. This has now been formalized culminating in the system being independently certified in 2010 to ISO 14001:2004 with a scope that includes operating farms, feed mill production and associated management activities.  The Environmental Management Manual (a key part of the ISO 14001 EMS) is a high level structural document that makes reference to a variety of procedures which are applied, as needed, at each facility. Muyuan Foodstuffs current plans do not include obtaining an OHSAS 18001 management system certification; however, Muyuan Foodstuff has developed a policy and various operating procedures for the management of OHS issues within its operations. All operating farms are certified to the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) standard; in addition the feed mill is certified to ISO 22000. The production department is responsible for animal welfare. Muyuan Foodstuff  is judged to have exemplary standards for the vast majority of animal welfare issues, including animal handling, feeding systems, nutrition, animal health and transport. The housing of sows, however, is the one area that could be subject to a change in practice to better align it with contemporary practices in the industry elsewhere in the world. In recognition of this opportunity, the company has been piloting a new approach based upon the use of Electronic Sow Feeding (ESF) systems supplied from Europe and designed to provide more room for the animals while providing them individually tailored nutrition that promotes productivity. This pilot scheme is in keeping with other pig producers in the country who are trying out this approach and, as noted above, is a practice already adopted in other countries. Organizational capacityThe Service Department assumes responsibility for environmental management; occupational health and safety; maintenance, construction and development; electricity and water utilities; landscaping; and, catering.  The Environmental Management Unit within this department comprises 24 employees who oversee the work of full time farm-level environmental coordinators (3 to 5 persons per farm depending on the farm size).  The OHS Unit has  6 staff who oversees health and safety management within the company from the corporate level.  At the farm-level, there are 25 individuals who, amongst other duties, are tasked with coordinating OH&S management. These coordinators are also involved in the monthly safety inspections at the farms (a comprehensive company-wide undertaking). They also conduct daily and weekly safety inspections. The mill manager is ultimately responsible for OHS matters at that operation; a safety supervisor (a group leader position) provides day to day implementation support.  Muyuan Foodstuff has dedicated farm/project-level safety personnel for the construction sites who are trained by the local authority on construction site safety; they are managed from the Construction Unit within the Service Department. Monitoring and ReportingThe Company uses pre-qualified and licensed consultants to collect environmental data from various operations. This data is used internally to understand existing operations but is also used in the EIA process to characterize proposed projects. A previously developed Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project involved building biogas digesters for the farms; this required the Company to monitor emissions from bio digesters so as to manage their operation. Data collected as part of that project has since been used as a basis for subsequent biogas developments at all other farms.  PS2 Labor and Working ConditionsOrganizational capacityThe total workforce is thousands of which approximately 80% are farm workers located on the pig breeding and production farms. The Human Resource Department is managed by 9 staff responsible for application of HR policy, procedures and administration.  Activities of the Department are guided by a HR Manual. This manual is currently being updated to include sections on working hours, benefits, staff grievance mechanism, staff training and development, safety, and a code of conduct. Worker Welfare The majority of farm workers are recruited from the local population in the immediate vicinity of the farm. The minimum age for employment is 18 years. All workers sign a standard written contract with Muyuan Foodstuff. Workers are essentially paid on a production basis; average monthly wage is more than 2,000 RMB. In addition, all employees receive social insurance (which covers pension, unemployment, medical, injury, and maternity) and 11 days of public holidays in accordance to the regulatory requirements.  Given biosecurity concerns and lengthy quarantine periods associated with gaining access to and working in the farms, farmers are provided with no-cost accommodation on the farm and subsidized meals in the canteen. Farm workers are required to work irregular hours determined by the pig production cycle (i.e., farrowing, weaners, growers).  Worker Health and Safety Muyuan Foodstuff uses third party contractors for the construction of new farms. Contractors recruit workers from local villages for construction work. Health and safety issues are jointly managed by the Company and Contractor personnel. The workers receive training for health and safety requirements related to construction activities from Muyuan Foodstuff safety personnel as well as the contractor.  Construction operations are regularly inspected for adherence to required health and safety practices by local authorities. Muyuan Foodstuff conducts annual health check up of all farm workers in accordance with standard international practice. Fire safety control measures are required for the feed mill under Chinese regulation.  Biogas facilities are constructed with fire safety precautions built-in such as water seal containers.  PS3 Pollution Prevention and AbatementEach farm is equipped with a bio digestion system to treat manure and preclude the need for effluent discharge to surface waters. Solid waste from the bio-digestion process is provided free-of-charge to farmers for use as fertilizer.  The Company utilizes coal as fuel for hot water boilers, steam boilers, and cooking activities in the dormitory/ canteen.  The hot water boilers at the farms are equipped with cyclones for dust removal from the coal burning process. Muyuan Foodstuff  has begun development of procedures to manage centralized and farm-level facilities for storage of medicines and chemicals; this procedure will be enhanced to include reference to better storage practices, hazards to be identified and emergency measures to be determined. This is addressed in the ESAP.  Used syringes, needles and vaccine containers used for animal care are centrally managed and disposed of by high temperature disinfection and land disposal. The company will maintain records on types and amounts of waste disposal going forward, as set forth in the ESAP.       PS4 Community Health, Safety and SecurityMuyuan Foodstuff farms are located in rural areas throughout Neixiang County. Muyuan Foodstuffs site selection and screening criteria are used to identify sites located on poor quality agricultural lands distant from settlements. Muyuan Foodstuff has implemented strict biosecurity procedures on all its farms.  Farms are fully fenced and gated thereby restricting access. All vehicular access to and movement within farms requires passage through dips. Muyuan Foodstuff has developed various emergency response plans to address potential emergencies including fire and biogas leakage.The feed mill located in Neixiang County is surrounded by commercial and residential establishments.  Previously, fire protection/ control measures within the mill was observed to be minimal, including the lack of fire alarm system and appropriate dust control.  Muyuan Foodstuff since conducted a comprehensive safety assessment/ review for its feed mill operation. Whereas most of the recommended corrective actions have now been completed, those remaining regarding prevention of explosions and some fire prevention requirements remain to be finally closed out; the completion of these recommended items is addressed in the ESAP.","mployment: The Company''s operations are located in Province - a frontier region in China. It provides stable employment opportunities for thousands, including  female employees.Farmers reached: Currently, a significant number of rural households supply the Company with raw materials such as corn, barley and silage.   SMEs reached:  Company sells its breeds to rural pig farms for further fattening for sale to market. Food Safety:  The Chinese hog sector is still very fragmented, leading to poor hygiene standards, inadequate bio-security, poor nutrition, and over-use of antibiotics. By creating a larger enterprise with greater focus on efficiency and food safety, the Company supports the improvement of breeding techniques, quality standards as well as the production efficiency of the industry.","","","Long-term partner:  Muyuan Foodstuff is keen to attract financing from credible/knowledgeable partners such as IFC who have a long-term investment horizon and can add value to the operations through our industry knowledge and enable the Company implement a properly designed strategic plan.<br>Credibility and Positioning: Muyuan Foodstuff expects the signaling from IFC''s direct investment will enhance its reputation with investors and other partners. <br>Adoption of Best-Practice Operational Standards: By supporting the deployment of environmentally friendly, energy-efficient pig farms yielding quality pigs, Muyuan Foodstuff can have a positive, visible demonstration effect for improving the operational management standards in the Chinese pig industry.","","",The Company is privately held.,"The total Project cost is estimated to be RMB300 million (approx.

These includes impacts like occupational health & safety concerns, labour and working conditions, fire and life safety, construction related E&S risks, waste and pollution management and possibly land and biodiversity impacts depending on the nature and location of the investments to be made by the bank. Additionally, there is a likelihood of social risks and impacts in case of agriculture related projects in the country. The bank has an E&S risk management system in place. The bank was found to be in compliance with IFC''s requirements of PS-2 on Labour and Working Conditions.","Market Signal: JBIC''s involvement in the Project sends an important market signal to international investors endorsing Sri Lanka as an investment target. This will have a key impact on FDI flows particularly at a time when the country is emerging from a 26 year civil war and there is ongoing uncertainty in global financial markets.Strengthen Systemic Impact: A stronger capital base will enable CBC to enhance its systemic contribution to finance the post-conflict reconstruction efforts in the North and East of the country and infrastructure projects identified as a national priority to accelerate economic growth.Increased Access to Finance: CBC is a major SME lender in Sri Lanka, comprising nearly a third of its portfolio. The Project will provide additional funding for the SME sector, which is a key driver of economic growth, and the tangible development outcome of this financing will be monitored through the incremental increase in the Bank''s SME portfolio.Promote Regional Integration: The Project will help promote regional economic integration by supporting the expansion of CBC''s expansion of its regional presence.Optimize Capital Structure of Banks: The Project meets a key priority of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in raising Tier 2 capital to optimize the capital structure of key domestic banks. Tier 2 capital is relatively new in Sri Lanka and nor widely prevalent since weak market conditions have precluded banks from readily accessing subordinated debt.","","",Address Market Failure: There is a clear role for IFC/AMC in addressing market failure by providing large ticket equity funding otherwise unavailable from commercial investors due to limited absorptive capacity in domestic capital markets and global investor uncertainty in the aftermath of the recent financial crises.<br><br>Introduction of a new Investor: The introduction of JBIC as an indirect new investor consequent to the AMC funding will be beneficial for the Bank.

Due to its dominant role in the market, it is expected to pitch its share of support in the future growth in the country, especially in infrastructure, tourism, agriculture, retail financing in the North and East. It also has banking operations in Bangladesh. CBCs asset book is diversified across retail, SME, corporate and project finance. As a strategic client of IFC, with investment and advisory relationships dating back to 2003, CBC is the ideal partner with regard to IFCs priority initiatives for Sri Lanka which range from supporting the growth of SMEs to the reconstruction and development of the Northern and Eastern provinces of the country.The Bank is listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange.

In this proposed Project, IFC would take credit risk in a loan portfolio to be originated and funded by the Bank. The Project is expected to receive support from the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and Chinese Central Government.","","","","","The main E&S risks and impacts of the project derive from the E&S risks of the RSF target loans, the capacity and systems in place to manage these risks, and BOBs practices with regard to labor and working conditions. At present BOB has developed an Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) for undertaking E&S risk management of its lending activities. However, its implementation of the ESMS for the RSF portfolio will need to be strengthened by incorporating proper E&S review and monitoring in the loan review process and providing additional training to the staff involved in ESMS implementation. BOB will be required to comply with relevant Chinese labor laws and regulations and the requirements of IFC Performance Standard 2 on Labor and Working conditions.","(i)	Environmental benefit:  Upon full ramp-up for the Project, 233,000 tons of CO2 emission and 600,000 cubic meters of water is estimated to be reduced per year; (ii)	SME access to finance:  Upon full ramp-up for the Project, at least 44 SME borrowers will be financed.  (iii)	Demonstration effect: 1) encourage governments to participate in future public private partnership initiatives of this type, within and beyond China; 2) generate a broader market impact and demonstrate the viability of energy efficiency and water efficiency projects; and 3) catalyze financial institutions to offer sustainable energy/water financing to SMEs;(iv)  Capacity building: (1) promote the improvement of industry-specific loan underwriting process/procedure and strengthen risk management practices; and (2) increase the Bank''s capacity to analyze and finance energy/water efficiency projects;","","","(i) With more than a decade experience in supporting EE financing globally, especially in China through CHUEE, IFC is in the leading position to continue innovation to address major market gaps for SMEs to access funding for EE and RE projects and activities;<br><br>(ii) Using global and China-specific knowledge and expertise in EE/RE financing, unique to IFC and unavailable in the local market, IFC will leverage public and private sources of capital to increase development impact; <br><br>(iii) IFC''s advisory services will be delivered through established platform which has great experience in building banks'' capacity to do EE/RE lending and SME finance;<br><br>(iv) IFC is helping Partner Banks to focus on SMEs, especially those in frontier regions where EE/RE/WE funding is still at a relatively early  stage; <br><br>(v) In the absence of IFC''s participation, it will be very difficult to raise funding for first loss and advisory services, both critical for the success of the Program; and<br><br>(vi) facilitate market absorption of water technologies.","","","The project sponsor is Bank of Beijing.
