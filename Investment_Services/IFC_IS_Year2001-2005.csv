Avalon Professional Web Trade Pte. Ltd.,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,East Asia and the Pacific,Philippines,AVALON PROFESSIONAL WEB TRADE PTE. LTD.,"Gbl Ind, Manufact, Agribus & Services",2001-01-03T05:00:00Z,2001-02-04T05:00:00Z,B,Equity,"APW is a new trading company, based in Singapore, that sources purchase orders (POs) for home furnishings from US buyers, and subcontracts production on the POs to SME manufacturers, that form part of the APW network, in the Philippines. The APW network is comprised of SME furniture manufacturers that are prequalified by APW, based on their product quality, production reliability, environmental standards, size, export experience, proprietor quality and various other criteria. The SMEs, that are part of the APW network, benefit from APW''s marketing activities abroad as well as financing for pre-export activities such as raw material procurement and labor cost.  APW''s expansion plan includes extending the APW network to China, Indonesia and Thailand. This expansion strategy will enable APW to offer a product line to meet the full market demand ranging from high end, high craftsmanship, high margin products, to lower end, lower margin products, mass produced. Furthermore, the geographic expansion will allow APW to take advantage of raw materials indigenous to each region. This expansive product line supports APW''s strategy to offer international buyers quality products sourced from Asia for competitive prices.IFC''s investment in APW is a pioneering replicable model to promote SME development through broad investment.  APW will: (i) help SMEs obtain much needed working capital financing, presently unavailable due to the SMEs size and lack of collateral;  (ii) increase SME''s market reach; (iii) create a conduit through which SMEs can benefit from volume raw material discounts;  (iv) encourage international buyers to source production from the emerging markets in South East Asia. APW''s local production monitoring provides international buyers additional comfort to outsource such production to the Philippines. APW''s success will translate into growth in furniture exports from Cebu and as APW expands, throughout the region.  Being part of the APW manufacturing network will also promote greater transparency and an adequate level of environmental standards amongst the SMEs. The World Bank''s main focus in the Philippines is poverty reduction facilitated through enhanced economic growth. This project fits well with the World Bank strategy as SMEs are a major source of employment and wage income for a local labor force suffering from high unemployment. IFC''s investment in APW is also consistent with IFC''s strategy to finance SMEs through broad investment rather than directly in the SMEs.  Furthermore, the SME sector is one of the most dynamic sectors essential for the necessary economic growth in the Philippines. Therefore, APW contributes to improve the growth potential of SMEs by providing access to efficient financing and facilitating access to global markets.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project, and the following potential environmental, health and safety impacts of the project were analysed:  development and implementation of an Environmental Management System, implementation of a system for accrediting and monitoring environmental and social status of suppliers, air, water and solid waste emissions, fire safety and emergency response, general worker health and safety and sourcing of sustainable wood supplies.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityAPW will post environmental documents for public review at the Government Building, Governors Office in Cebu city.","The sponsors of APW are listed below.

Probusinessbank,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,Russian Federation,Probusiness Bank,Regional Industry - FIG - ECA,2001-01-03T05:00:00Z,2001-02-06T05:00:00Z,FI,Loan,"Probusinessbank was founded in 1993 as a full service commercial bank by a group of graduates from the top Moscow universities. The initial capital came from companies in the chemical, construction, food production and machinery industries. At the end 1999 it had assets of $92 million and equity of $9 million equivalent. The bank''s business focus is on lending to mid-sized corporates and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).The investment will strengthen Probusinessbank capital base which was seriously eroded as a result of the 1998 crisis in the banking sector. It will also provide long-term funding to support the bank''s business development program, particularly the expansion of lending to mid-sized corporates and SMEs. On a selective basis the bank will also be able to start offering longer maturities to its strongest clients. The investment will be accompanied by a donor-funded program of technical assistance to upgrade the bank''s practices, systems and technologies. Currently there are virtually no commercial sources of long-term funding for Russian-owned banks, unless they belong to one of the big financial industrial groups. IFC''s financing will strengthen Probusinessbank''s balance sheet and provide resources to expand its lending activities without compromising its independence. The financing will be combined with a program of technical assistance to improve the bank''s operations. IFC''s presence as an investor in the bank may also help it attract foreign strategic investors, once the country conditions improve.The Russian financial sector is seriously undeveloped and does not function efficiently either in mobilizing or allocating resources. The resulting shortage of financing is a major constraint to the development of the productive sector of the economy. This project will contribute to rehabilitate and restore confidence in the Russian financial sector by helping a viable bank, that has the potential to become a leader in the commercial banking industry and provide credit to help the development of productive enterprises. It will also stand as a model for other similar institutions to follow its lead. The investment will also allow the bank to increase its lending, with longer maturities, to mid-sized Russian corporates and SMEs, thus supporting a sector of the economy which will be a key to achieving sustained economic growth and generating employment in the next few years.","","","","","","","","","","",This is a category FI Type I project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure.

Indorama Risk Management Facility,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,East Asia and the Pacific,Indonesia,"INDO-RAMA SYNTHETICS, PT TBK","Gbl Ind, Manufact, Agribus & Services",2001-01-04T05:00:00Z,2001-02-15T05:00:00Z,C,Risk Management,"The CompanyPT. Indorama Synthetics Tbk is a successful, export-oriented, internationally competitive manufacturer of polyester filament and spun yarns, polyester fabric and bottle grade PET resin. IFC has made several loans to Indorama and is the second largest shareholder in the company.  Indorama has three main operating divisions:1. Spinning Division - It produces different types and blends of polyester yarns, as well as viscose and acrylic yarns;2. Polyester Division - It includes fibre, yarns (filament and draw-texturized yarns) and PET resin production operations; and3. Fabrics Division - It is a relatively small division that accounts for less than 10% of total revenues. The operations focus on value-added products, both grey fabrics (i.e. unprinted fabrics) and printed fabrics.In 1999, the company produced about 148,000 tons of polyester filament yarn and polyester staple fiber, 31,000 tons of spun yarn, 76,000 tons of PET resin and 22 million meters of grey fabrics. Production levels were consistently equal to, or above, rated capacity for all major production units.  The company is a proven exporter and, in 1999, generated over 60% of its revenues via exports principally to Europe, United States, Australia and the Middle East.  	Indorama has been able to consistently generate operating profits and robust cash flows even through the Asian economic crisis and the adverse economic conditions in Indonesia, which is reflective of its strong operating fundamentals. The company is also current on all its debt obligations. Based on its historical cash flows, liquidity position, and improving debt service coverage, the company appears to be strong from a credit quality perspective. However, with the bunching of debt repayments in the future, the company may face potential difficulties in servicing its debt obligations from internal cash flows. Recognizing this potential problem, Indorama proposes to issue a 5-year bond and refinance some of its existing debt. This would strengthen its future financial position as its future debt service obligations will better match its cash flows.		The ProjectIndorama plans to issue an IDR 1 trillion, 5-year bond in early 2001. The proceeds of the bond issue will be used to (i) prepay, in 2001, the net US$80 million bullet payment, due in March 2002, under the syndicated loan arranged by Deutsche Morgan Grenfell (DMG Loan), and (ii) strengthen the companys working capital needs. The proposed bond issue would strengthen the companys future financial position, as its future debt service obligations will be rescheduled to better match its cash flows. As an export-oriented company with more than 60% of its revenues in US$, Indorama received an approval from BAPEPAM (the Indonesian securities and exchange authority) to report its financial statement in US$.  Historically, Indorama has maintained its assets and liabilities in US$ to avoid any currency mismatches. Therefore, in line with its past practice, Indorama intends to swap the IDR bond proceeds into US$ at the prevailing exchange rate.  Based on Indoramas request, IFC is considering assisting the company in structuring and arranging the aforementioned swap.IFC Role Assist Indonesian Corporate: IFCs strategy in Indonesia focuses on assisting internationally competitive domestic companies to recover from the crisis. This involves assisting IFCs portfolio companies through financial restructuring and, where appropriate, providing additional working capital, long-term funding as well as other financial instruments to maintain necessary balance sheet flexibility and diversify available sources of funding. IFCs endorsement of both existing and new projects should signal to other investors IFCs continuing confidence in the long-term prospects of the Indonesian economy.  Promotion of Risk Management Product: Although clients usually swap IDR payments for US$ payments, this transaction provides the reverse -- it swaps US$ payments for IDR payments as the Company has dollarized accounts.  However, the broad implications of this transaction -- a first for IFC in Indonesia -- will serve as an example of how corporations can manage currency mismatches on their balance sheet and thereby reduce overall risks. Although the Indonesian corporates are seeking such risk management products, they are unable to obtain such products on a cost-effective basis.This ia due to the resistance from swap counterparties to enter into long-term contracts as a result of the high country risk associated with Indonesia. IFC''s intimate knowledge of Indorama''s performance allows us to be comfortable with the credit risk and intermediating swap, thereby allowing Indorama to manage its balance sheet risks in a cost-effective manner.   Development Impact:IFCs investment at this time will have two significant demonstration effects in the decimated Indonesian corporate scene: (i) IFC''s assistance in arranging the swap will send a positive signal to international investors and restore some of the confidence in the Indonesian private sector severely undermined by the Asian economic crisis; and (ii) IFC''s support to Indorama will demonstrate that, in an environment where a majority of companies are not current on their debt service and where implementation of debt restructuring is slow, borrowers who meet their obligations will gain support from the lending community. Furthermore, the introduction, through this project, of a risk management tool for use by Indonesian corporates would be an example of how companies could manage balance sheet exposures to currency mismatches and prevent adverse exposures to currency volatilities.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category C project, according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because it is likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts.Location of environmental documents In locally affected community","The project sponsor is the Lohia Family, which is a well established Indonesian business group of Indian origin.

SPPF is a technical assistance project established in 1990 by the IFC and with financial support from various donors. The mission of SPPF is to assist and accelerate the development of productive, self-sustaining small and medium-sized private sector enterprises (SMEs) in IFC''s Pacific Member Island Countries (PIMCs).  In recognition of the facility''s important contribution to business development in the region, the first SPPF extension was approved in 1995 for a five-year period up to December 31, 2000.Under SPPF III, the facility will pursue the two-fold strategy: (i) to continue to provide direct investment assistance to entrepreneurs; and (ii) to broaden support to SMEs directly and indirectly by introducing, with the SME Departments support, new products and services, utilizing e-business opportunities, thus creating a comprehensive system of small business promotion. To this end, the facility will deliver the following expanded program activities:A.  Enterprise Level Support - through (i) assistance to enterprises in project preparation, in project structuring, and in raising financing; and (ii) broader technical assistance programs to help individual enterprises overcome internal capacity constraints for their development. B. Capacity-building Work and Indirect Assistance by (i) creating sustainable local capacity to deliver SME support services through the strengthening and further development of local agents, consultants, and institutional strengthening targeted at business and industry associations; (ii) promoting financial sector development, focusing on institutional strengthening of funding source and capacity building of financial institutions, through transfer of modern lending techniques (such as cash-flow based loan screening and evaluation systems, risk management and client tracking systems), introduction of new information management systems, and new financial products and services tailored to the SME needs; (iii) expanding access to information technology by engaging the private sector, donors, and investors in determining the best way to facilitate the use of the Internet-based technologies in accessing market and business information, and in delivering Internet promotion training; and (iv) cooperation and contribution to policy dialogue with donors, World Bank and IFC.IFC has taken the lead in designing, funding and managing SPPF. The facility is headed by a Regional Manager, who is a senior staff member seconded from the IFC. IFC provides general administrative and operational guidance (through the SME Department), funding support (through both SME and IFC Trust Funds Departments), technical inputs (through the Industry and Specialists Departments), resource management support (through the Human Resource Department) and back-office accounting (through both the World Bank and IFC Controllers Departments). In addition, the SME Department provides the link between SPPF and IFC, and coordinates SPPF''s operations with other regional development initiatives in the Bank Group. This relationship gives SPPF access to IFC''s unique expertise in small business development and ensures cross-fertilization, through transfer of knowledge and best practices, among the existing facilities and other SME programs in the Bank Group. The IFCs ten Pacific Islands Member Countries (PIMCs) are relatively small, open economies with limited diversification and institutional capacity. They are vulnerable to external economic and environmental shocks, and have limited or non-existent access to global capital markets. Despite very high inflows of aid, economic performance in the PIMCs has been modest and varied considerably across the countries. The structure of PIMCs economies reflects domination of the public sector and the role of private sector has remained small. Apart from being crowded out by the government, the private sector has also been constrained by lack of human capacity, difficulties in obtaining secure access to land due to traditional land tenure practices, and difficulties in obtaining access to finance. In addition, the remoteness and isolation of the countries from major centers of trade and commerce makes it more difficult to compensate for the limited domestic markets. High transportation and infrastructure costs limit business opportunities. Through its activities for enterprise level support, capacity-building, and dissemination of best practices, SPPF will continue to work towards alleviating these constraints to private SMEs development. In addition, the facility will continue to build a sustainable local capacity to deliver the type of services SPPF would be providing.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category C project according to IFC''s Procedures for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because it is likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impact.

IFC would provide US$ 2.1 million, about 20% of the total funding requirements.Fundraising for SPPF III was discussed during the November 1999 donors meeting.

The construction of a local dairy, which would meet hygiene and environmental standards, will support the development of this branch of the Mauritanian food-processing industry.-Agriculture: collecting milk from small and medium-sized producers at different places in Mauritania (up to 200km from Nouakchott) will contribute to providing those populations with a regular income. Consequently, they will be led to improve the quality and size of their production.-Gender promotion: TiviskiI S.A.R.L. is managed by a woman.

Mozal I, to which IFC has existing loan commitments totalling US$120 million, has already produced first metal and is currently nearing completion, six months ahead of schedule and at about US$130 million below the budgeted project cost of US$1,340 million. Mozal I was designed with the Mozal II expansion in mind. In the existing site there is space for the installation of duplicate potline, anode baking, and casthouse facilities. Outside the main site, the only significant additional facilities required will be a second ship unloader and storage facilities at the port -all to be constructed within the existing boundaries of Mozal''s quay- to handle the extra raw materials, and an extra 132kV transmission line from the nearby substation. The project will have significant development impact. Mozambique''s net foreign exchange earnings will increase by over US$100 million, and GDP will increase by an estimated 3.5%. During construction, the project will employ an estimated 5,000 people, with 295 direct and 1,500 indirect jobs being created during operation. Opportunities for local small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) are expected to be created through Mozal''s policy of out-sourcing all non-core activities to local companies. The import of project inputs from South Africa should further stimulate regional trade and integration. Lastly, with an expected annual spending of the order of US$2 million on social and community initiatives, the Mozal Trust will work to ensure the sustainability of the project''s impact on the local people. IFC''s role will be to: co-ordinate all the lenders for the approximately US$600 million debt package; ensure that the project meets IFC''s environmental and social policies and guidelines; encourage SME development around the project; and, through its continued investment in the country, provide reassurance to potential investors in other Mozambican projects.","","","","","","","","","","","This is an environmental and social review category A project.

TV Africa,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Africa,Africa Region,Africa Media Group Limited,"TMT, Venture Capital & Funds",2001-02-09T05:00:00Z,2001-03-31T05:00:00Z,B,Equity,"TV Africa is a content provider that offers its affiliates high quality programming in exchange for: a) airtime in which to place network and regional advertising that is sold directly by TV Africa; and b) a share of the local advertising revenue that is generated by the affiliates themselves. The company''s network currently provides advertisers and sponsors with a single point of access to a pan-African audience. It also offers access to audiences on a regional basis.IFC''s financing would assist TV Africa with its ongoing development program by providing capital with which the company can finance the strengthening of its affiliate network, purchase and produce content, secure programming rights, put in place infrastructure, and finance start up costs and working capital requirements. TV Africa estimates that it will require up to US$40 million of equity financing and IFC has been asked to provide up to US$10 million of this amount to complete the financing plan. The balance of the financing requirement will be provided by other institutional investors. Development Impact:TV Africa will assist in the development of local programming content.  One of the key success factors of TV Africa is its ability to deliver quality local programming content, which is desired by TV Africas viewers, potential advertisers and affiliates. TV Africa intends to develop further its local content through a combination of co-production, commissions and the acquisition of rights. This will lead to the strengthening of a number of firms involved in the writing, producing and processing of such content. These firms are often small and medium sized enterprises, which provide employment to a large proportion of the African creative talent not employed by governments.TV Africa will help to strengthen its affiliate partners. In Africas recently liberalised television market, private sector operators are generally undercapitalised and financially weak. Unable to acquire quality programming, these companies often lack the technical and managerial ability to operate as successful commercial TV stations. Affiliation with TV Africa enables these small operators to address their problems by obtaining: a) technical advice, in order to address their technical and managerial shortcomings; b) access to a broader audience, thus increasing the rates at which advertising can be sold; c) an increase in transmission hours, at little extra cost, augmenting their potential revenue.  Moreover, being part of the TV Africa network also encourages cooperation between affiliates (for example in sharing equipment).TV Africa will continue to provide educational programming and take part in HIV/AIDS and other health and social awareness campaigns. TV Africa currently provides up to 5 hours per day of educational programming. This programming, which has a strong following in a number of countries, covers a wide range of areas, including a high school equivalency program and subjects such as finance, accounting, and computing. In addition, TV Africa also airs programming aimed at increasing awareness about HIV/AIDS and other health and social issues. In connection with the last World AIDS Day, TV Africa  aired various documentaries about the disease and carried AIDS-related public service announcements prepared by the World Bank and UNAIDS. TV Africa is a platform for public service announcements.  TV Africa is currently used by various NGOs and various bi- and multi-lateral organizations as a vehicle for public service announcements on various issues.TV Africa will assist in the media liberalization process currently underway in a number of African countries.  By strengthening the competitive position of its affiliates, introducing economies of scale in the production and acquisition of programming, and creating regional markets for advertising, TV Africa will contribute to the development of sustainable competitors in the newly liberalized African media market.  This will in turn provide broader access to high quality programming in a continent where less than 0.5% of the owners of television sets have access to pay-TV options such as satellite and cable TV, to date the only conduits of such high quality programming. Such programming will provide viewers with a greater diversity of sources of information, while helping to break the monopolies of the state-owned broadcasting companies.IFC''s RoleIFC will provide the necessary funding. Given the perceived risks of investing in Africa and the scarcity of telecommunications and media investments on the world''s major markets, without IFCs assistance it would be difficult to raise the large scale funds necessary for an investment such as TV Africa.  If IFC does not participate in the proposed investment, it is likely that funding would be delayed, setting back the project.IFC will act as a catalyst. The other major potential investors in TV Africa have made it clear that they would take great comfort from IFC''s presence and the added value that the Corporation''s participation would provide. For these reasons, they will be much more likely to proceed with their investments in TV Africa if IFC decides to go ahead.IFC will ensure that some important development benefits are realized. TV Africa has indicated its willingness to work with IFC to optimize the company''s developmental benefits, should IFC go ahead with the proposed investment.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines, or design criteria.

Since it opened its doors in 1995, Bilgis student enrollment increased five-fold, from 914 to over 5,000 students.  At the same time, its faculty increased from 70 to 339.  It has achieved this growth by providing first-class social science instruction to a mostly urban population that thrives on the university which offers a variety of traditional core courses, as well as courses in communications, film and television and jazz.  The University serves its urban community by providing free instruction in English, accounting, and computer training.  It also has film festivals, produces shows for local TV stations, and promotes art exhibits. IFC Role: Turkeys financial sector has been unable to provide adequate local currency financing to support long-term investments, especially for not-for-profit institutions.  Financing for these institutions is limited to short-term loans at high spreads or leasing because they are considered frontier sectors and risk assessment is complicated by their not-for-profit status.  Yet they provide important social services that are directly linked to improving the social capital of the country.  Consequently, the role of IFC is especially important, as it is the only major source of long-term project financing for these clients.  With this first investment in a private university in Turkey, IFC would demonstrate the financial viability of these institutions, structuring innovate ways for securing its loans, while applying some governance measures commonly found in well-managed private companies.   Economic Benefits/Development Impacts: IFCs investment in education will help speed the diffusion of best practices to the public education system.  IFC is emphasizing investments that will deliver quality education in a cost-efficient manner.  The focus is on projects that will enhance competition and best practices, while increasing places for students across the system and relieving the pressures for additional places in the public university system. The Bilgi expansion is serving a growing demand for higher education in Turkey.  Growing numbers of secondary school graduates and a relatively strong private sector are creating ample numbers of applicants for Bilgis program. Bilgi University has so far contributed over US$5.0 million in kind to the three neighborhoods where its campuses are located.  These have taken the form of English language and computer training, training in accounting and teacher training.  In addition, Bilgi donated a primary school to the municipality.  Since 1998, over 1,500 participants have benefited from Bilgis community programs.  In addition, several small businesses, catering to students needs, have flourished in the neighborhoods where the campuses are located, and public services, such as transportation and housing, have improved.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines, or design criteria.

Currently, even though homebuilders hold about 75% of the shareholding, less than 20% of Su Casitas business is originated with its shareholders. Since its founding, the company has obtained its financial support almost exclusively from a trust fund administered by the Central Bank of Mexico called FOVI, which has a particular focus on housing for low-income families.  FOVI current regulations limit the price of the homes sofoles can finance to a maximum of US$45,000.Over the past six years, Su Casita has experienced rapid expansion. It has grown the scope of its operations as measured by its physical presence and by its balance sheet. As of December 2000, it had 375 employees in 45 offices in 23 states, now covering most of Mexico.  It held approximately US$428 million of mortgage loans, up from US$34 million at year end 1996, representing an annual compounded rate of growth of 150%.  It is currently in the process of merging with Financiamiento Azteca (Finazte), another mortgage Sofol. The new entity will retain the name Hipotecaria Su Casita. The project consists of creating and issuing Mexicos first significant mortgage-backed securitization (MBS). It will be issued on behalf of Hipotecaria Su Casita which will use the proceeds of the bond offering to make mortgage loans to an under-served market segment of lower middle class families. IFC will invest in the mezzanine piece, or the B bonds.IFC will play a critical and unique role in support of this first significant MBS issue in Mexico. As a new class of security, investors will be wary of investment performance and untested legal structures. By taking a mezzanine bond, IFC will provide investment confidence to senior bond investors, and assure rating agencies of adequate credit support for the transaction. In addition, IFCs involvement will be part of a larger strategy to help develop the mortgage and capital markets in Mexico. The creation and issuance of this first deal is an important proof of concept step towards the overall goal of development of an active and liquid secondary mortgage market in the country. Finally, IFC will be playing an important role in supporting the growth of open-market institutions and in showing mortgage originators alternative funding avenues.  This securitization will generate funds for new open-market (non-FOVI funded) lending, expanding the reach of Su Casita in particular and of Sofoles in general.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category FI - Type 1.

The company will be the first  nation-wide infrastructure equipment services company in India. The IIEL project is expected to further accelerate the process of mechanisation in the Indian infrastructure construction sector by providing contractors an alternative way of accessing high-quality and expensive equipment. Increased mechanisation will, in turn, have a strong bearing on improving the quality of infrastructure construction, better maintenance, and reduced delays in infrastructure project implementation. As an infrastructure-enabling service company, IIELs initial business focus will be on supplying specialised equipment for the road sector, multiple-use equipment for construction of roads, irrigation, dams, and pipelines, and high-value general-purpose equipment. Specialised equipment is expected to be rented by medium-sized and large contractors for short periods.  General-purpose equipment is expected to be rented by medium-sized and large contractors as back up during project peak loads or equipment breakdowns, and by small and medium-sized contractors who intend to bid for larger projects but are restricted because of capital constraints.The project is highly innovative and timely in the Indian market and is expected to pioneer the Indian infrastructure equipment rental sector.  Realising the importance of the infrastructure sector in fuelling future economic growth, over the last five years, the Indian government has increased its focus on modernising and upgrading the infrastructure sector (including urging the contractors to use more sophisticated and suitable infrastructure equipment by inserting minimum equipment specifications and requirements in documents inviting bids). Over the same period, several equipment manufacturers have either acquired or established manufacturing units in India. The availability of locally manufactured or assembled infrastructure construction equipment combined with an increasing investment volume in the infrastructure sector are key factors in making the project concept attractive in India. IFC has played a pivotal role in helping IIEL develop and structure a sound and comprehensive environmental management system (EMS). The EMS would comprise innovative features such as the establishment of an environmental advisory board (EAB) to ensure that IIEL equipment is not provided to projects which do not meet minimum environmental criteria. The EAB would comprise of independent environmental specialists who can inform IIEL management on controversial projects and give advise on how to handle potential environmental issues. IIELs adoption and use of the EMS is expected to have a strong demonstration effect in terms of encouraging Indian contractors and project promoters to focus on better environmental practices. Contractors and project promoters who are less stringent on environmental requirements, would have to rely on more expensive financing methods to get access to the equipment, which could result in higher project costs and/or non-competitive bids. IFC has also played a significant advisory role in helping the sponsors refine and elaborate the project concept, develop a robust financial structure, and identify and structure risk mitigation mechanisms. Moreover, IFC has actively assisted IIEL in its efforts to sell the project concept to other international financial institutions. IFCs presence as an investor will further help IIEL attract other investors and sources of funding.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognised performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected community SREI Office""Vishwakarma 86 CTopsia Road (South)Calcutta 700 046.","The project sponsors and major shareholders of Indian Infrastructure Equipment Limited (IIEL or the company) are the Kanoria family and its associates (Kanoria family) and SREI International Finance Limited and its subsidiaries  (SREI).

Mahindra Infrastructure Company,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,South Asia,India,MAHINDRA INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPERS LIMITED,Regional Industry - INF Asia & Pac,2001-03-02T05:00:00Z,2001-04-02T04:00:00Z,B,Equity,"Description of CompanyMahInfra is a new company that will be incorporated in India prior to the IFC investment. It would be an infrastructure holding company that will be formed as a result of a spin-off of MRIDL''s Infrastructure Privatization Group. Purpose of Project The project involves an IFC equity investment in a new company in India, which would develop, finance and operate infrastructure projects.  At the outset, the company will take over two infrastructure projects which are currently being undertaken by MRIDL. The projects are as follows:(i) SOFTOP: Mahindra Knowledge Park is a US$55.6 million greenfield industrial park development in the Mohali suburb of Chandigarh, the capital city of Punjab. It is in an area which houses other industrial parks, complexes and residential compounds. The project aims to develop a 15 acre site into a software technology park which will attract research and technology enterprises by offering modern facilities, well-developed data and communications links as well as financial / tax incentives. At present, the plot in Mohali has been allocated and an architectural firm has been selected for master planning. There is an accessible road to the park, where construction is expected to begin in June 2001, and another road which circumscribes the entire rectangular plot;(ii) Tirupur Water is a greenfield bulk water supply and distribution project in Tirupur, a mid-sized municipality in Tamil Nadu. Tirupur is an industrial town covering 27 square kilometers located 450 kilometers from the state capital, Chennai. The current population of the Tirupur municipality and the surrounding area covered by the project is estimated at 270,000 and 414,000 persons respectively. The US$287 million project involves the construction and operation of a potable water supply system that will abstract at least 185 million litres of water a day of water from the River Cauvery. The water will be treated and transmitted to (i) industrial and household consumers in the municipality of Tirupur; (ii) household consumers in 792 habitations spread over 4 Panchayat Unions, 4 Town Panchayats and 15 Village Panchayats; and (iii) industrial consumers (textiles) in the surrounding area. MahInfra will invest in India''s infrastructure industry, mainly but not exclusively in the following sectors: (1) water supply and wastewater management, (2) solid waste management, (3) transportation and logistics, (4) industrial parks and (5) power generation and distribution. It will play various roles in the projects it invests in, including the roles of developer, financier, operator and manager. Development ImpactThe company will have a significant development impact by bringing private sector investment to India''s poorly managed infrastructure sector.  This, in turn, should improve the quality of service and give access to the much needed infrastructure facilities to a larger percentage of the population. Better transportation facilities, water, wastewater services, and industrial parks will help reduce transportation costs, increase employment opportunities and strengthen local  social and environmental practices. The company''s investments will also develop the economies where projects are located and provide an infrastructure network that will make India a more attractive emerging market for foreign investment.  IFC RoleMahInfra will be IFC''s first investment in India''s water and transport infrastructure sectors. The development of local companies, where appropriate with international technical expertise, is the only real solution to sustained development of the infrastructure sector. The company wants to tap IFC''s experience in determining appropriate project structures, their financial viability and risk profiles. The proposed investment would give IFC the opportunity to get involved in infrastructure projects in India at the structuring stage. IFC''s presence in MahInfra would demonstrate the Corporation''s commitment to the infrastructure sector in India and enable IFC to have a stronger role in demonstrating the benefits of a more market-based concession criteria. Participation in the MahInfra investment would also allow IFC to reach and influence a number of smaller infrastructure projects, which IFC may not have been able to participate in directly. Lastly, IFCs investment in MahInfra would provide IFC with the ability to promote greater sustainability and social responsibility with respect to India''s infrastructure projects.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityThe environmental documents will be available in the following three locations:1.

The sponsor of the project, GCIG sees a significant role for IFC as a partner in the proposed venture. At the level of the holding company, IFC will bring long-standing experience as an investor in the financial sector of emerging markets through representation on the company''s board. GCIG also values the local market knowledge and contacts of IFC staff in specific countries, and in some circumstances IFC will co-invest with the holding company and have direct representation on the investee company''s board. Credit insurance is a new or under-developed product in most markets where the holding company will be investing. Often the legal/regulatory framework will present impediments to the establishment of a sound, competitive credit insurance industry (e.g. limitations on insurance companies'' credit risk cover activities, insufficient legal infrastructure to permit efficient debt collection efforts, etc.).  IFC will help local insurance regulators and other authorities to address these impediments. The project should have a strong development impact. Credit insurance, and other information-intensive products and services such as credit scoring and credit bureaus, encourage financial institutions to move ""down-market"" profitably by lowering unit transaction costs, strengthening risk management, and improving their ability to tailor services for specific market segments, especially SMEs.The project enables IFC to help authorities of member countries create appropriate legal and regulatory framework for undertaking credit insurance, which would often benefit not only credit insurance per se, but banking and financial services in general. The project is complementary to other IFC Financial Markets efforts to strengthen the credit infrastructure of emerging markets, including the e-finance initiative.  In addition, use of credit insurance by emerging markets firms that face cash/liquidity constraints will reduce trade risk associated with their balance sheets, making them more easily financeable.Credit insurance will increase financing options for emerging markets companies because it is a viable alternative to factoring, forfaiting, and letters of credit/bank guarantees, in order to manage trade risks.  Credit insurance has advantages over factoring and forfaiting in that long-standing producer-customer relationships are maintained. Credit insurance also can have advantages over Letters of credit/bank guarantees, which impose costs on and may reduce the financial flexibility of buyers.Promotion of other products and services that are ""embedded"" in basic credit insurance cover - but that are often not well developed as stand-alone offerings in emerging markets (e.g. account receivables servicing/management, invoicing, collection management, legal actions or other types of debt collection activities) - is likely to occur if international credit insurers expand their business activities in these countries.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category C project, according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because it is likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts.Location of environmental documents In locally affected community","The two shareholders in Gerling Emerging Markets Credit Insurance S.A.

First of all, it will produce high quality pasta at lower prices, thus reducing the need of imports. The much needed hard currency will therefore remain in the country. Second, about 30 new jobs will be created. Also the increasing use of wheat will allow local farmers to stabilize their operations by having a strong and continuous  buyer. Finally, state of the art pasta production technology will be introduced to the country and therefore, over time the skill level of local employees will increase substantially. For the refurbishment of the building and site local constructing firms will be used.IFC has a strong role to play since it will provide long-term lending, which is otherwise almost unavailable. Moreover, IFC will ensure that the project is implemented in an environmentally sound manner. It is anticipated that IFC will arrange technical assistance for the company in areas such as management information systems.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityThe environmental documents will be disclosed at the gates of the project site at the following address:308 Den Syo PinBishkek, Kyrgyz Republic","The project sponsor is JSC Stock Company Akun Ltd.

In July 1999, SCM was awarded a license, through competitive tender, to build and operate the second nation-wide GSM digital cellular phone network in Cameroon. Under the license agreement, SCM is required to achieve pre-determined coverage levels with its network, commencing with coverage of the country''s three major commercial centers and the interconnecting highways within the first year, and culminating in coverage of all towns with more than 50,000 inhabitants within five years. The company launched services in January 2000 and has since experienced strong demand for its services. The project represents the initial three years of the company''s investment program.The project is expected to have significant development impact by: (i) providing much needed telecommunications infrastructure; (ii) supporting the liberalization of the sector and introducing competition; (iii) lowering the entry barrier to telecommunications services; and, (iv) providing access to telephony in previously unserved areas.This would be IFCs first investment in the telecommunications sector of Cameroon. It will complement the World Bank strategy for Cameroon''s telecommunications sector by supporting private sector participation, fostering competition and, through its demonstration effect, opening the country to foreign investment. As private capital is scarce in Cameroon, IFC would fulfil an important role by helping facilitate local currency long-term financing on terms and maturities not otherwise available.

Grupo Peixoto de Castro,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Brazil,GPC PARTICIPACOES S.A,Regional Industry - MAS LAC,2001-03-19T05:00:00Z,2001-04-30T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"The proposed project consists of- For Apolo:The implementation of a new steel pipe line in replacement of an old one.- For Synteko: The implementation of a new resin plant in Uberaba, and the implementation of a three-year expansion and renovation program of its existing resin, adhesives and floor wax facilities in Araucaria, Parana State and Gravatai Rio Grande de Sul State.The proposed project will not result in resettlement or economic displacement.IFC RoleIFC has five important roles to play in this project. First, IFC''s involvement in the project will provide the necessary long-term financing for two medium-sized Brazilian companies (SMEs), which access such investment opportunity for the first time. Following the Brazilian economic crisis, long-term financing has been severely restricted to local companies, particularly for middle-market firms and SMEs. The lack of access to such financing has been a major constraint to the development of the Brazilian private sector, hampering productivity increases, broad-based growth, and a broader distribution of the benefits of growth.  Under current conditions, in both international and domestic Brazilian financial markets, only larger firms can access financing, while SMEs, such as Apolo and Synteko, are further delayed the necessary investments that will modernize them and enable to mantain international competitiveness. The only way to obtain financing, for a commercially viable and otherwise efficient mid-sized firm, is through the support of sources such as IFC.  Second, IFC would introduce the companies for the first time to international lending practices that would serve as an important step to gain visibility and credibility for access further international credit markets in the future.  Third, IFC''s involvement would support environmentally sound and socially conscious practices, with a strong demonstration effect in this important area of corporate responsibilities that is still at a nascent stage in Brazil.  Fourth, IFC''s involvement in this project would allow two local companies to improve their efficiency in order to better compete with multinational companies, especially in the consumer cleaning segment. Fifth, IFC investment in this project would contribute to the development of the related industries (MDF, particleboard and natural gas) which are experiencing significant demand and pressure to increase their production capacities.Development ImpactThis is the type of real sector company which is critical to the success of Brazil''s adjustment program. Only if these mid-size competitive producers invest to modernize and expand, will Brazil''s growth recover. This growth is critical for the benefits of the Plano Real  to begin to be felt in Brazil. The assistance provided to Apolo would improve the operating efficiency and competitiveness of a medium-sized company and would allow the increase in natural gas consumption, a cheaper and more environmentally friendly source of energy. IFC support would also help Satipel, another mid-sized IFC project with important development impact (including the substitution of hardwood consumption for the benefit of MDF), receive stable and high quality supply of resin at competitive costs. Finally, the project will contribute to a decline in prices of products which will benefit consumers especially in the low and middle income segment of the population.World Bank Group StrategyThe World Bank Group''s assistance strategy for Brazil was considered by the Board in a joint IBRD-IFC CAS on March 30, 2000.  The principal objective of the country assistance strategy (CAS) is the achievement of sustainable, private-sector led, broadly shared growth, and the priorities for achievement of such growth include: (i) creation of new employment opportunities in internationally competitive private firms; (ii) broadened finance access to the commercial system, both for starting business (i.e. bank lending, leasing, micro-finance), and for participation in their benefits (i.e. broader share ownership); and (iii) delivery of improvements in areas of basic needs and/or visible impact on standards of living: housing, water, health, education, urban transport.  IFC''s strategy, consistent with the CAS framework, has the following primary components: (i) backing companies that will create growth, particularly middle-market firms; (ii) supporting activities which demonstrate tangible benefits of liberalization; (iii) investing in financial and physical infrastructure to improve the prospects for sustained growth.  IFC''s financing of the project is consistent with this strategy as IFC''s involvement will help this middle-market companies access term-financing it could not otherwise obtain and without which it could not contribute to the supply response  that Brazil needs.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityThe ERS will be disclosed in the companies'' administrative offices in Lorena, Sao Paulo State, in Gravatai, Rio Grande De Sul State, and in Araucaria, Parana State and in the following locations:	SyntekoEscola Municipal Vespertino F.

Principal cargo types transported during 2000 included aerospace equipment, humanitarian aid, heavy industrial shipments and consumer goods. Currently, VDA operates nine Antonov An-124-100 aircraft. This is the largest freighter aircraft in the world and has unique mission capabilities, since no other aircraft can carry cargo shipments of comparable size or weight. VDA''s fleet is the largest commercial fleet of An-124-100 currently in service. The An-124-100 was developed in the Soviet Union as a heavy, long-haul military aircraft. The An-124 was first introduced in operation in 1982 and since the late 80s has been used for commercial purposes. At present, the An-124-100 is the world''s largest transportation aircraft in operation -- it is more than 50 meters long, it can carry up to 120 tons of cargo, and has a range of 5,000 kilometres with maximum payload.The proposed project is to expand VDA''s fleet by acquiring two additional An-124-100 aircraft and four D18T engines. One aircraft will be acquired through the purchase and subsequent completion of one partially built An-124-100 airframe, currently at the Aviastar-SP Joint Stock Company (Aviastar) aircraft factory in Ul''yanovsk. VDA has a sufficient number of spare engines in stock to equip this aircraft. The second aircraft will be obtained from sources such as the secondary market or by means of civil conversion of a military aircraft. Additional four engines will be needed to equip the second aircraft.The expansion of its fleet will allow VDA to strengthen its position as the leading airline in the international heavy and outsize air cargo market. The project will have a significant development impact by creating and retaining jobs for Russian nationals in the region, by generating hard currency for the country, and by catalysing the development of air transport infrastructure in Russia. VDAs activities have significant impact on the Ul''yanovsk region. VDA directly employs about 1,000 local residents and makes significant contribution to the regional budget. In addition, the survival of Aviastar, a producer of An-124 and the biggest employer in Ul''yanovsk to a large extend depends on the orders for spare parts and maintenance from VDA. VDA provides crucial contribution to the development of transport infrastructure in Russia. As one of the leaders in the industry VDA brings its vast international  experience and knowledge of modern industry practices to the country. IFC will play an essential role in this project by providing long-term financing as well as by mobilizing financing from international financial markets. VDAs ability to expand its business is impaired by the unavailability of long-term financing in Russia. The US$25 million investment by IFC will provide financial support to the company at the critical stage of its development. In addition, IFC expects to mobilize US$30 million from commercial banks, bilateral and multilateral institutions, which is particularly important given the reluctance of the foreign institutions to take Russia risk following the 1998 crisis. It will also be a first example of using Russia-built aircraft as a security for loans from international financial institutions.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognised performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityVDA Head Quarters (Administrative Office)     14, Karbysheva Street     432062 Ul''yanovsk, Russia","Approximately 24% of the joint stock company of Volga Dnepr Airlines (VDA, or the company) is owned by current and former employees of VDA.

CAESS/EEO/DEUSEM Distribution Companies,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,El Salvador,"COMPANIA DE ALUMBRADO ELECTRICO DE SAN SALVADOR, S.A. DE C.V.",Regional Industry - INF LAC,2001-03-29T05:00:00Z,2001-05-30T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"Collectively, CAESS, EEO, and  DEUSEM (the companies) provide electricity to approximately 58 percent of El Salvador. CAESS is the largest of the three systems, serving 437,000 customers in an area of 4,281 km.  EEO serves 158,000 customers in an area of 6,212 km2.  With the exception of the San Miguel area, the EEO service area is much more rural than is CAESS'', and was more affected by the conflicts that occurred in El Salvador from 1980 to 1992. DEUSEM is the smallest of the three systems, providing electricity to 41,000 customers in an area of 1,129 km2. DEUSEM principally serves residential customers in the department of Usulatan.The purpose of the project is: (a) to expand the companies'' distribution networks in order to connect new customers, which are expected to primarily be rural households; (b) to rehabilitate the companies'' existing fixed assets in order to increase reliability and reduce technical losses; (c) to improve billing, metering and internal control systems so as to increase collections and reduce non-technical losses; and (d) to provide for the companies'' working capital requirements.Investment RequirementsThe three distribution companies expect to increase their sales through expansion of their networks and through the implementation of marketing programs which, over time, will increase average consumption per customer served. The companies foresee that substantial cost reductions can be accomplished through: (i) the installation of new meters and by implementing a meter verification/calibration program on existing installations; (ii) the upgrading of customer commercial systems; and (iii) improved working capital performance to be achieved through the increased use of automated meter reading, implementation of on-site billing programs, introduction of direct debit and credit card payment options for customers and enhancement of credit and collection practices.In terms of network expansion, the companies plan to invest approximately US$59 million in their distribution networks in order to connect new customers, primarily rural households (60% of which currently lack access to electricity) and improve service for their existing customers.  It should be noted that 64% of rural Salvadoran households lacking access to electricity are located in EEO''s and DEUSEM''s service territories. To address issues of system reliability and loss reduction, the companies expect to invest approximately US$40 million. To improve service quality and efficiency, the companies contemplate investments of approximately US$5.5 million in computers and information systems.Developmental ImpactIFC''s proposed investment will enable CAESS, EEO and DEUSEM to replace antiquated distribution infrastructure, to improve service quality and to expand their networks into underserved rural areas, some of which are recovering from the recent devastating earthquakes. Expanding the grid to rural areas will be a major step forward in the socio-economic development of El Salvador, enabling increased industrial development and employment. Electricity from the grid will also replace the current use of wood as fuel for many rural domestic uses and for small-scale industries. The almost universal use of wood as a fuel in many unelectrified rural areas in El Salvador has left the country one of the most deforested countries in the western hemisphere.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityCAESS Sucursal MetrosurCentro Comercial Metrosur,Abajo del Pollo Campero,San Salvador, El SalvadorCAESS Salvador del MundoCentro Comercial Granada,Locales 14 al 17,Entre 63 y 65 Av.

Sofia Med,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,Bulgaria,SOFIA MED SA,Regional Industry - MAS ECA,2001-04-10T04:00:00Z,2001-05-15T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"The proposed project is to revamp a nearly idle and ill-maintained copper processing facility, Sofia Med, and to transform it into a modern, cost efficient plant producing 120,000 tpy of copper and copper alloy products.In December 1999, Halcor acquired the assets of the former Bulgarian copper processor, KOCM, and established a new company, Sofia Med.  At the time of the acquisition, KOCM was facing bankruptcy, it had ceased production and its creditors were selling the pledged assets.  KOCM was notoriously privatized in 1997.  The local owner did not put any money into the plant, nor made any effort to reduce production costs.  The plant''s losses continued to accumulate, and in 1999 it stopped production and was put in the hands of the court.  Halcor will refurbish the plant, inject necessary capital to restart production, and improve production methods to facilitate the transition to high value added products.  The project will be implemented in two stages over a five-year period.  The first stage will comprise mainly environmental investments (environmental clean-up of the project site, switching the main energy source from fuel oil to natural gas; replacing oil cooling with water-cooling, etc.), and investments needed to facilitate immediate commencement of the facility''s operations.  The second stage will comprise investments in the casting, extrusion, and rolling mills departments, which will allow gradual improvement in capacity utilization. The plant is currently producing small quantities of brass tubes and bars.  At project completion, the company will be manufacturing 120,000 tpy of copper and brass products, which will be marketed by Halcor, primarily to existing customers through its various global distribution outlets.IFC Role	This project is an example of an established Greek company seeking IFC''s help in pursuing pioneering investments in riskier operating environments. Though Halcor has an established market position globally, this would be its first overseas manufacturing investment.  IFC''s presence therefore is vital to mitigate some of the risks that Halcor would face in a different regulatory environment.  IFC is playing an important role in : (i) structuring the financial plan; (ii) prioritizing important environmental investments; and (iii) helping to revive and sustain a major productive asset and a key employer in the region.  IFC would also help the company obtain adequate long term financing at reasonable terms, which is not otherwise available.  IFC also expects to do a possible co-financing with Greek banks, thereby serving as an important catalyst in the transaction. Developmental ImpactThe proposed project will have a significant developmental impact:(i) Positive environmental impact:  This will include switching to energy efficient and environmentally friendly energy sources; implementing significantly better employee health and safety practices, compared to past and present practices in Bulgaria.  IFC''s participation and expertise will contribute to the implementation of an investment program which meets all World Bank, EU, and Bulgarian environmental standards.  (ii) Demonstration effect:  In view of the perceived macroeconomic and political risks involved in investing in Bulgaria, IFC''s participation, along with the proposed co-financing from Greek banks, and presence of Halcor and Union Miniere (important and well reputed players in the field of metal processing and distribution) will have a significant demonstration effect in supporting foreign direct investment in Bulgaria''s manufacturing sector.  (iii) Know-how transfer:  The project will benefit from the know-how and management expertise of a strong sponsor, who has significant technological know-how in investment and production of copper and copper alloy processing.  Also, the sponsor will bring into the project advanced marketing and sales techniques and a proven quality control system.(iv) Improved skills base:  An important part of the sponsors'' support will be on job training, which will be provided by Halcor. (v) Increased employment:  The project will create new employment in Bulgaria, both directly and indirectly, having an important impact in a period of high unemployment in the country.  Currently there are 200 employees in the plant, and Halcor expects to increase direct employment to about 500 people within a six-year period.  Additional employment is expected to be generated in the supply stream and in ancillary activities.  In addition, temporary employment will be provided to local labor during the construction phase.(vi) Supporting sustainable industries producing higher value added products: The project would help the Bulgarian government support sustainable industries with strong sponsors, producing higher value added products. Over the long term, the project is expected to serve as a model for further private-sector development by:  (1) providing a clear example of the application of modern management and corporate governance in Bulgaria; (2) attracting a sponsor with first-class expertise; and (3) promoting the development of a key industry for the Bulgarian economy through a strategic alliance with a well established player in the extremely competitive metal alloy processing industry.World Bank Group strategyThe project fits well with the World Bank Group strategy for fostering sustainable economic growth by accelerating structural reform and rapid development of the private sector.  IFC supports Bulgaria''s privatization efforts by focusing on financing recently privatized enterprises, and by supporting manufacturing opportunities in various sectors, which have strategic importance for Bulgaria.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project, according to IFCs environmental review procedure because a limited number of specific environmental impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

Today, Puerto Aguirre is an inland river port facility with diversified terminals (grain port, general cargo, vegetable oil and diesel terminal). The port installations also have loading and unloading platforms for trucks and railcars, specialized piers (grains, vegetable oil, and fuel), warehouses, silos, weighing scales, etc. In general, CAPSA has modern and versatile installations for the efficient handling of loose general cargo, solid bulk commodities (grains, meals), bagged products, and liquids (vegetable oil and diesel fuel). Puerto Aguirre is the first port and grain terminal in Bolivia and facilitated the opening up a landlocked nation by providing an attractive outlet to the Atlantic Ocean through the Paraguay-Parana river system. IFC helped the company in its initial stages of development by providing financing for the initial expansion of the terminal and its facilities. As the first grain terminal in Bolivia, Puerto Aguirre served as a catalyst in the successful implementation of the World Bank''s ""Eastern Lowlands"" agricultural production development project and has since attracted other grain facilities to start operation in the area. The proposed project includes: (i) extension of the facilities of the free zone to allow more storage space; (ii) expansion of the bulk terminal for handling soy products and general cargo (pro rata portion on investment in the joint venture with Cargill); and, (iii) expansion of the diesel fuel terminal by constructing two additional storage tanks and improvement of existing facilities (pro rata portion of investment in the joint venture with the Williams Companies). In addition, the existing debt of the company, including bridge loans for the expansion project (about US$700,000), will also be refinanced to lengthen the maturity of debt so that a higher portion of internally generated cash can be invested into the proposed capital expenditures. The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2003.IFC''s continued support for this project will encourage further competition in the area as well as lower the cost of transportation in the region by providing efficient cargo handling services. In addition, IFC''s investment in the venture will provide comfort to other multilateral banks to provide additional financing for the project and any future financing needs of the company. CAPSA is currently financing its expansion with short-term loans at a high interest rate. In this context, IFC will bring financing at a tenor and interest rate that are essential for this project but not available from other sources. IFC''s involvement in the proposed project will also assure that the development will not have adverse effects on the environment, surrounding urban areas, and access routes.Puerto Aguirre is a pioneering private sector initiative in the infrastructure development in Bolivia. It provided Bolivia with its first operational outlet to the sea via the Paraguay-Parana waterway, which triggered Bolivia''s growth of agro-products. In the last ten years, the country has evolved into the seventh largest producer of soybeans in the world. Puerto Aguirre''s expansion will serve to increase growing trade by providing Bolivian importers and exporters with better access to foreign markets at reduced costs. The development of the port and the free zone has increased agricultural and trading activity in the region and has created more job opportunities and improved the economic well being of the people in this region. This improvement is expected to continue and the growing agriculture and trade is likely to increase employment opportunities in this relatively poor region of Bolivia.  Furthermore, the expansion of the free zone will help the facility become an additional tourist attraction for the growing number of Brazilian tourists that visit the ecological reserve of Pantanal.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected community1.

IFC would invest less of US$20 million or 25% of the Fund.  A first closing of the fund may occur at US$50 million.  The Brazilian Corporate Governance Fund will be a closed-end fund with an expected life of six years.  Its objective is to create value for investors by identifying, investing in, and supporting mid-sized Brazilian companies committed to implementing the highest international standards of corporate governance, and which are also undervalued at current stock prices.  IFC''s roleIFC will send a clear signal of support to the Brazilian authorities and to a broad set of private sector actors who are pushing for changes to the legal and regulatory framework for corporate governance.  In addition, IFC has a strong role to play by helping the sponsors structure the Fund.  Most importantly, as a vocal proponent of improved corporate governance values in emerging markets, IFC''s presence as an investor in the Fund, and as a member of its investment committee and advisory board, will also be crucial to attract other investors both in Brazil and abroad.Developmental ImpactEmpirical evidence across countries indicates that more developed and more active capital markets are associated with higher rates of economic growth and that well-balanced financial systems with financial intermediation by both banks and capital markets can also absorb shocks better.  Efficient capital markets enhance resource allocation, raise long-term financing for investment, and provide diverse financing opportunities for firms both directly and indirectly, by offering exit vehicles for venture capitalists.  Addressing the corporate governance problem in Brazil is essential to develop the countrys capital markets and will depend, among other factors, on enhancing minority rights protection, strengthening the corporate governance of institutional investors, and expanding the structure and enforcement of regulation and supervision.  If achieved, these improvements would result in higher firm valuation, lower cost of capital, and less profitable investment opportunities being bypassed.","","","","","","","","","","","This fund falls somewhere between a private equity fund and listed equities fund.

The funds will be mainly used for real-estate based financing, including acquiring, constructing or upgrading both commercial and residential property, and financing SMEs. The IFC loan would be accompanied by a program of specialized technical assistance  to assist the Bank with appraising, processing and supervising mortgage loans; administering the IFC funds; and developing and strengthening TBC''s policies relating to mortgage loans. It is also envisaged that the TA team could undertake more general activities such as training credit officers on real estate appraisal.  IFC RoleIFC''s roles in this project are:(a)	Providing term funding which will help TBC diversify its funding base, and allow it to offer longer-term loans for inherently long-term assets.  There are no other long term sources of funding at present in Georgia - there is no bond market and foreign private banks are not prepared to provide the country with long term funding.(b)	Developing valuation and mortgage lending expertise.  The technical assistance team will help IFC TBC Bank to develop its real estate lending program through development, review and validation of the bank''s underwriting criteria.  (c)	Stimulating competition.  TBC will become the second Georgian bank to offer residential mortgage loans, thus giving consumers a choice and encouraging improvements in price and quality of service by all participants.  It is notable that in the past two years the interest rate and service quality for SME borrowers has improved as competition in the Georgian banking sector has increased.Development ImpactThe IFC mortgage/SME credit line is expected to have an impact on: (a)	the financial sector:  the IFC loan and technical assistance package will stimulate competition in the nascent residential mortgage market in Georgia. The development of real estate finance will also gradually stimulate demand for other financial services including escrow services, life and hazard insurance, and, potentially in the long term, a bond market through the issuance of mortgage backed securities.  In addition, the credit line will continue to support the competition which has emerged among Georgian banks during the past two years to provide good quality and appropriately priced banking services to SMEs.(b)	TBC Bank: IFCs loan and technical assistance will allow TBC Bank to gain expertise within mortgage lending, expand its successful SME lending, diversify its portfolio and continue to develop best practices in underwriting criteria; and (c)	private Georgian enterprises and individuals:  Small business will benefit from the availability of long term funding.  Individual home ownership will contribute to cementing the notion of private property among the Georgian public and will improve the quality of life for families.

More importantly, IFC will be supporting a microfinance institution whose main sponsor, Fininvest, is willing to approach microfinance as a sustainable business. Should this approach succeed in Brazil, others will certainly replicate it. Sustainable microfinance institutions, in turn, would bring to a different plateau the access to credit for a large number of microenterprises, which are an important engine of economic growth and social development in most emerging markets including Brazil.

In 1951, ABN (Algemene Bank Nederland) Amro bought a third of the banks shares which were in turn sold to Deutsche Bank in 1978. During the financial turmoil of the early 1980s, BM benefited from the strong support of Deutsche Bank who ended up acquiring full control of the institution. The Velox group bought in 1992 a 35% interest in BM. A year later it assumed responsibility for the management of the institution and in 1997 it ended up owning 99% of the bank''s shares. BM has more than 1,600 corporate customers, 40% of which are small and medium-sized companies (SMEs). Most of the credit lines offered by the bank are for one-year term or less. The bank offers a broad range of retail banking products to approximately 34,000 individuals. The purpose of the IFC investment is to fund Banco Montevideo''s expansion strategy through the acquisition of Banco Caja Obrera, currently being privatized by the Central Bank. Through this investment, IFC will assist in the revitalization of the Uruguayan banking sector by enhancing the competitive capabilities of one of the most active banks in the country. It will also support a greater role for the private banking sector, in a market still crowded out by the public sector, and it will service the largely overlooked consumer and SME segments. The IFC venture will also improve service to the retail market, currently disregarded by the banking sector, by enabling Banco Montevideo to acquire a privatized bank with a portfolio concentrated in this segment. Currently, in the retail segment, only 35% of the Uruguayan population has access to bank credits. Existing retail financing takes place mainly through retailers and credit cards at very high interest rates. The proposed investment will give Uruguayan lower-middle and middle-segments of the population greater access to bank credit. Financial support of Banco Montevideo''s acquisition might result in a demonstration effect that could pave the way for more commercial lending to these segments.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Financial Intermediary Type 1 project.

Niger Delta Contractor Revolving Credit Facility,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Africa,Nigeria,Niger Delta Contractor Revolving Credit Facility,Regional Industry - INF Africa,2001-04-23T04:00:00Z,2001-05-24T04:00:00Z,FI,Loan,"This project involves the establishment of a US$30 million revolving credit facility by IFC, Shell and a local bank. The facility, details of which are still under discussion, would focus on the oil services sector in Nigeria and would provide competitively priced term funding to small and medium-sized local contractors delivering services to the Shell Petroleum Development Company Joint Venture of Nigeria Limited (SPDC JV), primarily in the Niger Delta.  Currently, access to term funding is essentially nonexistent for these contractors.  Available credit to these companies is only short-term and very expensive.  Local banks lack adequate term finance resources in both Naira and US dollars, and tend to limit their exposure to Niger Delta contractors, because they portray high risks.  In addition, interest rates charged to these contractors are usually indexed to the Nigerian Inter-Bank Offered Rate (NIBOR), which is highly volatile.  Under these conditions, it is difficult for them to acquire and finance equipment, which in turn prohibits them from competing for larger, higher value-added contracts.  One of the major developmental benefits of the project would be its positive effect on the Niger Delta.  The facility would help support the growth of targeted local contractors, and, as a result, make a contribution to relieve unemployment and poverty.  Funding under the facility would also lead to technology transfer and more skilled training, which would provide longer term development gains and movement up the value chain.  This would also enable local contractors to compete more effectively with foreign companies on certain contracts, which are not currently accessible to them.  Ultimately the project would establish a strong base of local service companies, which would produce all around benefits, such as lowering the country''s production costs and increasing the benefits of oil production to the economy in general.The proposed facility would be the first of its kind for IFC.  IFC is actively involved with Shell in working out the structuring and funding arrangements.  The facility will also involve a local bank, which is yet to be identified.  By financing one third of the required funding for the facility, IFC will play a catalytic role in mobilizing additional term funding, which is not readily available to small oil services contractors operating in the Niger Delta.  The facility would also enable targeted contractors to access less expensive US dollar financing and strengthen their financial condition by reducing their borrowing costs.  In parallel, IFC''s SME department and APDF are actively working with SPDC JV to put together an estimated US$210,000 capacity building program to support contractors in developing their business.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Financial Intermediary (FI) Type 2 project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedure.

The investment will also support new product development with new designs and features in response to export market demands and specifications.  The project is expected to be completed by end-2002.Development Impact:  The proposed project will have a significant direct and indirect development impact on the local economy, especially since Gunkol sources products from over 300 local suppliers, mostly in the Izmir area.  While direct additional employment at Gunkol will be limited to about 40 people, the project will generate significant indirect employment for about 200 people at local suppliers who are expected to provide higher local value-added and technical inputs to Gunkol.  The gradual transformation of Gunkol into a leading global supplier through newer production and design technologies will help the Company and the local suppliers to become globally competitive through increased quality and efficiency demands of export markets.  Gunkol could also serve as a model for other Turkish manufacturing enterprises aiming to become competitive exporters to help the economy.  IFC Role:  The project gives IFC an opportunity to support a new client in Turkey, which is a growing medium-size, second-tier, export-oriented, family-owned company not associated with any of the large industrial groups in Turkey.  Access to long-term financing in Turkey is limited, especially for second-tier companies such as Gunkol.  IFC will provide a stable longer-term funding base to the Company so that it can instead focus strategically on enhancing production efficiency and exports.  This will directly support the Turkish economy, especially in the current economic climate.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityThe Company will disclose the documents locally as appropriate in accordance with IFC''s public disclosure guidelines, including at the following address:Gunes Enerjisi ve Klima Sanayi A.S.Fevzi Cakmak MahBekir Saydam cd.

Central CHP plants, such as those operated by PPIC, are more efficient and thus generate steam using much less fuel.  This enables the shutdown of many of these small boilers, thus reducing regional air emissions (including greenhouse gases) as well as generating substantial cost savings.  Unfortunately, Government of PRC environmental regulations are inadequately enforced, and even relatively new CHP plants are non-compliant and sub-optimally managed.  The project will have a strong development impact by demonstrating that environmentally compliant, well-managed CHP plants can be financially viable in the PRC market, thus setting a benchmark for other operators.  IFCs involvement will ensure that existing plants are environmentally upgraded to the extent practical and that new units meet international emissions levels.The World Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy for China calls on IFC to assist China in establishing a more private sector-oriented framework for infrastructure development.  Another major objective of the WBGs work in China is to assist State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in becoming more competitive.  In an indirect way, this project does that by providing lower priced steam inputs to industrial SOEs.  In addition, the WBGs strategy for China specifically cites the need to assist the country in reducing the level of air pollution.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityPeak Pacific Investment CompanyBeijing Reperesentative Office9th Floor Sunjoy Mansion6 Ritan RoadChaoyang DistrictBejing, China  100020","Peak Pacific Investment Corporation Ltd (PPIC)The management of PPIC is focused on the power market, and specifically within that broad market, the market for combined heat and power plants (CHP) in China.  This has allowed PPIC to develop standard processes in appraising, investing in and operating CHP plants.  Standardization has facilitated the comparison of the risk-return profile among PPICs projects.  PPIC management concentrates also on lowering overhead costs by hiring locally and extensively training staff so that, over time, decisions can be pushed down to the local level.  Management believes that it has developed among its staff some of the most knowledgeable experts in the CHP business in China.PPICs majority owner is Alliant Energy International, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alliant Energy Corporation, an electric utility based in the Midwestern U.S. within excess of US$6 billion in assets (as of 12/31/00) and net income in 2000 of just under US$400 million.  Alliant is expanding its activities in distribution and CHP, where it has extensive US experience.  PPIC strongly benefits from the active participation of Alliant.  Alliant provides support during due diligence and actively monitors the Companys activities at the Board level.  Alliant has indicated that PPIC will be its primary vehicle for investing in CHP projects in China.  It is also active in two other international markets  Australia/New Zealand and Brazil.  Other key investors in the Company are the John Hancock Insurance Company and the Energy Investors Fund Group. The existing owners of PPIC, with their respective ownership percentages, are Alliant Energy International (82.3%), John Hancock Life Insurance Co.

PPIC was established in 1996 to own and manage the operation of electric and steam generating facilities in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). These facilities are primarily combined heat and power plants (CHP) that provide electricity to a local grid and steam to industry and heat to residential customers. The company has also begun to look at investing in plants that sell electricity (as well as in some situations, steam) to a single customer (captive"").  PPIC is registered and has its headquarters in Singapore, with technical and administrative staff based in Beijing.  Alliant Energy International, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alliant Energy Corporation (a Midwest US power utility), is the majority shareholder in PPIC.The PRC continues to be forecasted as the largest growth market for electric power generation in the world over the next 10 years.  The CHP market in China continues to be favored by all PRC policymakers.  CHP plants will continue to be needed, as they are the only method of providing small towns and cities in China with central heating/process steam for factories in a clean and efficient manner. More recently, captive plants have begun to be offered for sale to investors by a number of Chinese companies as the need to become cost competitive and focus on core business interests has been heightened with the advent of Chinas entry into the WTO.The Company has focused its development efforts in areas where there is a need for locally produced power, and in economically advanced cities and towns where process steam can be used by financially viable industries.  A typical investment profile of a PPIC project is a combined heat and power/cogeneration plant or a captive power facility that sells power and/or steam to one/two customers.  Electrical capacity is typically 25 to 100 MW.  PPIC will consider investing either via acquisition or expansion of an existing plant or construction of a new facility.  Funds are invested through a 60 to 80 percent ownership of a joint venture using a Cooperative Joint Venture (CJV) structure with the local municipal government or large end user as the normal joint venture partner.  PPIC controls the CJV''s in which they have invested to date and has stated clearly that such control is a key requirement for future PPIC investments.  Project prerequisites are that the local community and government should fully support the project, there should be a strong and expanding market for heat/steam, and power and steam tariffs should be competitive with the market. PPIC works actively with Chinese banks to raise local RMB financing for its projects whenever possible.  The Company has been able to hedge its foreign currency exposures in projects that have foreign currency debt.PPIC started construction on its first plant, a 24 MW CHP plant in Hebei Province, in October 1998 and it commenced operation in October 2000.  The Company''s second project, acquired in April 1999, was a 6 MW CHP plant in Shandong Province.  The acquisition of a 2 x 50 MW power plant in Henan Province followed in October 1999.  An additional 24 MW CHP plant was acquired in Hebei in 2000.  All plants use local coal as fuel.  The Company plans to have one additional project in place by the end of June 2001, and to develop two to three projects per year thereafter.  PPIC has been able to develop projects with competitive power and steam tariffs (e.g. power tariffs in PPIC projects range from 3.7 UScents/kwh to 4.5 UScents/kwh).  PPIC''s projects have long-term power and steam offtake contracts with cost pass-through provisions.Alliant Energy has already funded/committed to provide USD 85 million in equity investment.  IFC has been invited to consider an equity investment in and a convertible loan to the Company. PPIC views IFCs support at this juncture in its development as important in realizing its strategic objectives.","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityPeak Pacific Investment CompanyBeijing Reperesentative Office9th Floor Sunjoy Mansion6 Ritan RoadChaoyang DistrictBejing, China  100020","","","","",10774,"",AA - Coal - Thermal Power Generation,"","","",""

The Company began operation in June 1999 with a focus on penetrating the Kenyan wholesale market. The project is to build a fuel oil terminal and blending unit at the port of Mombasa. The project will enable Gapco Kenya to import larger parcels, store in-house, lower costs, provide tailored products, improve reliability of supply and grow its fuel distribution business.    The  project will have a strong developmental impact as it supports the expansion of the oil distribution sector and improves the availability of fuel oil in East Africa. All oil is imported in East Africa and the project increases and improves the infrastructure for handling oil products, the lifeblood for any developing economy.  The project is a natural backward linkage to the IPPs supported by the World Bank Group in Kenya. Kenya over the past three years faced an acute power deficit due to a lack of investment in power generation and a drought that reduced hydro supply. The WB group has encouraged the Kenyan government to allow independent suppliers to generate power to reduce the deficit. These IPPs all use fuel oil to generate electricity. With the revival of the East African Community and the goal of creating a regional market and trading block,  there will be a demonstration effect as Gapco is one of the first local companies that is adopting a regional rather than national strategy. The project will provide Gapco Kenya the infrastructure facilities to compete more effectively with the multinationals, leading to better service and lower fuel costs for consumers.

ICME ECAB,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,Romania,ICME ECAB SA,Regional Industry - MAS ECA,2001-05-15T04:00:00Z,2001-06-15T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"The proposed project is to revamp a cable manufacturing plant, ICME ECAB S.A. (ICME or the project), located in Bucharest, Romania, and to transform it into a cost efficient facility producing a wide range of high quality cables, conductors, and wires. The total project cost is estimated at about Euro 40.1million.  At Project completion, ICMEs nominal capacity will be about 70,000 tpy.  The project will be implemented by Hellenic Cables S.A., the leading cable and conductor manufacturer in Greece with more than 50 years industry experience.  As part of the project, Hellenic Cables will refurbish the plant, improve production methods, and facilitate the transition to higher value-added products.  After the completion of the investment program, ICME will have: i) the ability to produce a wide range of high value-added products; ii) the required flexibility to adapt to changing local and international markets; and iii) the capacity to meet expected demand growth from new infrastructure projects in Romania and neighboring countries. BackgroundThe Austrian Industrial Group, ISOVOLTA, a world leader in the insulating products market acquired the state-owned ICME S.A, (ICME ECAB''s predecessor), in  April 1998.  In April 1999, ICME S.A. was split into two companies, ICME ECAB, manufacturing cables, and ICME ELECTROIZOLANTE, manufacturing insulating materials.  Hellenic Cables S.A., Greece, acquired 94% of ICME ECAB in 1999, from ISOVOLTA, Austria, and from other smaller shareholders, including SIF Oltenia, one of the largest Romanian Investment funds with equity holdings in over 400 companies.  The transaction was done through the Romanian Stock Exchange as ICME ECAB was listed on the Romanian O-T-C market.  Currently, Hellenic Cables owns 81% of ICME ECAB''s shares, the Danube Fund, Greece, owns about 14%, and the balance of about 5% are floating shares.IFC Role	Investment in cable production is often seen as a precursor for investment in important telecom and power infrastructure.  Therefore, with the increased demand for improving communication and power networks in Romania, Hellenic Cables sees a market opportunity for expansion of its original small cable investment.   As this would be one of the first overseas manufacturing investments for the established Greek company, it is seeking IFC''s help in expanding in riskier operating environments.   IFC''s presence therefore is important in mitigating some of the risks that Hellenic Cables would face in Romania.  IFC is also playing an important role in structuring the financial plan and in bringing in another lender into the transaction while also helping to sustain a major productive asset and a key employer in the region.  This is particularly important for Romania as foreign direct investment (FDI) continues to be low and any efforts to increase investor interest by institutions, such as IFC, are well appreciated by the government, and are an intrinsic part of IFC''s strategy.   Developmental ImpactThe proposed project will have significant developmental impacts:(i) Demonstration effect:  In view of the perceived macroeconomic and political risks to investing in Romania, IFC''s participation, along with Viohalco, a well reputed player in the field of metal processing and distribution, will have a significant demonstration effect in supporting foreign direct investment in Romania''s manufacturing sector.  FDI, an essential factor for sustainable economic growth, has been low in Romania, and has started falling back sharply after reaching a peak in 1998.(ii) Know-how transfer:  The project will benefit from the management expertise of a strong sponsor, who has significant technological know-how in cable, conductor and wire manufacturing for both investment and production. Also, the sponsor will bring into the project advanced marketing and sales techniques and a proven quality control system.(iii) Positive environmental impact:  The proposed project will have a positive environmental impact. This will include installation of new collecting, recycling, and recirculating systems; implementation of significantly better employee health and safety practices, compared to past and present practices in Romania.  IFC''s participation and expertise will contribute to the realization of an investment program which meets all World Bank, EU, and Romanian environmental standards.  (iv) Improved skills base:  An important part of the sponsors'' support will be on-the job training provided by Hellenic Cables, including employee training in Hellenic Cables or Telecables plants in Greece. (v) Increased employment:  The project will create employment in Romania, both directly and indirectly, an important impact in a period of high unemployment in the country.  The modernization of the factory will create openings for professionals, as well as for highly skilled workers.  Additional employment is expected to be generated in the supply stream and in ancillary activities.  In addition, temporary employment will be provided to local labor during the refurbishment phase.(vi) Supporting sustainable industries producing higher value added products: The project would help the Romanian government support sustainable industries with strong sponsors, producing higher value added products. The project is a model case of regional investment expansion,  which is very critical for improving the stability of the region by strengthening the cross border cooperation and regional economic growth.  Over the long term, the project is expected to serve as a model for further private-sector development by:  (1) providing a clear example of the application of modern management and corporate governance in Romania; (2) attracting a sponsor with first-class expertise; and (3) promoting the development of a key industry for the Romanian economy.World Bank Group StrategyThe World Bank Group lending and advisory services are aligned with the priorities of the Romanian government to promote growth through reform and private sector development.  The proposed project fits well with the World Bank Group strategy of promoting private sector development by supporting Romania''s privatization efforts.  It is part of IFC''s effort to finance recently privatized enterprises and support investment opportunities in manufacturing and various sectors  where Romania has a comparative advantage.  In addition, this project is in line with IFCs strategy to facilitate and promote foreign investment flows and increase investor confidence in the country.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityThe Environmental Review Summary (ERS) will be posted in the notice board at the entrance of ICME: 42 Drumul intre Tarlale Str.

The company started operations in 1975 and in the past four years has modernized its operations and significantly increased its exports.  The company would like to obtain IFC financing to fund: (i) an expansion in its production capacity; (ii) the continuation of the implementation of modern technology to their production processes; and (iii) the refinancing of short term debt. The project will increase their production capacity by approximately 50% from around 15,000 to around 23,000 tpa.  This will be very beneficial for operating costs, as the project will enjoy economies of scale, and production campaigns will be longer and more cost-effective.  More importantly, Tecnofil will switch completely to a modern ''continuous casting'' technology thereby increasing the company''s efficiency.Tecnofil needs the new technology to continue their modernization and maintain their growth pace, be able to compete internationally and comply with more demanding quality requirements from more sophisticated clients.IFC will play an important role in this project by:-Providing access to long term funds: The current political crisis has affected the Peruvian economy and to a large extent its financial sector.  Given the characteristics of the project and the fact that high capital investments are inherent to the industry, the project requires long term funding currently unavailable in the local market.-Increasing the companys financial viability: As a result of the project, the company will be able to access new markets, compete internationally with multinational enterprises and increase profitability.With the support from its sponsors and proactive management skills, the company has been able to turnaround its operation and financial viability including the establishment of long term contracts that assure higher sales.  However, the inability to obtain adequate financing has prevented them from undertaking the proposed expansion and has increased the threat of losing the position they have built up in their markets, something that can be resolved with an investment by the IFC.Development Impact:-IFC''s investment will create a ""demonstration effect"" to highlight attractive investment opportunities that will foster growth in Peru.-Tecnofils exports will provide the country valuable access to foreign exchange.

The project covers both the development progress to date and the next phase comprising the maintenance to maturity of immature plantations, planting of the remaining 2,700 ha of land and the construction of a second palm oil mill.  The project is the Wings expansion into agribusiness as a strategic investment that will offer synergy with its existing business and capitalize on Indonesia''s optimal conditions for oil palm cultivation.

As of April 2001, XAC  serves about 4,000 clients, and has an outstanding portfolio of about US$1.0 million equivalent.  Since commencing operation, XAC has maintained a very high portfolio quality, reached operational profitability, and built a solid reputation in Mongolia. XAC''s total assets are currently about US$ 1.5 million equivalent. Total equity is about US$ 338,000 equivalent, with UNDP funding of about US$ 720,000 equivalent (booked as liabilities) to be converted into equity over the next year. Starting in 2000, IFC obtained technical assistance funding from the Dutch government to hire microfinance consultants. The program is still ongoing.  XAC has approached other potential technical and financial partners, and has secured the involvement of the government of Finland, CGAP, Triodos Bank, and Shorebank, and other entities.Through the proposed investment, IFC will contribute to the development of XAC into a commercially-sustainable microfinance institution, with the possibility to expand into a microfinance bank.  IFC will provide additional financing to expand XAC''s lending operations.  IFC would furnish ongoing advice to XAC management in developing its strategy and business plan both through informal IFC staff involvement, and through additional technical support for which IFC is currently seeking funding.The project provides several development benefits, including increasing the availability of credit to the informal and SME sector and facilitating rural development.  In Mongolia, the informal sector (including microenterprise businesses and agricultural activity) plays a significant role in the economy, potentially accounting for over 30% of GNP according to a 1998 World Bank study. However, there is little formal financing available to the sector and many areas of the country have limited access to credit or savings.  XAC is one of a very limited number of finanical institutions to serve the microfinance sector, although competition is increasing.  The extension of XAC''s branch network into rural locations will provide important financial services and in turn contribute to rural development.  The success of XAC will promote the development of the a commercially sustainable microfinance industry.Part of IFC''s role in the project is as a lender, since long-term finance for XAC''s expansion is not available in the domestic market.  IFC will also be a provider of technical assistance, which it plans to provide in coordination with CGAP and the World Bank SME group.  IFC has also worked with the other stakeholders in the project (Triodos, Shorebank) on previous microfinance initiatives.  IFC will ensure that XAC adopts an appropriate environmental plan.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a category FI Type 1 microfinance project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.

(XAC or the company), Mongolia''s first microcredit company facility.  XAC was established as an non governamental organization (NGO) by UNDP in 1998, and was converted into Mongolia''s first non-bank financial institution (NBFI) in October 1999.  The objective of the company is to expand their microfinance operations, improve operational efficiency and eventually to convert into a microfinance bank.The company is currently owned by six local NGO shareholders which hold equal 16.7% shares.  The share capital is USD$ 218,000 equivalent (240 million Mongolian tugriks-MNT) and was provided by UNDP as grants to the shareholders.  UNDP has subsequently injected additional funds of US$ 720,000 equivalent (MNT 780 million) into the company.  During 2001, UNDP expects to convert a portion of these monies (currently booked as debt) into equity on behalf of the existing NGOs and an employee ownership fund.  The company will remain majority Mongolian owned.In the future XAC is likely to bring in international socially-oriented banks as minority shareholders, including Triodos Bank of the Netherlands and Shorebank of the US.  Triodos has disbursed a local currency loan equivalent to US$ 400,000, which is expected to be converted into an approximately 20% equity share upon XAC''s conversion to a bank.  Shorebank may become a future shareholder of about 20%.  These parties are also considering providing directors to XAC under agency agreements prior to the company''s conversion to a bank.  Soros Open Society Institute of New York is also considering an equity investment.","The total project cost is estimated to be about US$ 2.6 million, representing XAC''s existing assets of about US$ 1.5 million equivalent and funding to support XAC''s future portfolio growth through 2003.  It is likely that by 2003, XAC would be positioned to apply for a banking license under Mongolian law, which requires equity of US$ 1.9 million equivalent (MNT 2.0 billion).  The proposed IFC investment is a US$ 400,000 A loan for IFC''s account.

Ecomex is the only supplier of CNG for vehicle use in the v lley of Mexico. The company currently runs two CNG dispensing stations and a workshop offering services for the conversion of vehicles from gasoline to CNG. At the end of year 2000, Ecomex sales amounted to US$2.9 million.Ecomex has, to date, converted more than 600 microbuses, and its long-term strategy is to average 2,400 conversions per year by expanding and further developing its target market to include taxis, buses, and official vehicles. In line with this strategy, the company has embarked on a US$ 27.8 million project to (i) construct and operate 5 CNG dispensing stations in the metropolitan area of Mexico City (two of them are already in operation); (ii) operate one conversion workshop (already in operation); and (iii) provide working capital to finance the conversion of microbuses (the initial target market).The project concept relates to the use of CNG as an alternative fuel for vehicles in the highly polluted Mexico City, therefore generating important environmental benefits. Mexican authorities have been showing support to the use of CNG by (i) acquiring 480 garbage collection trucks that use CNG, and acquiring and converting 750 police patrol cars and other official vehicles to CNG; (ii) granting a waiver to converted vehicles from the ""hoy no circula"" restriction that forces vehicles to stay off the road one working day a week; (iii) extending by three years the useful life of converted microbuses; and (iv) conceding fiscal incentives for conversions.IFC RoleLong-term financing. Access to long-term financing has been a difficult challenge for Ecomex. The project''s size and need for long maturities preclude it from obtaining the required financing from local sources. The fact that the alternative fuel industry (in particular CNG) is still incipient in Mexico further hampers Ecomexs ability to raise long-term financing. Adequate long-term tenors are of critical importance given the working capital needs related to conversions. This will help the company migrate from its current development stage to a commercially viable one.Ecologically responsible enterprise. The use of CNG as an alternative fuel to gasoline/diesel is in line with the Mexican authorities'' program for a better air quality in Mexico City. IFC''s involvement could have an important demonstration effect.Replication.  The proposed investment in Ecomex will have a strong demonstration impact. Ecomex''s success should attract other companies and lenders to the market. It can also provide a model for other countries in the LAC region to promote switching to a more environment friendly fuel. Development ImpactThe project will provide a strong positive developmental impact by helping to reduce air pollution levels in Mexico City. CNG is a lead-free fuel and emits far less pollutants than gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles. In the particular case of microbuses, given their poor engine conditions, which contribute heavily to air pollution in the city, the environmental benefits of CNG are even greater.The gaseous and particulate emissions of gasoline vehicles affect the quality of the environment, particularly the health of humans on a global and local basis (especially near the surface of the earth where they are generated). CNG vehicles represent a clean alternative, which lead to significant emission reductions. The metropolitan area of Mexico City is one of the world''s largest urban areas and one of the most notorious for its high and increasing levels of air pollution. It is estimated that intensive use vehicles produce at least 35% of the vehicle-derived air pollution in Mexico City. Ecomex conversion to CNG includes the use of a catalytic converter, which is required to comply with stringent emission standards.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityFulton No. 5A in Tlalnepantla, State of Mexico;Av. 16 de Septiembre NoA. 255, Naucalpan de Juarez, State of Mexico; and Cecilio Robelo, No. 103, Delegacion Venustiano Carranza, Federal District","Combustibles Ecologicos Mexicanos (Ecomex or the company) was founded in 1997 under the laws of Mexico to operate in the compressed natural gas (CNG) engine conversion and dispensing station businesses in the metropolitan area of Mexico City (Federal District and adjacent suburbs in the state of Mexico).Two shareholders control 100% of Ecomex.

IFC has worked closely with the shareholder group to develop this transaction, including negotiating project structure, developing MFB''s business plan and operating guidelines and obtaining support for technical assistance.  When fully-operational, Micro Finance Bank Yugoslavia will provide a full range of credit and banking services to the MSE target group, including working capital and fixed asset investment lending, savings and time deposits, credit cards and money transfer services.  Foreign markets for MFB''s international transfers and payment services include the over 800,000 Yugoslav nationals resident in Germany. Bank intermediation to MSEs is close to nonexistent in Yugoslavia. Confidence in the country''s banking system was destroyed through wartime confiscation of savings accounts and the collapse of pyramid savings schemes during the early 1990s.  About half of Yugoslavias money supply is estimated to be held outside the banking system.  In common with the other parts of the former Yugoslavia there is an immediate need to build new, professionally-managed and credible banks which can be trusted as both lenders and deposit-taking institutions.The proposed investment in MFB is, therefore, expected to be strongly developmental -- in terms of its economic impacts, stimulus for business reconstruction, employment generation, confidence-building in the banking sector, and introduction of commercially-oriented microfinance techniques to Yugoslavia.In addition to poverty alleviation and related impacts within the MSE target group, IFC''s involvement in MFB is expected to yield a number of important demonstration effects.  First, establishment of MFB will provide for a best-practice financial institution with sound operating policies, transparent financial reporting, environmental screening procedures and a clear governance structure.  Establishment of a professionally-managed, reputable bank in Yugoslavia is particularly important in view of public loss of confidence in the country''s banking system as a result of wartime savings account seizures and the pyramid schemes of the 1990s.  Second, IFCs involvement in MFB is expected, over time, to lead to the replication of commercially-oriented MFIs in the market and downscaling by Yugoslavia''s existing commercial bank operations to serve MSEs.  Third,  Technical Assistance provided to MFB is expected to generate spill-over benefits in the form of trained managers and employees available to other Yugoslav financial institutions.  Lastly, MFB will contribute to mobilizing MSE savings in due course, although this will not be its initial focus.","","","","","","","","","","","MFB is a category FI Type 1 project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedure.

It is one of the few banks in Croatia which has a countrywide branch network.  IFC''s  loan will provide the bank with long-term funding, which CB needs to on-lend to SMEs prior to the privatization and to maintain its market share.  SMEs are key to Croatias continued economic growth, yet their potential is not being realized due to scarcity of funding.  This funding gap is still acute at present due to the shortage of alternative sources, such as leasing or factoring; and the preference of many banks for larger borrowers.  CB is one of the few banks actively providing term finance in this sector, yet faces market demand in excess of its current funding resources.  Further, CBs lending activities extend to the regions, where access to financing is more limited than in Zagreb.  The investment will make the bank more attractive to a potential strategic investor and improve the chances for successful  privatization.  With committed strategic partners and strong local management, CB would be well-positioned to become a leading provider of term finance.  IFCs provision of additional term funding would extend the maturity of, further stabilize, and diversify CBs funding base; while the associated financial covenants would help ensure the Bank maintains appropriate portfolio diversification and a prudent risk profile during their further expansion.

In the late 1990s, CB experienced problems with its portfolio.  In addition, the economic situation in Croatia deteriorated, and in September 1999, CB was taken over by the state, with all of the senior management replaced.

In 1996 CEPALCO ranked fourth among the 20 private utilities in the Philippines in terms of electricity sales and revenues.The project, to be implemented by CEPALCO, is to build and operate a 1 MW grid-connected solar photovoltaic (PV) power plant, which will be integrated into the CEPALCO electric distribution network in the city of Cagayan de Oro, on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines.  The PV plant will operate in conjunction with the recently built 7 MW Bubunawan run-of-the-river hydroelectric power plant. The hydro plant will operate as a load follower, varying part of its output inversely with the output from the PV plant.  The saved water will be stored in the hydro plant''s reservoir, to be utilized during peakload periods in which PV output is not available.  This conjunctive operation will, within the capacity of the PV-Hydro system, reduce CEPALCO''s peakload demands which would need otherwise to be supplied from thermal sources.The project''s main purpose is to act as a demonstration plant for proving the principle of conjunctive PV-hydro peak power generation.  While a number of large-size, grid-connected PV power plants have been built in recent years, all of them are located in developed countries.  None of them is operating conjunctively with a corresponding hydroelectric plant to augment peakload energy supplies.  In this respect, the CEPALCO plant will be the first one of its kind.The 1MW PV plant is expected to generate 1,100,000 kWh of clean electricity annually.  This amount of electricity will displace about 1,500 barrels of fuel oil per year, reducing carbon dioxide emissions of about 800 tonnes per year.  Apart from the global environmental benefit of reduced carbon dioxide emission, this project has additional local environmental benefits in terms of reduced emissions from diesel generation that would otherwise be used to generate the same amount of electricity.  It will also support the further development of a global market for solar PV technology. This demonstration project will improve the local distribution company''s technical competence in electricity generation from renewable sources and provide valuable know-how in the development and operation of clean energy distributed electricity generation.  Projects of this type benefit the local population because their electricity needs are met through clean technologies which guarantee a clean environment for the local population.The International Finance Corporation (IFC), acting as an executing agency on behalf of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank) in its capacity as an Implementing Agency of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), intends to finance up to US$4.0 million of the project costs from GEF resources.  IFC considers that the purpose of the GEF funding is to promote a demonstration plant for grid-connected applications of PV power plants in the developing world and to demonstrate the principle of conjunctive PV-hydro peak power generation.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects.

This will be the first modern tertiary hospital in Vietnam.  Diagnosis and surgical operations will be the key business lines of the hospital.  The project will have a modern ambulatory department, currently in acute shortage in Vietnam.  It will offer modern facilities, international quality services, a transparent pricing policy, and professional management.  The hospital industry in Vietnam is under-equipped and inefficient, and not able to respond effectively to the epidemiological changes occurring in the country.  Non-communicable diseases, such as cardiac problems, cancer, or accident injuries, have been increasing dramatically in Vietnam, but the existing medical facilities and services are inadequate to meet such rising demands.  As a result, patients have to ensure long waiting time for surgeries, unnecessarily long hospital stays, and hidden costs.  The hospital''s main target clientele will be middle income households in the HCMC metropolitan area and its neighboring provinces.  This facility will be an important model case for the development of private hospitals in Vietnam, as there are only very few private (local and foreign owned) hospitals in the country.The project will increase supply of high quality hospital service in Vietnam, and on the whole, improve the quality of hospital services in the country.  In doing so, the project will help relieve some of the burden placed on the public health system and channel their resources to increase service to lower income segment of the population. The hospital will provide modern facilities and a pool of French doctors who have long experience in different fields of services. The doctors will provide treatment services to the clients and train local medical staff. The hospital is expected to become the source of the best practice for the medical community in HCMC area by instituting professional management and training.

Webdunia is the leading provider of web-enabling technologies and content/media services in Indian languages.  Since inception in April 1999, the company has built a strong position in both the enabling technology and the media services components of the business and employs 125 people.  Webdunia offers a variety of Internet-based software applications for corporate partners and individuals, including webmail (590,000 users as of May 31, 2001), a transliteration engine (transferring Western characters into Indian languages via standard keyboard), search engines, e-greetings, discussion boards, and chat, in a total of 11 Indian languages.  The company operates portals in four languages (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam).  In addition, it provides customized language-enabling services and content to corporate clients and government.Developmental impact.  Webdunia plays a unique role as an enabler of growth for the Internet in India.  With only 6 percent of the Indian population (approximately 60 million people) conversant in English, increased availability of content and applications in local languages will be necessary for broader adoption of IT and the Internet.  This will have a positive impact on delivery of social services and e-government, corporate productivity, and strengthening of local cultures.  Through the project, IFC has the opportunity to support this critical component of the IT infrastructure in India  and play a catalytic role in increasing Internet access to the large majority of Indians who do not speak English.IFC Role.  The proposed IFC participation in the project would help bring strategic and venture investors to the company during a period of severe pullback in investment activity in early-stage companies in India.  The impact on technology firms with an India-centric revenue model has been particularly harsh.  Potential strategic investors have indicated that IFCs participation in the round will enable them to invest.  In addition, IFCs participation would raise the profile of the company and assist in customer acquisition on both the corporate and government markets.

Ipek Kagit was established by the Eczacibasi Group in 1970 as Turkey''s first large scale and modern tissue paper operation.  In 1998, Ipek Kagit undertook a US$86 million expansion and modernization project, which increased Ipek Kagits total tissue paper capacity by 50,000 tons per year (tpy) to 87,000 tpy and its converting capacity by 28,000 tpy to 53,000 tpy. As a response to the economic crisis in Turkey which has caused a contraction in the domestic market, Ipek Kagit intends to increase its tissue paper exports substantially. Consequently, Ipek Kagit has requested IFC to provide a medium-term financing of up to US$12 million to fund its increasing export operations. After the recent political and macro economical turmoil, interest rates in Turkey have skyrocketed and credits have become very scarce.  More importantly, local financial institutions do not provide the financial depth required for the long-term, outward looking strategic development of major corporations in Turkey.  Loan maturities exceeding even a one year range are currently not available to the Turkish market.  Without IFCs investment, Ipek Kagit would be forced to rely on extremely limited, short-term and more expensive financing which would adversely affect liquidity.  In the context of the uncertain economic environment and competitive pressures in the global industrial tissue paper sector, the project critically supports the sustained and competitive evolution of a vital Turkish corporation.  The proposed project will have a significant development impact. IFCs support of the project is critical at a time when higher inflation, shrinking domestic demand and price increases have stagnated the economy, especially manufacturing sector, which has brought about massive layoffs, causing severe economic and social instability in the country. Ipek Kagit is internationally competitive and export about 36,000 tons of its production, resulting in over US$36 million equivalent of foreign exchange earnings per year. Through the proposed investment, IFC will support a Turkish company ride out the financial difficulties to emerge as a stronger and more competitive company in the global setting.  IFCs participation of the project would provide comfort to other foreign investors who are wary of Turkeys perceived macro-economic and political risks, and encourage additional foreign direct financing and investment in Turkey. The devaluation of the currency has made Turkeys exports more attractive.  By providing the timely export financing, IFC will help Ipek Kagit seize the market opportunity, boost export sales and most importantly equip it with the financial resources needed to explore new export avenues, thereby increasing the countrys foreign exchange earnings.","","","","","","","","","","",This is a category C project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.

The company was created in 1993  through the acquisition of the repackaging equipment for cooling gases of the local subsidiary of the German firm HOECHST.  In 1993 HOECHST closed its activities in Cameroon and signed an exclusive representation contract for cooling gases with FME-GAZ. In 1995, the company diversified into the production of industrial gases in response to the increasing demand which CAMOA (Société Camerounaise d''Oxygène et d''Acétylène), a local subsidiary of the French AIR LIQUIDE Group, could not satisfy. The expansion entails the purchase and installation of the following equipment: (i) a second air separation plant for oxygen with a capacity of 30 m3/hour, bringing the total capacity to 45 m3/hour; (ii) the acquisition of some essential utilities (gas cylinders and trucks); and (iii) the expansion of the production facility to house the new oxygen unit and the construction of a loading plate-form.

The company employed 3,864 workers as of 2000 year-end. Teteks has a few non-textile subsidiaries in Macedonia including Teteks Banka.  Business activities of the non-banking subsidiaries include trading, recycling of waste materials from the textile operations, production of packaging materials mainly for the textile products, a gas station, transportation, and a travel agency.  Teteks also has representative offices in the U.S., Bulgaria, Germany, Croatia, Albania, Bosnia and FR Yugoslavia,  which serve to support the company''s export activities.  The proposed investment should assist Teteks in achieving its two core strategic objectives: (i) to increase exports by improving the quality and range of its products, and (ii) to reduce costs, both in an environmentally sound and socially responsible way.  The proposed project program encompasses the following main components.Textile operations modernization program:  Teteks plans to further modernize its spinning, weaving, knitting, and ready-made-garments facilities.  This investment should enhance Teteks'' export opportunities by both improving the quality of its products and its product development capacity and reducing its costs.   Energy efficiency and environment component:  A portion of the textile project, financed by a grant from the government of Netherlands, is investment in Teteks'' energy plant to reduce air and soil pollution and energy costs.  Teteks Corporate Citizenship Initiative (Teteks CCI):  A portion of the project is to establish the Teteks CCI with objective to provide financing to Teteks'' laid-off workers to help them start their own small businesses.  Through this initiative, Teteks would help the community by providing commercially sustainable market opportunities to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), creating new job opportunities, and fostering entrepreneurship.  Teteks Banka will be the manager of the Teteks CCI.

IFC''s involvement in this project enables long term loan financing for the project, both in terms of the IFC loan as well as a parallel loan from a local bank.  The local bank has approved their loan because of the IFC managed Mekong Project Development Facility (MPDF)  assistance to the project and IFC''s proposed financing.  Without IFC, significant long term funds would not have been available, and thus, the project would not have been able to go forward at this time.

With its 100% Lao ownership, the project fits both MPDF''s and the IFC Extending the Reach Program''s shared objective to promote development of local small and medium scale enterprises.  The venture is also in line with IFC''s overall strategy to support Lao PDR''s transition to a market economy while helping to meet the country''s need to earn and save foreign exchange.

The co-borrowers have been identified as principal users of the loan, with indicative amounts as incremental working capital requirements allotted to each of them.  However, on disbursement of the loan, the borrower will decide on the actual amount of distribution depending on the immediate and current working capital needs of the co-borrowers.The recent crisis in Turkey has severely curtailed domestic market demand in the manufacturing sector, presenting challenges for the corporate sector at large.  The Sisecam Group, which is dominant in the domestic glass market (67% of total sales), is attempting to mitigate the impact of falling sales by increasing exports. With an existing export base of about $330 million, which is expected to grow, the Group is faced with the challenge of finding dependable source of funding to finance its exports. Exports typically require higher working capital due to the longer receivables period and additional inventory carrying costs. The Group is funding its existing working capital requirements through short term debt financing, payable in one year, subject to rollover at renewal. In the past, such rollovers were routinely granted but, given the present state of the Turkish economy, Sisecam is finding it increasingly difficult to extend its short term debts from local or foreign banks.  Local Turkish Lira loans from Turkish Eximbank are harder to obtain, while foreign banks have reached their Turkish exposure limits and are unwilling to extend existing or new loans.  As a result, the Group is looking to IFC to provide a dependable and stable source of future financing for working capital needs with a $35 million loan.  This loan would mitigate some of Sisecam''s liquidity constraints and increase its export marketing capacity. After the recent political and macro economical turmoil, interest rates in Turkey have increased sharply and credits have become very scarce.  More importantly, local financial institutions do not provide the financial depth required for the long-term, outward looking strategic development of major corporations in Turkey.  Loan maturities exceeding even a one year range are currently not available to the Turkish market.  In addition, Turkish Eximbank does not have sufficient resources to provide Sisecam''s export credit requirements and to process the applications in a timely manner.  Without IFCs investment, the Group would be forced to rely on extremely limited, short-term and more expensive financing which would adversely affect liquidity.  In the context of the uncertain economic environment and competitive pressures in the regional glass sector, the project critically supports the sustained and competitive evolution of a vital Turkish corporation.","","","","","","","","","","",This is a category C project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.

The loan is fully disbursed and was originally intended to be converted, in whole or part, before June 30, 2000.  However, owing to delays caused by post-privatization uncertainty over the shareholding structure of BP, IFC was not willing to convert last year.  At the time of the privatization, GE Capital (GE) was to be the strategic technical partner, taking 35% of BP, with Banco Portugues de Investimento (BPI) taking 10%.  The remainder was to remain with local shareholders, and both IFC and EBRD provided US$10 million pre-privatization loans with options to convert into equity at the average price paid by GE and BPI.  Payment for the shares was to have been made in 12 installments.  However, after three installments, GE decided to withdraw from the transaction, and the success of the privatization looked to be in jeopardy.  Largely due to the support of IFC and the efforts of BPI,  the Greek Eurobank (EFG) was brought in to replace GE.  At the insistence of the Romanian authorities, GE remains with the shares that it had already paid for.  With all these changes, it is now apparent that our existing loan does not match the current or future needs of BP or its shareholders.  To meet EFG''s growth targets, BP needs equity or tier 2 capital, but our existing facility is a senior loan which has already started amortizing.  IFC''s convertible pre-privatization loan to BP supported the bank''s privatization and facilitated the entry of a strategic technical partner.

GMFI Micro Enterprise Bank Kosovo,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,World Region,PROCREDIT BANK SH.A,Regional Industry - FIG - ECA,2001-08-02T04:00:00Z,2001-09-30T04:00:00Z,FI,Equity,"Operating since January 2000, MEB Kosovo is a specialized provider of credit and financial services to private micro and small enterprises in Kosovo.  As of the end of May 2001, total credit provided was US$15.9 million equivalent, including a loan portfolio of over 1,200 accounts totalling US$5.7 million equivalent, with an average loan size of about US$4,700 and average maturity of ten months.  Portfolio quality is high, with the end-May arrears rate reported at 0.5%; the sectoral distribution of the portfolio was 65% to trading enterprises, 20% to the light manufacturing sector, and 15% to the service sector.  The bank reported net income of US$3.7 million in 2000.  MEB Kosovo has experienced an exceptionally high rate of deposit mobilization.  Customer deposits were US$110.0 million as of end-May, representing 36,563 depositors.Although initially developed to provide microcredit, MEB Kosovo quickly has become a key part of the payments infrastructure of Kosovo -- an infrastructure which was wiped out by the conflict in the former Yugoslav province.  The bank has, in addition, developed a considerable international transfer business and has attracted a large deposit base of over US$100.0 million.  This is a major achievement, considering the widespread losses depositors suffered due to wartime confiscation of savings accounts, and the collapse of pyramid savings schemes during the early 1990s.  It is estimated that about 90% of Kosovo''s money supply is still held outside the banking system.  In common with the other parts of the former Yugoslavia, therefore, there is a need to support new, professionally-managed and credible financial institutions in Kosovo which can be trusted as both deposit-taking and lending institutions.  Following its very successful launch, MEB Kosovo strategy in 2001/02 is to build on its province-wide presence by establishing itself as the main lender to the MSE sector.Microfinance schemes have shown a major positive impact in reducing poverty and unemployment in emerging markets worldwide, and -- in recognition of this strong developmental impact -- almost all multilateral and bilateral institutions and donor agencies are actively promoting microfinance schemes.  The developmental impact of commercially-run microcredit programs in particular, on post-confict transition economy populations with little or no access to formal credit institutions has been well-demonstrated by IFC''s microcredit investments in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania.  IFC''s developmental strategy in the field is to attract serious private sector investment in microfinance by demonstrating that microfinance can be a viable commercial proposition.The proposed investment in MEB Kosovo is expected to be strongly developmental -- in terms of its economic impacts, stimulus for business reconstruction, employment generation, confidence-building in the banking sector, and introduction of commercially-oriented microfinance techniques to Kosovo.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a category FI Type 1 project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedure.

Astana Tower Business and Shopping Center,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,Kazakhstan,Astana Business and Shopping Center,Regional Industry MAS MCT,2001-08-08T04:00:00Z,2001-09-07T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"The project involves the development of a greenfield business and shopping center in view of the anticipated demand for quality office and shopping space in Astana. In 1998, Astana became Kazakhstan''s new capital and most of the national government administration has since been moved from Almaty to Astana.  Businesses and foreign investors have also started to establish their presence in the capital city.  However, the lack of quality business infrastructure has been an impediment to more rapid movement of businesses to Astana, and has hindered Astana''s emergence as a fully developed new capital.  Astana Business and Shopping Center (ABS, or the company) responds to this growing need for modern business and office space in the emerging capital city of Kazakhstan.  In Astana, ABS is the first business and shopping center built to international standards. ABS is located in a busy area of Astana at the intersection of one of the citys busiest avenues leading to  government, city administration, and diplomatic quarters.  The project was designed by Turkish architects and has been developed by Ahsel Group, which has been active and known in Kazakhstan, most notably through its Regent Ankara Hotel in Almaty.  ABS consists of a 20-floor office/ residential tower and a 3-floor shopping area, which is connected to the tower at the ground floor.  The building is suitable for international companies and is equipped with modern facilities, including a fitness center, central heating and air-conditioning, security systems, information technology network, communications systems, fire/ smoke detectors and sprinklers.  Development Impact:  The projects developmental impact is expected to be significant since the project will help upgrade the local business environment, introduce modern business practices, and provide shopping facilities in the local community.  The project will help attract private businesses and foreign capital to Astana and help develop the new capital of Kazakhstan.  IFC Role:  The project is in line with the Kazakh government''s priority to rapidly establish the city as the nation''s capital by encouraging influx of private businesses in Astana as well.  Astana is likely to attract more businesses to relocate from Almaty if the currently available business and office infrastructure is upgraded to meet required international standards. IFC''s investment would signal confidence in the development of private sector activity in Astana and private investment in Kazakhstan.  IFC will provide the company with long-term financing, which is not available in the local market.  Furthermore, IFC has introduced Ahsel Group to the World Trade Center organization, which is seeking to extend its network into Kazakhstan and is considering locating their operation in Astana Tower.  This is likely to significantly benefit Kazakhstan''s integration with overseas markets.

Currently, the company is focused on the Hong Kong market of which many of its clients have their manufacturing bases in Southern China. In the aggregate these businesses employ about 19,000 people and are typically five to seven year old, family owned and managed businesses, involved in light manufacturing or distribution businesses. The company would use IFC''s investment to complete its technology development, securitize its portfolio and expand its operations into the emerging markets.IFC''s RoleProvision of risk capital.  IFC will be providing financing to a new enterprise which is using new technology for expansion into riskier markets.  It would be difficult to find traditional sources of financing for that type of a venture.IFC will facilitate implementation of the company''s expansion plans.  IFC has significant amount of knowledge on the small and medium enterprise (SME) sectors in China, Philippines, Thailand, India and Korea accumulated through studies, project development facilities and partnerships with local financial institutions.  Using this knowledge, IFC will help identify prospects for the international deployment of SMELoan''s technology.  Developmental ImpactThe developmental significance of this project is related to its potential impact of the technology for SME lending. High transaction costs, high risks and collateral requirements have been the main factors constraining SMEs access to bank lending. The project develops and employs a new business model that not only lowers customer acquisition costs, but also dramatically improves core credit and customer management processes by relying on internet technologies for standardization and real-time access to information on the performance of the borrower. The model relaxes the collateral constraint to SME lending by making it easier to base credit decisions on the use of account receivables as collateral as opposed to real estate for instance.    The technology has the potential of increasing competition in the credit market, by providing new entrants with the ability to manage a large number of borrowers while closely managing the credit risk of each individual account. The efficiency and scalability of online lending will not only allow the company to compete against more traditional banks, but it would also allow it to target the kind of small businesses that banks are wary of lending to because of the high costs of servicing the loan. This is expected to have a strong demonstration effect and create pressure on banks to adopt new practices in their SME lending. Increased competition among financial institutions would benefit SMEs.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a  Financial Intermediary Type 1 project.

Baltiskii Leasing,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,Russian Federation,"BALTISKI LES, OOO",Regional Industry - FIG - ECA,2001-09-10T04:00:00Z,2001-10-10T04:00:00Z,FI,Loan,"The company''s primary business is writing financial leases for its customers, Russian corporates primarily located in the north-west region.  Assets leased include light and heavy industrial equipment, office equipment, vehicles, printing equipment, and trade equipment for retail outlets.  Over 90% of this equipment is imported from vendors of international repute.  Clients identify equipment vendors and define the exact type and specifications of equipment required.  Baltiskii''s role is that of a financing intermediary, with clients carrying the risks associated with choice of equipment, delivery, and installation.  Property insurance is mandatory in most cases, with Baltiskii retaining close control over choice of insurer and type of policy acquired. The proposed investment will finance individual leases as they are generated.  It is expected that the company would pledge assets purchased under each lease to IFC and assign future payment streams from lease agreements to IFC.  This arrangement is consistent with existing procedures whereby all of Baltiskii''s leases are pledged to its financing banks.  The total amount of the credit line would be limited by the company''s equity and indebtedness.  Purpose of projectIFC''s financial sector strategy in Russia is to create new financial intermediaries and strengthen existing financial institutions.  Leasing is one of the most effective ways to provide financing to small and medium enterprises (SMEs); this is especially true in Russia, which is characterized by a low capitalized banking sector.  This project will strengthen an existing Russian financial institution and help direct much needed longer term finance, through leasing, to local Russian SMEs.Development impactThe project will achieve a high development impact for the following reasons:· IFC''s financing will be used by Russian SMEs to upgrade capital assets and therefore improve their competitiveness;· The term of IFC financing will allow Baltiskii to write longer-term leases, thereby serving to change the generally short-term nature of the leasing market in Russia;· By introducing an Operational & Policy Manual, IFC will upgrade Baltiskiis internal processes and improve management control over the Company. IFC roleAn important part of the development of this investment has been the involvement of the IFC technical assistance program in Russia (the Private Enterprise Partnership). Since 1997, IFC has been actively involved in the development of the Russian leasing industry.  With funding from the Canadian government, IFCs Leasing Development Group (LDG) has been conducting an extensive technical assistance project.  The project currently consists of 11 full-time leasing specialists (lawyers, financial analysts, training and PR specialists).  This team provides training, consulting services and informational support to Russian and foreign leasing companies, equipment vendors, existing and potential lessees, government and business development agencies.  The LDG has also been actively involved in improving the legislative environment for leasing through direct advisory work with the State Duma of the Russian Federation and with various ministries in the executive branch.  The LDG has created a website www.ifc.org/russianleasing which contains a comprehensive description of the project''s activities. The proposed project provides one of the best examples of where IFC can capitalize on its technical assistance efforts to promote investment opportunities.  The proposed line of credit would provide Baltiskii with an alternative, more economical, and longer term source of financing, thereby allowing the company to grow and expand its operations.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Financial Intermediary (FI) Type 2 project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.

The companys principal products are aluminum coil, sheets and foil as well as galvanized steel. The installed capacities for the various processes at Assan when all the project items are installed and commissioned would be as follows: (i) continuous casting capacity (casters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7) of 180,000 tons; (ii) cold rolling capacity of 145,000 tons; and (iii) foil production capacity of 35,000 tons annually.The project involves capacity expansion, modernization and de-bottlenecking of an existing aluminum plant, Assan Aluminum (Assan or company), one of the leading Turkish manufacturers of rolled aluminum and galvanized steel products. The proposed expansion in the company''s rolled aluminum and foil production capacity includes new equipment, working capital, and investment period expenses. The project, which is expected to be completed in 2003, would increase Assans production capacity from its existing 52,000 metric tons (mts) of flat rolled aluminum product (FRP) and 18,000 mts of foil to 85,000 mts of FRP and 35,000 mts of foil respectively.  The proposed expansion will also allow the company to add slitting capacity that will accommodate its existing cold mills and to handle evolving product mix (thicker than 1.5mm and wider than 2000mm).   The project is aimed to fill a significant void in the Turkish and European rolled aluminum market, and to help Assan broaden its range of products, which will enhance the company''s position to compete with the other European producers.Development Impact & IFC Role:The project is expected to have a positive economic impact through the addition of new technology, reduced production costs, and increased supply of international quality aluminum sheet and foil, for downstream industrial customers, houseware, construction, packaging, and the automotive industry.  The expansion project will further improve Assan''s international competitiveness in the aluminum sector by offering a wider range of quality products.  In addition, the project will allow Turkey to benefit from the proceeds generated from the exports to neighboring countries and Europe which will also help the Turkish economy to recover from its economical turmoil.IFCs participation in the project would also provide reassurance to other foreign investors who are wary of Turkey''s perceived macro-economic and political risks, and encourage additional foreign direct financing and investment in Turkey.  The devaluation of the currency has made Turkey''s exports more attractive.  By providing the timely financing, IFC will help Assan seize the market opportunity, increase exports and thereby increase the country''s foreign currency earnings.  Finally, the project will make Assan the undeniable leader in the use of speed-casting technology for producing a wide range of flat rolled aluminum alloys. Assan could use the technology developed to forge strategic alliances with other manufacturers thereby promoting more eco-efficient production methods for these products. IFC has a strong role to play in this project especially after the effect of the most recent economic crises in Turkey.  First, the provision of long term financing with reasonable interest rate has become very scarce especially from the local Turkish banks. Loan maturities exceeding even a one year range are currently not available to the Turkish market. IFC''s financing will allow the project to be leveraged with a long term foreign currency loan without burdening the company with a heavy interest rate.  At this time, without IFC''s proposed financing, Assan would be forced to postpone the project or rely on much more expensive medium and short-term financing which would squeeze its cash generation. Second, IFCs involvement will allow the Corporation to continue to leverage a strong client relationship to support a successful project in a difficult environment.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityThe ERS will be posted at the gate of Assan''s plant in Izmit starting September 11, 2001.

It also has investments in the cement industry through its subsidiary, Cemento Yura, S.A.  In 2000, Gloria reported sales of US$226.6 million.  The food division (90% of sales) is primarily involved in the production, sale, and distribution of dairy products including evaporated, condensed, and UHT milk, yogurt, and cheese. The company also distributes canned fish and fruit juices with its Gloria brand name. The pharmaceutical division (5% of sales) produces and distributes a range of drugs and cosmetic products. The paper division (5% of sales) manufactures corrugated board, boxes and liner.   Gloria has had a leadership position in the Peruvian dairy industry for 50 years. It was founded in 1941 in Arequipa, Peru, as Leche Gloria, S.A. with majority ownership by General Mills company of the U.S. and subsequently by Nestle.  The present shareholders acquired the company in 1986 from both local shareholders and from Nestle, and have since progressively grown the business into its present more diversified profile. In 1998, the company started a strategic investment program (the project) whose main objectives were to (i) consolidate and rationalize its dairy sector operations into a new production facility in Huachipa, near Lima; (ii) build a new UHT plant; (iii) expand domestic milk collection; and (iv) upgrade its paper division with a new plant in Huachipa.  The project will allow Gloria to expand northward from its traditional base in Arequipa, southern Peru, bringing it closer to its main consumer markets.  Development Impact: IFCs support of Gloria will have a positive development impact in Peru in three areas:  First, the project will  support rural farmers serving the Peruvian dairy industry with technical assistance (Gloria assists its suppliers by providing technical assistance including breeding stock improvements, cattle nutrition to improve quality and yields; veterinary services) and reliable market access with guaranteed daily milk collection and regular payments;  Second, IFC will support an important Peruvian employer: the company has 1,720 employees and its operations are highly integrated, extending into many remote and rural communities.  The company works with 15,000 farmers, most with less than 10 head of cattle; only 5% of Gloria''s suppliers have more than 100 head of cattle; and  Third: Gloria''s activities will increase the consumption of safe, quality, pasteurized milk in rural areas in Peru by making available both canned and UHT products (which require no refrigeration and have a long shelf-life) through its extensive distribution network.  Perus milk consumption has shown an increased trend, but it is currently only 58 liters per capita p.a., compared with the FAO recommended level of 121 liters per capita, p.a. (source: USDA Peru: Dairy situation 2000).  Finally, Peru is a milk deficit country.  The project will help further develop the Peruvian dairy industry, and the government of Peru is encouraging greater domestic milk collection and dairy production as a way of reducing milk imports. IFC Role: Among its other contributions, IFC will provide Gloria with long-term financing currently not available locally.  Gloria embarked on its strategic investment program prior to Peru''s financial distress of 1999 and political crisis of 1999-2001.   Due to recession and political uncertainty in Peru, the company approached IFC for long-term financing on terms not available locally.  The company requires adequate tenor given that it has entered a consolidation phase in which it will integrate new assets and complete the rationalization of its operations between its traditional southern base in Arequipa and its new plant in Huachipa, Lima.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityEnvironmental documents related to this project are available in Cajamarca and in Arequipa, Peru, as disclosed in local newspapers.

Huarong is mandated to maximize recovery through management and disposition of NPLs through various exit options, including voluntary transfers, discounted pay-offs, loan restructurings, foreclosures, debt-equity swaps and portfolio auctions.  Purpose of Project: The purpose of IFC''s support to this auction is to encourage a transaction that is fair, transparent, and follows international best practices, one which would set a precedent for future sales and help provide much-needed momentum to the development of the NPL market in China. Development impact/IFC''s role: IFC''s participation would lend essential credibility to a landmark transaction, the success of which will accelerate the development of a Chinese NPL market and help restructure the banking system.  IFC''s role would contribute to encourage foreign participation, increase competition, restructure assets and help develop a local NPL market.  Through years of lending to unprofitable state-owned enterprises, the Chinese banking system has accumulated a vast amount of NPLs, estimated to be as much as US$440 billion, equivalent to 42% of 2000 GDP.  A developed NPL market is needed to help China resolve a massive NPL problem that, if left unresolved, could hamper the country''s growth.","","","","","","","","","","","The winning bidder will be required to have policies, procedures and organizational arrangements in place to ensure that environmental risks are identified, evaluated and managed as appropriate.

Pasabahce-Eskisheir (II),Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,Türkiye,Pasabahce-Schott Cam Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S.,Regional Industry MAS MCT,2001-09-27T04:00:00Z,2001-10-29T05:00:00Z,C,Loan,"Pasabahce-Eskisehir was originally incorporated in 1998 as Pasabahce-Schott, a joint venture between Pasabahce Cam of Turkey and Schott-Zwiesel of Germany. Sisecam  and Carl Zeiss Stiftung (CZS) were the two sponsors and equal shareholders.  Sisecam/Pasabahce was to provide technical and production expertise and Schott was responsible for marketing and sales.  A greenfield plant was commissioned in Eskisehir, Turkey at a cost of approximately DM114 million (US$60 million), partly financed by an IFC A loan of DM29 million and two B loans aggregating DM29 million (Dresdner: DM19 million; Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz: DM10 million).  However, in June 1999, Schott expressed its intention to terminate the joint venture for commercial reasons and the plant was shut down in July 1999.  As a result, both B Lenders, which had initially participated in the project financing due to their existing relationship with Schott, indicated that they would make a formal request for a prepayment, as Schott''s imminent departure amounted to a material adverse change in the project.  After lengthy negotiations, a solution was reached which was satisfactory to all parties concerned.  An amendatory project funds agreement was signed on March 2000, where Schott''s support was provided until November 30, 2001 and the B lenders agreed to remain in the project till July 31, 2001, after which they were granted the right to demand repayment for the full outstanding loan amount.  The project plant resumed operations in March 2000.  Schott sold its shares in the company to Sisecam and remained in the project solely to provide project funds support.  Satisfactory progress was made since operations were resumed, the project is performing, and the loans are being serviced on time.  However, after July 31, 2001, and in line with the Amendatory PFA, the two B lenders have asked for repayment for the full amount of their outstanding loans, despite all efforts undertaken by the B Loan Management Division to try to convince the B lenders to remain in the project. The  B lenders did so because they considered the country risk shifting to Turkey as the Schott guarantee will soon be extinguished on November 30, 2001, and the B Lenders do not want to assume further Turkey risk given the deteriorating macro-economic situation beginning from November 2000.The recent economic crisis in Turkey has resulted in a severe debt scarcity, particularly for the manufacturing sector.  Commercial banks and financial institutions operating in the country are not willing or able to extend long-term credit to Turkish companies.  Foreign banks in particular have reached their Turkish exposure limits, or have revised their country strategy, and are reluctant to extend existing or new loans, and local TL loans from Turkish Eximbank are almost nonexistent.  Long-term hard currency loans are impossible to obtain, whereas short-term debt is priced expensively and is not guaranteed to be rolled over automatically, as was done routinely in the past.    Pasabahce-Eskisehir, already faced with the prospect of reduced revenue and cash flow due to the contraction in the domestic market, would find it very difficult to raise the additional financing required to make the full repayment as requested by the B lenders, and the Company''s liquidity would be severely curtailed.  As a result, the company has requested IFC to provide a dependable and stable source of long-term financing, to provide the liquidity required to replace the existing B lenders in full.  This loan would allow Pasabahce-Eskisehir to continue to focus on its core competences and concentrate on increasing its export revenue to compensate for the shortfall in the domestic revenues.The proposed investment will have a significant development impact. IFCs support is critical at a time when high inflation, shrinking domestic demand and price increases have stagnated the economy, especially the manufacturing sector, and have brought about severe economic problems in the country.  Pasabahce-Eskisehir is a competitive glass tableware manufacturer that exports about 70% of its aggregate glass production, with a projected foreign exchange revenue of approximately US$25 million in 2001.  The company also employs a workforce of 250 people, and is a conscientious corporate citizen.  Through the proposed investment, IFC will support a Turkish company as it rides out current financial difficulties to emerge as a stronger and more competitive entity.  IFCs participation in the project would also provide comfort to other foreign investors who are wary of Turkey''s perceived macro-economic and political risks, and encourage additional foreign direct financing and investment in Turkey.  The devaluation of the currency has made Turkey''s exports more attractive.  By providing the timely replacement loan, IFC will allow Pasabahce-Eskisehir to seize this opportunity and focus on increasing its exports and improving its international competitiveness instead of having to divert resources to raise additional financing to pay off the two B lenders.  The proposed investment will also allow the company to continue normal operations and therefore keep its workforce intact, which is very important especially in a time when economic contraction is resulting in increased unemployment.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category C project, according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because it is likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts.Location of environmental documents In locally affected community","The project sponsor is Turkiye Sise ve Cam Fabrikalari A.S.

Onlending will be carried out for investments in the areas of sanitation, development of water and sewage services, small power plants including biomass-based energy plants, industrial expansion and environment support. The proposed project is a response to the following:a) Strong demand for, and inadequate availability of, long-term financing for private infrastructure projects.b) Inadequate financial resources for the private sector and exports.Even for the more efficient firms, capital scarcity has been a major constraint to modernize plant and equipment, to expand in order to meet external competition, or take advantage of new opportunities opened by changes in relative prices.

Within three years of the share sale, all the land occupied by the company will be re-registered to grant 50-year leases of the land to EVR. Baltic Railway Services won the bid and purchased 66% of EVRs shares on August 31, 2001. EVR is a vertically integrated railway which includes the management of fixed infrastructure (track, bridges, stations, signaling and communications, etc.) and operation of freight transport services. EVR is the dominant freight operator in Estonia and operates a 693 km long railway network in Estonia. The principal route consists of the main 210 km west-east axis from Tallinn to the Russian border at Narva. The first 77.5 km are double track as far as Tapa where a second route branches off towards Tartu in the south. At Tartu, the line further divides into a route into Russia via Petseri and also to Latvia via Valga. According to EU rules, Estonia has separated the operation of trains and ownership of rail infrastructure. As the owner of the railway network EVR is required to maintain the network and provide network access to the various licensed passenger operators and freight operators in return for a track access charge. The IFC project comprises: (i) the companys investment plan over the next five years including the replacement of EVRs locomotive fleet, track replacement and renovation, improvement of signaling and communications, station renewals and investments in environmental protection; and (ii) the acquisition of 66% of EVRs shares by BRS.

The Company was awarded a 15-year license in February 2000 for this purpose, with an open tender bid price of US$47.5 million.  The project would help meet the need for better telecommunications services in Jamaica through the promotion of competition in the domestic market.  Currently, the market is serviced by two operators, Cable and Wireless Jamaica (CWJ) and the Company.  Since CWJ entered the market in 1986 with the privatization of the state-controlled telephone company, it had enjoyed exclusive operating rights in both fixed and mobile services until April 2001.  The introduction of competition has lowered tariffs, improved the quality of service and customer responsiveness, and expanded access to telecommunication services to a broader segment of the Jamaican population.  IFC''s direct investment and the resultant competition have thereby helped raise the country''s mobile penetration rate from 6.5% in June 2000 to over 15% by October 2001.  IFCs direct investment in the expansion of this network would help the emerging competitive market to develop further by (1) increasing telecommunications usage nation-wide, (2) improving the efficiency of the business sector, and (3) increasing the connections between Jamaica and the global community.

This project will support efforts to catalyze growth and development through high-end services exports, creating quality jobs and also acting as an important symbol of the benefits of continued reform, opening up, and support for education.  The project will have significant developmental impact by: (i) potentially creating hundreds of highly skilled software development jobs in Vietnam over the next two to three years; and (ii) helping to train workers in Vietnam by exposing them to international best practices. This venture would contribute to bring higher standards of software development to companies in Vietnam.  In addition, while salaries for IT workers in Vietnam are extremely low by international standards, GCS is one of the best paying employers in the local market.  The companys business plan calls for the employment of approximately 800 software engineers in Vietnam by the end of 2004.While IFC has made twelve investments to date in Vietnam, GCS would is the first ever investment in the ICT sector and only the third IFC equity investment in the country.  An investment in GCS would represent an opportunity for IFC to support the emerging Vietnamese software industry, which is still at a nascent stage.  The project would support a group of local entrepreneurs that are providing software outsourcing services to the semiconductor industry in the developed world from a production base centered in Vietnam.   IFC''s participation would also be critical to terms of bringing another institutional investor into the Series A round.  There is little active venture capital in the ICT sector at the present time, and IFC will have to use its own contacts in the venture capital community and technology sector to help the Company close the Series A round.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category C project, according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because it is likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts.Location of environmental documents In locally affected community","Global Cybersoft (GCS, or the company) has a committed management team with extensive expertise in the semiconductor industry as well as business contacts in the USA, Japan, Taiwan, and Korea.

Tigar,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,World Region,Tigar M.H.,"Gbl Ind, Manufact, Agribus & Services",2001-10-31T05:00:00Z,2001-12-03T05:00:00Z,B,Loan,"The project supports the growth and strategic development of Tigar, a leading tire and rubber goods producer in Yugoslavia and the Balkans.   With the return of Yugoslavia to the international community, Tigar is planning to undertake a comprehensive corporate restructuring and investment program (the project) and has approached IFC for financial support.  The project involves; (i) debottlenecking and expanding its tire production capacity, which currently operates at 100% capacity, and moving into production of premium high speed tires; (ii) restructuring of non-core assets and businesses, and (iii) balance sheet restructuring to better match assets and liabilities.  Given that the project had been postponed due to circumstances outside its control, Tigar now wants to move quickly and IFC''s proposed project is structured to be responsive to this need.   The proposed project has a strong development impact.  Through this investment, IFC would be supporting the continuation of the transfer of technology to Yugoslavia.  The company is expected to be internationally competitive and export most of its production, resulting in over EUR30 million equivalent of foreign exchange revenues per year.  Moreover, this restructuring project will help employees of Tigar, especially among the tire producing units, secure their jobs in an environment where tens of thousands of employees are being laid off in various sectors in Yugoslavia. After a decade of war, international isolation and poor economic management, there is low degree of financial intermediation in FRY and the mobilization of resources for new investment is negligible.  The banking system has a very low level of capitalization and extremely low intermediation capacity.  The financial difficulties of the major state owned banks preclude them from servicing the growing demands of the private sector.  Private banks are mostly small, thinly capitalized, and only offer short-term (1-3 month) working capital.  Private companies have little or no access to external finance.  As a result, interest rates are prohibitively high and local financial institutions do not have the financial depth required for the long-term, outward looking strategic development of major corporations in the country.  Loan maturities exceeding even a one-year range are not currently available in the  market.  In the context of an uncertain economic environment and competitive pressures in the global tire sector, IFC''s proposed long term financing of the project will provide critical support for the sustained and competitive evolution of a vital corporate sector enterprise in FRY.  Without IFCs investment, the company would be forced to rely on short term, extremely limited and very expensive financing.  While Michelin has had and will continue to have direct corporate exposure to Yugoslavia, its appetite for such exposure will in fact be enhanced by IFC''s participation in the venture.  IFC is working with the sponsors to structure a bankable investment program and ensure fair burden sharing amongst the parties.  IFC is also planning to provide technical assistance to Tigar with a view to eventually restructuring its non tire businesses  to preserve jobs and develop value-added business opportunities.Tigar is keen to have an environmental audit of operations and assistance to correct any deficiencies. IFC will also provide funding needed for environmental enhancement.The proposed project will have a strong demonstration impact by supporting the investment of a leading tire manufacturer (Michelin) in FRY.  IFC financing is likely to encourage additional foreign direct financing and investment in Yugoslavia,  at a time when foreign investors are wary of Yugoslavias perceived macro-economic and political risks.  In the event that syndication is possible, it would be an enhancement of local companies'' credit worthiness in Yugoslavia.   In line with IFC''s view of developing Yugoslavia''s industry base, the project  supports research and development (in cooperation with Yugoslav technical institutions), new product development initiatives, and manufacturing technologies, which promote global competitiveness on the technology front.  In addition, by supporting a leading outward looking, regional company, IFC fosters the transfer of first-class production methods, strong environmental, health, and management systems in a country that has urgent needs to renovate its industrial base.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityThe translated environmental documents will be disclosed at the following locations:1.

Soktas has three principal products: (i) fine count, yarn-dyed fabric (shirting); (ii) piece-dyed  fabric (sportswear); and (iii) grey, unfinished fabrics.  The recent crisis in Turkey has severely curtailed domestic market demand in the manufacturing sector, presenting challenges for the corporate sector at large.  Soktas is attempting to mitigate the impact of falling domestic sales by increasing its exports.  With an existing export base of about US$21 million as of end 2000 (representing 40% of total sales), which is expected to grow to reach about US$34.0 million (70% of sales) as of end 2001, the company is faced with the challenge of finding dependable sources of funding to finance its increasing exports.   Exports typically require higher working capital, due to the longer receivables period, and additional inventory carrying costs. The company is funding its existing working capital requirements through short term debt financing, payable in one year, subject to rollover at renewal.  In the past, such rollovers were routinely granted but, given the present state of the Turkish economy, Soktas is finding it increasingly difficult to extend its short term debts from local or foreign banks.  Local TL loans are harder to obtain, while foreign banks have reached their Turkish exposure limits and are unwilling to extend existing or new loans.  As a result, Skotas is looking to IFC to provide a dependable and stable source of future financing for its working capital needs.  This loan would mitigate some of Soktas''s liquidity constraints and increase its export marketing capacity. The proposed project gives IFC an opportunity to support an existing client at a critical time, when higher inflation, shrinking domestic demand and price increases have stagnated the economy, and especially the manufacturing sector. By financing Soktas''s working capital needs on a long-term basis, IFC will allow the company to focus on building its export base, while also helping it to weather out the difficulties in the domestic market. Through the proposed investment, IFC will thus support a Turkish company to emerge as a stronger and more competitive company in the global setting. IFC''s participation in the project will also provide comfort to other foreign investors who are wary of Turkey''s perceived macro economic and political risks, and will thus encourage foreign direct financing and investments in Turkey. Furthermore, the devaluation of the currency has made Turkey''s exports more attractive. By providing the timely export financing, IFC will aid the company in seizing the market opportunity, boosting its export sales, and will most importantly equip the company with the financial resources it needs to explore new avenues, thereby increasing the country''s foreign exchange earnings","","","","","","","","","","","This is a category C project according to IFCs environmental and social procedure and as such the project has been cleared by the Environmental and Social Development Department.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityCategory C projects have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts.

During the 1990s, the group established companies that moved to leadership positions in various sectors, including insurance, pension fund management, health care, banking and various retail and service sectors.  Due to the peculiarities of the Colombian market, most investments were funded from within the group (by the holding companies together with other group companies that had excess cash balances).  While this approach has served SIG well over time it has created a complex web of cross-shareholdings among group companies, thereby making them less transparent to external investors.As part of the project, IFC will (i) assist SIG in the elimination of some of these cross-shareholdings; (ii) advise it on measures to improve corporate governance and transparency; and (iii) help it to significantly reduce the debt that has accumulated at the holding companies level as a result of the current structure. The attractiveness of this Project for IFC stems not only from the direct benefits which would accrue to some of Colombias key companies (which are part of the Suramericana Group) but also from the benchmarks it will set for other Colombian companies in areas such as corporate governance and transparency that are key to the efficient functioning of domestic capital markets.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects.

The company develops highly specialized capital markets and risk management information systems, including off-the-shelf software products and customized solutions and consulting services.  Egar targets trading and risk management departments of large banks, corporate treasuries, and specialized smaller and middle market financial institutions.  The company blends Russian software development and mathematical talent, and US business development and managerial know-how.  The Russian base of the project gives Egar a competitive cost structure and access to professionals with highly developed quantitative skills which are critical to the development of risk management tools. The purpose of the proposed project is to improve product development and R&D, expand its Russian development centers, build up sales and marketing infrastructure, and its working capital needs.Russia is in the midst of developing the skills base necessary to compete in high-technology exports.  This project will support efforts to catalyze growth and development through high-end services exports, creating quality jobs, and acting as a symbol of the benefits of continued reform, opening up support for education and partnering with western organizations and professionals.  The project will have significant developmental impact by potentially creating hundreds of IT related jobs in Russia.  The company currently employs about 100 people in Moscow and has recently opened a second development center in Nishny Novgorod.  In 2004 Egar expects to employ about 350 people in Russia.  Egar will also contribute to train skilled technology workers in Russia by exposing them to best practices from U.S. based technology firms.  There is, at present, a shortage of qualified managers in the IT sector in Russia.  This is a significant bottleneck to further the technological development across the country, since most companies , particularly small and medium enterprises, do not have access to U.S. and western European technology expertise.  Finally, Russia and Eastern Europe will also be important target markets for Egar, contributing to the improvement in the efficiency of financial institutions in this region through providing state-of-the-art technology and services.IFCs investment would support a company that creates intellectual property and provides highly specialized software services to companies globally, from a production base centered in a developing country with highly qualified human resources.  IFC would play a critical role in bringing in other investors, for the current as well as potential future rounds because of concerns regarding country risk.  The scarcity of capital available for projects such as this, from private U.S. sources, is demonstrated by the fact that the company has only been able to raise financing from a Russia based institution funded by USAID.

MK is targeting sales of US$52 million this year, with exports of about US$16 million. The proposed project will be the IFC''s second project with the company, the first being for MK''s US$110 million capacity expansion program for 1998-2000, which increased the company''s production capacity from 90,000 tons p.a. to 290,000 tons p.a. Full capacity utilization by MK is expected to be reached by 2004, which, along with the increase in exports, will create additional working capital needs. The proposed investment will be used to finance the incremental working capital needs of the company until full capacity utilization is reached.The recent crisis in Turkey has severely curtailed domestic market demand in the manufacturing sector, presenting challenges for the corporate sector at large. MK is finding that it has to increasingly rely on exports to make up for the loss in the domestic market. With an existing export base of US$4 million in 2000, which is expected to grow to US$30 million by 2004, the company is faced with the challenge of finding dependable sources of funding to finance its exports. However, the financial crisis has made access to bank financing very difficult for Turkish corporates such as MK, since interest rates have increased sharply and credits have become very scarce. Loan maturities exceeding even a one year range, are currently not available to the Turkish market and financing from the Turkish Eximbank is inadequate.  As a result, MK is requesting a medium-term working capital loan of US$10 million from the IFC to finance an increased volume of sales and inventory over the next few years. Under the circumstances, without the IFC''s investment, MK would be forced to rely on extremely limited, short-term and more expensive financing which would adversely affect its liquidity. Therefore, in the context of the uncertain economic environment and the competitive pressures in the sector, the project critically supports the sustained and competitive evolution of a vital Turkish company.  The project is expected to have the following developmental impacts, which are in line with the IFC''s mission to reduce poverty and improve people''s lives: - support the industrial packaging sector through paper production and further investments in corrugated box manufacturing; - increase exports for both MK and the country;- create employment in the paper plant and related fields, such as waste paper collection and shipping; - increase waste paper recycling and use of non-wood fibers (such as straw);- improve energy efficiency through cogeneration, which will also benefit surrounding enterprises (that buy the excess energy produced by Modern Enerji); and - disseminate modern technologies and advanced know-how in paper-making.","","","","","","","","","","",This is a Category C project according to the IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.

PriceSmart Jamaica,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Jamaica,"Price Ventures, Inc",Regional Industry - MAS LAC,2001-12-20T05:00:00Z,2002-02-15T05:00:00Z,B,Equity,"PriceSmart is constantly seeking new emerging markets where it can develop, own and operate new retail warehouse membership-shopping businesses that leverage existing and local capabilities. In line with this strategy, PSMT has formed a joint-venture to expand its operations by constructing and operating 2 deep-discount, ""no-frills"" membership shopping warehouses in Kingston and Montego Bay, Jamaica.  The 50,000 sq. ft warehouses will follow the successful concept adopted by PSMT in its expansion in Central America, other Caribbean islands, and more recently the Philippines. They will sell a variety of food and consumer goods with an emphasis on quality, low prices, and efficient operations. The warehouses will typically carry a much smaller product range compared to supermarkets (2,500 stock-keeping units (""sku"") vs. 25,000-30,000 sku for supermarkets) including apparel, food services, bakery, photo centers, tire centers, etc.. The target customers will be consumers and small businesses. About 50% of sales will be derived from products sourced from the local market. The shopping format will include an annual membership fee of approximately US$25 with expected annual purchases averaging US$1,250 per member.IFC Role:IFC role is to provide long-term financing not readily available for retail companies in the Caribbean. The project''s requirement for long-term debt with long maturities precludes it from obtaining satisfactory financing from local sources. PSMT''s experiences in the Caribbean and Central America show that the company has not been able to access loans with adequate maturities in these markets. The financial package will meet the project''s needs and strengthen its financial structure.  IFC will also provide environmental oversight to ensure that the project meets World Bank Group guidelines, along with its financing. Development Impact:The project will have a strong development impact by expanding and strengthening the retail industry in Jamaica.  It will provide consumers with lower prices on a wide variety of food and quality consumer goods through increased efficiencies of purchasing, logistics, technology, and distribution. Therefore, the project will, to a great extent, contribute to raising the standard of living for a large portion of the local population. Lower prices to consumers:   PSMTs strategy is to be the high-volume low-cost operation to provide lower prices in the marketplace.  Its goal is to be the ""low-price leader"" for the markets served.  This is achieved by offering a limited range of products in a low-cost, no-frills warehouse type environment.Product Quality Enhancement:  PSMT will source 50% of its products from local sources. To maintain the same high product standards it gets from imported products, the company requires that all its local suppliers meet the same quality standard. This will help uplift quality standards of local suppliers and encourage competitiveness.  The project will also introduce international best practices and bring modern technology by inducing suppliers to adopt bar coding and other sophisticated MIS systemsHigh Quality Job Creation:  PSMT employees will receive higher than average pay and will be trained in product display, modern selling and marketing techniques, inventory control and working in a computerized environment. The project will create nearly 300 direct jobs. A number of indirect jobs will also be created. In addition, significant opportunities exist for training, acquiring merchandising skills, and promotion within the group as PSMT advertises job opportunities for domestic, regional, and international jobs internally and on its website.Ethical Business Practices:  Operating in the formal sector, PSMT employs ethical business practices, pays import taxes and duties, V.A.T, and local and income and taxes. This provides dependable revenue source for the governments.Regional Market Development:  PSMTs operations in the region will link markets in Central America and the Caribbean by providing access to local manufacturers and suppliers in each others markets through the companys buying and retailing network.  In addition, the project has mobilized capital from the region, bringing in Latin American investors.Efficiency of Supply Chain:  A significant number of customers of PSMT warehouses are small retailers who buy in bulk and then resell in their own stores in more remote locations of each country. Developing and increasing this line of business allows PSMT to improve the efficiency of the entire supply chain of a particular country. The benefits of variety, quality, and low cost of products are extended to those who do not live close to the warehouses.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected community Kingston Chamber of Commerce7-8 East ParadeKingston, JamaicaMontego Bay Chamber of Commerce4-7 Overton PlazaMontego Bay, Jamaica","PriceSmart Inc.

Latin America, with its large and developed microfinance sector, offers a unique environment for commercial bank transformations. IFC can contribute its experience with MFIs worldwide and Calpiá could benefit from IFCs burgeoning knowledge in this field. Microfinance schemes have been shown to have a major positive impact in reducing poverty and unemployment in developing countries. In general, the disadvantaged economic sectors in developing countries have limited access, if any, to financing through the traditional financial institutions. This IFC equity investment would allow Calpiá to transform itself from a finance company to a commercial bank.

Metro,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Middle East and North Africa,"Egypt, Arab Republic of",Metro Market,Regional Industry - MAS Africa,2002-01-02T05:00:00Z,2002-02-05T05:00:00Z,B,Loan,"Description of Company: In 1999, the group established Metro Markets, the first Egyptian-owned chain of retail stores. During 1999 and 2000, Metro Markets expanded at a realistic pace, opening 17 operating outlets in Cairo and Alexandria.  All stores are designed following a corporate identity that encompasses fixtures, fittings, signage, layout and shelf stickers.  Individual product prices are identified by bar codes. Each store is pleasantly finished with false ceilings, tiled floors and wide aisles. It has a dedicated security staff (both uniformed and non-uniformed) that routinely keeps a close watch, and it is equipped with fire extinguishers.  The current strategy calls for further expansion in order to capture a larger share of the market, develop synergies with existing stores and achieve economies of scale, and contribute to the development of a formal retail sector in the country. Purpose of Project:   The proposed IFC financing will be in the form of a corporate loan to Metro Markets to finance an investment program in the areas of supermarket retailing (ongoing expansion of Metro Market stores) and dairy foods and juice drinks (modernization of the Siclam plant and efficiency improvements).Development Impact: The proposed investment program is expected to have the following development impacts:Supermarket retailing operations:  (i) impact on the retail sector of the economy : the projects investment in to the expansion of the first Egyptian owned supermarket chain will be an added support to the rapidly growing retail sector and services as a whole.  The project will also help strengthen the retail distribution network in Egypt; (ii) impact on consumers: consumers will benefit from access to an organized retail supermarket with quality products at competitive prices; and (iii) impact on suppliers: the project will have several backward linkages within the economy-- as the supermarket chain develops, more goods will be sourced locally, which will help develop a local supply chain, especially within the agriculture and manufacturing industries.  Manufacturers will be encouraged to produce goods locally which will lead to improvements in the quality of products, as competition increases domestically and with foreign products.Dairy and juice drinks operations:  (i) Impacts on customers:  consumers of dairy and juice products will benefit from the availability of well packaged, nutritious fresh milk produced, at a reasonable price, under strict guidelines of hygiene and food safety; (ii) impacts on suppliers: it is expected that with the establishment of a new plant, Siclams factory will be modernized to world standards. Hence, the availability of such modern, environmentally/hygienically friendly technology in Siclams dairy production will have a spillover effect on competitors and other suppliers of dairy and juice products in Egypt - i.e., environmental standards within the entire dairy industry can be expected to increase as Siclams competitors strive to produce outputs that comply with similar hygiene and food safety standards; (iii) Impacts on farmers:  fresh milk, used in the dairy production process of Siclam, will be collected from 4 centers to which smaller dairy farmers will bring their milk.  This will increase the access of small dairy farmers to an improved and more organized market for their milk, thereby raising overall family incomes.  Another benefit of the projects backward linkages to the micro-dairy farm sector will be the improvement of the quality and hygiene standards of milk produced by dairy farmers in Egypt.IFC has a strong role to play in this project.  First, the provision of long-term financing, which is scarce in Egypt, to allow the company to finance its expansion and modernization programs.  Second, the project would support Egypts only formally-organized local chain of retail outlets (grocery stores) and would create the first private sector integrated dairy plant in the country, thereby contributing to the development of the local private sector. Third, the project would introduce higher environmental and hygiene standards including: appropriate food handling and packaging, suitable transport, storage and display facilities, and training of staff in hygiene and food safety.  It would also ensure a regular supply of consistent products hygienically produced and packaged.  Finally, the project will improve the welfare of remote rural areas by providing small farmers with a constant demand for raw milk and thus a stable source of income. The implementation of four new milk collection centers equipped with milk testing facilities will integrate the small farmers to urban areas and improve the quality of the milk collected.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines, or design criteria.

For Metro Markets stores, site selection is based on predetermined criteria such as neighborhood population, accessibility, income levels, likely customer profile, serviceability, competition, and availability of utilities and good infrastructure around the new stores. The sites contemplated for the proposed expansion have all been evaluated so as to meet the above criteria. Typically, Metro Markets stores are in urban locations.  Store sizes and layouts vary depending on the characteristics of the building.  Siclam:  The Siclam plant is located in Alexandria, Egypts second largest city, on the Mediterranean coast at almost 200 km north of Cairo. The site is on a 5-hectare plot with adequate space for future expansion.  In the immediate vicinity there is a mixture of housing, light industry and commercial buildings.

IFC''s investment will thus restore the companys liquidity and enable it to increase exports in direct support of the Turkish economy. Moreover, the project gives IFC an opportunity to support a company belonging to an existing client (Eczacibasi Group) in one of its major business segments at a critical time for the Turkish economy.World Bank Group Strategy:  The World Bank Group and IMF have focused recent efforts on helping Turkey cope with its financial crisis through continuing adjustment lending, support of structural reforms and fiscal stabilization.  This project is consistent with both World Bank strategy and with IFC''s country strategy for Turkey, which seeks to: restore stable growth, improve living standards, reduce economic vulnerability and poverty, and aid the private sector to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the reform.  By reinforcing the financial structure of an export-oriented company, IFC supports an inflow of foreign currency earnings for Turkey while providing a positive image for quality-based Turkish exports.  Such a role figures prominently during recessionary periods such as 1999, when the overall value of Turkish exports declined.  In addition, by supporting a leading outward looking, regionally-oriented company, IFC fosters the transfer of first-class production methods, strong environmental, health and management systems.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityThe environmental documentation (ERS) will be posted on the notice board at the entrances of the two plants in Bozoyuk and in Tuzla.","Eczacibasi Karo Seramik A.S.

The project is envisaged to be a mixed use facility incorporating office and commercial developments and an IT school building.   It aims to provide an environment in which the technology infrastructure is state-of-the-art and companies have the facilities to conduct business efficiently.  The funds will be used to finance the construction of the IT school, the IT infrastructure and 3 IT buildings.IFC Role:Improving Governance. It is likely that IFCs support for this project will result in an improvement in the sponsors corporate governance practices through covenants in the IFC loan.Providing long-term financing.  Under the present circumstances, Philippine corporations find it extremely difficult to secure long-term financing, as local banks are unable and foreign banks are reluctant to provide it. Though Megaworld would probably be able to proceed with the project in the absence of IFC financing, it would have to do so by obtaining much shorter term financing locally. Critical mass. The rationale for supporting a second technology park in the country lies in the competitive advantage of the Philippines in the IT services area. Building up a critical mass is crucial for the realization of this potential.Development Impact:Export Potential. The project is likely to play an important role in strengthening the Philippines capacity to export IT-enabled services thus diversifying the countrys export base.

The companies are:Company		Products	- Atos 		Phyto-pharmaceuticals and health 					products production and marketing.			- Libra Organic	Organic fresh fruit, vegetables and herbs processing.		- Hator		Packaging and marketing 		Libra Organic products.				- Conytex		Manufacture of organic textiles.        			- Sekem		Organic herbs and spices processing.			- Isis		Organic foodstuff and herbal teas.				The group has approached IFC for a corporate loan to implement an expansion, re-organization and financial restructuring plan encompassing four of the above-mentioned companies.  This project would be IFCs first investment in the phyto-pharmaceutical sector.  The entire cultivation is achieved using  bio-dynamic methods.  Based on the premise that organic cultivation does not produce any unusable waste, all products of the system can be either sold or re-used in cultivation, thereby creating a sustainable process.  The group also exemplifies the view that profit making can go hand-in-hand with an integrated socioeconomic business model, providing employees and suppliers with assistance in developing the educational, social, and health aspects of their lives.Impact on labor:  Although the project has limited direct impact on job creation (possibly up to 200 additional jobs), it is expected to have a considerable indirect impact on employment generation in the agriculture sector.  Seven hundred and fifty farm holdings are expected be members of the Egyptian Bio-dynamic Association (EBDA), of which almost 400 will be supplying products to Sekem.  Assuming around a 30% increase in the number of farms joining the EBDA in the future, with Sekems expansion, an additional 120 farms will become direct suppliers to Sekem.  This will result in significant employment creation in the agriculture sector, especially for women, as well as in other sectors in the supply chain (e.g., processing, packaging, transportation, storage etc.).  In addition, the direct employees of Sekem, especially women and working mothers, will benefit from very favorable labor conditions and non-wage benefits (e.g., paid maternity leave, non-exposure to hazardous work,  flexible work hours for mothers with young children, schooling benefits/vocational training for children of employees and households in the neighboring rural areas, medical benefits etc.).Impact on suppliers: The project will result in a transfer of technology and bio-dynamic farming methods across different levels: (i) from Sekem to supplying farm holdings; (ii) from international Demeter certification, to Sekem; and (iii) from Sekem to farm holdings in other parts of the world.Impact on customers: Egyptian consumers will benefit from the project as they will have greater access to (i) phyto-pharmaceutical products derived from organically grown components, (ii) organic fruits and vegetables and organic herbs and spices.  In addition, part of Sekems marketing strategy is an effort to enhance awareness amongst consumers on the benefits of organically grown food products and phyto-pharmaceuticals.Impact on the overall economy: Pharmaceutical products and cotton textiles are import export commodities in Egypt, and Sekems expansion will contribute to improving Egypts export performance and foreign exchange earnings. IFC Role: The group has already approached local banks unsuccessfully for long-term financing of its expansion and restructuring.  IFC can therefore provide much-needed term funds.  IFC''s advice on corporate governance will assist the group in improving the effectiveness of its organizational and management structure, and in formulating an investment policy that will enable it to achieve both its profitability and its social objectives.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected community- Sekem head office in Heliopolis, Cairo (at the address below); - Entrance to the Sekem farm and processing facilities in Belbeis, a small town 60 km north-east of Cairo; andBelbeis Public Library.","The project is sponsored by the family of the founder of Sekem Holding (Sekem or the group), Dr. Ibrahim Abouleish, which, after financial restructuring, will own 95% of the outstanding shares, with small proportions of shares being held by its associates and employees.

With an installed annual capacity of 530,000 tons, MEREN is designed to manufacture a number of different quality products, including dried and milled silica for glass, ceramics, sodium silicate, glass fiber, oil and gas fracturing and other industries that use high quality silica sand. The proposed project will promote healthy local enterprise in the silica sand sector, an industry in which Jordan has a natural advantage. It will directly create approximately 30 jobs in the silica sand factory, and indirectly up to an estimated 350 jobs in the transport, storage and handling, and mining sectors.  Since all MERENs production will initially be for exports, the proposed project will increase Jordans export performance and foreign currency earnings. In the longer-term, it may also stimulate establishment of new downstream industries in Jordan such as glass or ceramics manufacturing that use high quality silica sand.

It also provides graduate degrees to 74 students in engineering and management. Atilim wants to become a top-ranked research institution helping students develop market-needed competencies in engineering and business.  Upon completion of its long-term investment program by the year 2010, the university expects to have three additional faculties: law, fine arts, and communications, a broader science faculty with five additional departments in the faculty of arts and sciences, and two new engineering departments. The engineering faculty will be the largest, followed by the faculty of management. Eventually, about 10% of the total 10,500 students will be enrolled in graduate programs. The project will increase enrollment in Atilim by about 1,300 students. It will add 15,000 m2 of indoor space dedicated to classrooms and laboratories for the faculties of management and engineering. In addition, this phase will include the construction of a waste water treatment facility and a power generation and distribution facility.  Development impact: The project will help augment the delivery of quality tertiary education in Turkey and alleviate the shortage of slots in Turkish universities. With the expansion, Atilim University will begin to achieve sufficient scale to increase its research activities. The successful implementation of the project will encourage other private initiatives in tertiary education and diffuse best management and academic practices to the public and private education system.  IFC''s role: Turkeys financial sector has been unable to provide adequate local currency financing to support long-term investments, especially for not-for-profit institutions such as Atilim.  Financing for these institutions is limited to short-term loans at high spreads or leasing, because they are considered frontier sectors and risk assessment is complicated by their not-for-profit status.  Yet they provide important social services that are directly linked to improving the social capital of the country.  Consequently, the role of IFC is especially important, as it is the only major source of long-term project financing for these clients.  With this investment in a young private university in Turkey, IFC would demonstrate the financial viability of these institutions, structuring innovate ways for securing its loan, while applying some governance measures commonly found in well-managed private institutions.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project, according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

The bank was subsequently converted into an institution specializing in financing small businesses, and started operations with this new focus in late 1998. KMB makes loans to privately-owned micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and provides a range of other financial service.  Its lending activity has a regional focus, and future plans include expansion in the Urals, Siberia, and the European part of Russia. Development impactGiven the focus of KMB''s business plan on regional expansion and the SME sector, by helping the bank maintain its rapid growth trend, IFC will be supporting the development of the key business sector in Russia, especially in areas that are away from the better-banked Moscow region.  The development impact of the project is expected to be threefold: (i) supporting expansion of the SME sector which in Russia is still underdeveloped compared with other countries in Central and Eastern Europe; (ii) regional development, as KMB will emphasize expansion outside the better-banked Moscow and St. Petersburg regions; and (iii) financial sector development, by contributing to the growth of banking services aimed at SMEs, and hopefully serving as a demonstration model to other banks that are considering moving into the sector. IFCs RoleCurrently, there are virtually no commercial sources of long-term funding for banks in Russia unless they belong to one of the big financial/industrial groups.  KMB''s access to funding from existing sources (primarily EBRD) has been exhausted and its deposit base is still small, short term, and it will take considerable time and effort to develop into a reliable source of funding.  At the same time, funding on the inter-bank market is very short-term and expensive. IFC financing will provide resources which are essential for KMB to expand its lending activities and to broaden the range of its services by making larger loans to serve its best SME customers, in addition to micro-enterprises and to increase profitability.

In 1988 the company diversified into tourist resorts, which now dominate VSTC''s operations.  The company, with US$ 108.4 million in total assets and a net worth of US$ 60.9 million as of June 30, 2001, is one of the larger private companies in the Maldives.Having received land for storage purposes from the government of Maldives, VSTC is now expanding its trading operations by implementing storage facilities at Thilafushi island. VSTC also intends to make its resorts world class by improving environment compliance and safety facilities. VSTC corporate investment program consisting of :i) Infrastructure for Trading Operations (US$23.2 million) including installing storage tanks for diesel, kerosene and petrol (38,000 cubic meters), LPG storage and filling plant (2,538 MT), and cement storage silos and packaging plant (8,000 MT).ii) Energy Saving Equipment (US$4.3 million)  including solar water heating systems, heat recovery systems and rationalisation of the installed power generating capacity. These systems would reduce energy consumption by 10-20%, resulting in savings of about US$0.65 million per annum.iii) Environment and Safety Infrastructure (US$3.8 million)  including fire detection and safety systems, exhaust chimney systems, and waste water treatment plants. iv) Debt Restructuring of up to US$ 9.5 million of short-term debt.IFC RoleIFC would provide long term funding for the proposed project which is not available in the Maldives.  The banks operating in the Maldives restrict funding to 3-4 years and offer small amounts at high fixed interest rates of 12% - 14% p.a. in US$ terms.  Resort owners have to rely mainly on financing arrangements with tour operators, which have high hidden interest costs of 20% - 30% p.a.  IFC would help the company to demonstrate its commitment to protecting the local environment and improving its own environment and safety infrastructure.  The Sun Island, partly funded by an IFC loan, has demonstrated good environmental performance (being the first winner of the ""Presidential Green Globe Award"" in the Maldives) and the current investment is expected to bring the other resorts to similar standards of compliance.

The proposed upgrade of VSTC''s environmental and safety facilities and implementation of energy saving measures, will further yield quantifiable and non-quantifiable economic benefits.The expansion of VSTC''s trading activities increases the choices available to the Maldivian consumer and leads to more efficient delivery and market linked prices of essentials goods such as diesel, LPG and cement.

In order to finance its activities and continued growth, CNO borrowed US$280 million, through a financial structure maturing in June and July 2002 . Due to the political uncertainty in Brazil, the recent crisis in Argentina, and the terrorist attacks to the USA, the international financial market has been adversely affected. It is in this context the company has requested IFCs assistance in mobilizing US$280 million for the financing of its future operations (the project).IFC Role	IFC''s role in this project includes: (i) providing financing that is otherwise currently not available; (ii) ""bailing-in"" other private sector financing sources through its B-loan mobilization program; (iii) advising the company on a more rational and sustainable financing structure and financial management through appraisal; and (iv) contributing in the improvement of corporate governance practices.Development ImpactThe Brazilian private sector at present is faced with multiple threats to its stability and prospects of future growth: the depreciation of the Real; the current political and economical uncertainty in Argentina; the political anxiety prior to the 2002 presidential election; the world economic slowdown; and the flight to quality since the September 11 event.  These factors are seriously affecting Brazilian firms ability to raise financing necessary to maintain the normal course of business, let alone to invest for future growth.  Even large companies that previously had access to market financing have lost access.  Under the circumstances, demand for financing support from institutions like IFC is mounting and pressing.  This requires IFC in the short-run to narrow its focus towards responding to such urgent demand, while remaining within the framework for its medium-term objectives. In relation to this project, the borrower has agreed to earmark US$1 million to finance a social project, acceptable to IFC.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communitySalvador Head OfficeAvenida Luiz Vianna Filho, 2841 - ParalelaEdifício Odebrecht - Núcleo da Memória41.730 - 900 -Salvador - BAPhone: 0 xx  71 206 1111Fax: 0 xx 71 206 0701Rio de Janeiro Engineering OfficeDiretor de Relações Institucionais - Roberto DiasConstrutora Norberto OdebrechtPraia de Botafogo, 300 - 11o. andarBotafogo22.250 - 040 - Rio de Janeiro - RJPhone: 0 xx 21 2559 3723Fax: 0 xx 21 2552 4448São Paulo Engineering OfficeConstrutora Norberto OdebrechtPrograma de Meio Ambiente - Sergio LeãoAvenida das Nações 4.777 - 5o. andarEdifício Villa Lobos - 6o. andarAlto de Pinheiros05477 - 000 - São Paulo - SPPhone: 0 xx 11 3443 9316Fax: 0 xx 11 3443 931Internet site of the ""Sindicato Nacional da Construção Civil - SINICON"" - www.sinicon.com.br Internet site of Odebrecht at www.odebrecht.com.br","Odebrecht S.A (ODB) is one of the ten largest Brazilian private-sector conglomerates in terms of revenues, and Brazils leading service exporter.

Following the renaming of TyP to France Telecom Dominicana, France Telecom transferred its entire stake in TyP to Orange S.A.  As of November 2001, FTD had over 220,000 customers and a network that covers approximately 95% of the country''s population.The Dominican Republic telecommunications market is currently characterized by low national penetration rates and long wait lists for fixed lines.

Leasing will introduce a viable alternative to loans for the smaller enterprises without the need for compliance with extensive collateral requirements.

The proposed project will be the third project with the company. The first investment was approved in 1990 and it involved an A loan of US$24 million, a B loan of US$27.5 million, and an equity of US$4 million. The hotel''s opening in 1992 coincided with depressed market conditions, resulting from the effects of the Gulf war, and strong growth in the number of five-stars capacity, therefore the project was restructured in 1993 when the Board approved an additional US$6.5 million (A loan of US$3 million and B loan of US$3.5 million).  Since the restructuring, Conrad Hotel has showed sound operations and has demonstrated its viability.  Today, all B-loans have been repaid (in 1998) and in 1998 IFC has sold its equity share to a local sponsor: Aksoy Group.  As of March 2002, IFC''s exposure decreased to US$8.3 million.  The proposed investment includes a mid-size conference center and a room/accommodation refurbishment program, which is expected: i) to improve Conrads competitive position for mid-size conferences;  ii) to lead to better utilization of previously dormant and wasted space, converting it into revenue generating property; and iii) to provide higher margins and occupancy rates, thus making the hotel less prone to seasonality.  The business/conference segment of the tourism industry provides good prospects for higher occupancy rates.  After this investment, Conrad will be better able to face its competitors by providing conference facilities and high level of standards rooms. The project will not increase the 667 room-capacity of the hotel.IFC Role: After the recent political and macro economical turmoil, interest rates in Turkey have skyrocketed, and credits have become very scarce.  More importantly, local financial institutions do not provide the financial depth required for the long-term, outward looking strategic development of major corporations in Turkey.  Loan maturities, exceeding even a one year range, are currently not available to the Turkish market.  Without IFCs investment, the company would be forced to rely on extremely limited, short-term, and more expensive financing which would adversely affect liquidity.  In the context of the uncertain economic environment, the project critically supports the sustained and competitive evolution of the tourism industry, a vital sector for Turkish economy, where total revenues of more than US$8 billion were earned in 2001.  World Bank Group Strategy: The World Bank Group and IMF have focused recent efforts on helping Turkey cope with its financial crisis through continuing adjustment lending, support of structural reforms,0 and fiscal stabilization.  This project is consistent with both World Bank strategy and with IFC''s country strategy for Turkey, which seeks to: restore stable growth, improve living standards, reduce economic vulnerability and poverty, and aid the private sector to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the reform.  By reinforcing the financial structure of an export-earning  company, IFC supports an inflow of foreign currency earnings for Turkey. Development Impact: The proposed project will have a significant development impact.  IFCs support of the project is critical at a time when higher inflation, shrinking domestic demand, and price increases have stagnated the economy, especially manufacturing sector, which has brought about massive layoffs, causing severe economic and social instability in the country.  The hotel is internationally competitive and has provided export-earnings in the range of US$21 to US$31 million in the past few years.  It employs some 400 staff. By providing timely financing, IFC will help the company seize the market opportunity, and adapt to the latest market requirements. It will also enable the hotel to diversify its income base since the business/conference segment of the tourism industry is less prone to seasonality and regional events.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityA copy of the environmental documents (translated into Turkish) will be posted on the notice board at the staff entrance of the hotel.","The major shareholder of Conrad Hotel (Conrad, or the hotel), holding a 49% stake, is  Aksoy Group: a Turkish family owned enterprise involved in the construction, real estate and petroleum distribution business.

Over time as FFC expands, other food and agribusiness companies are also expected to participate in the FFC, increasing the number of farms serviced. The FFC is an innovative structure which makes it possible to finance primary agriculture because it relies on long-term supply contracts between suppliers/farms and technically and financially strong processing industries. This tightly integrated supply chain provides sufficient comfort to attract investors and makes it possible to finance primary agricultural production.

New investment in essential farm equipment, like cooling tanks for milk, together with technical assistance, will enable these enterprises to improve  efficiency in the production, distribution and the quality of raw milk.  The project will facilitate the transfer of efficiency-enhancing technologies and business management techniques.  Indirect developmental effects are also significant since investment in these enterprises will have a significant multiplier effect on downstream processors, which are severely constrained by the quality and quantity of raw milk. This will foster the development of processing enterprises that will benefit from a high quality and secure supply of raw milk.    Poverty Alleviation : Farmers'' standards of living and employment.  The expansion of the production capacity is likely to entail a net positive effect on employment and incomes.  This effect is particularly welcome in a sector like agriculture that experienced a deep contraction in the 1990s, and in regions which have suffered from high unemployment and poverty. Product safety compliance: technical assistance in the use and maintenance of the equipment, milk handling and hygiene will bring a cleaner, more hygienic product to the processing factory and the consumer market. Foreign exchange earnings:  The project will expand the domestic production of products, and thereby reduce  the need to import; and will help over time to lower the demand for foreign exchange.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a category FI Type 2 project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedure.

Mahindra Farm Services,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,South Asia,India,MAHINDRA AGRI SOLUTIONS LIMITED,Regional Industry - MAS Asia & Pac,2002-04-04T05:00:00Z,2002-05-29T04:00:00Z,B,Equity,"Each ASC system will consist of the hub ASC and a number of related kiosks (spokes).  Each ASC will be able to provide farmers with: (i) appropriate inputs (seeds, fertilizers, chemicals); (ii) rental equipment; (iii) information (agronomic practices, market information); (iv) contractual farm-input-application and advisory services, and (v) access to crop finance from commercial banks all under a one-stop-shop concept. Each ASC will be staffed with qualified and suitably trained personnel who will transfer knowledge of good agricultural practices to farmers.Developmental Impact:The objective of MSSLs business model is to improve farming profitability and sustainability by increasing agricultural yields, reducing production costs and chemical pest control dependency. Current less-than-optimal production in India is attributable to the failure to integrate quality agriculture inputs, scientific farming techniques, mechanization, and finance. Indian farmers often do not trust existing input distribution channels because of the prevalence of poor business practices and spurious products. The public extension systems reach is limited and the contribution of the private sector is typically motivated by the sale of specific products. MSSLs intention is to become an agent for change in Indian agriculture through an integrated approach that will provide unbiased solutions oriented to individual farmer success.  Moreover, the project will benefit the health and well being of farmers and the environment by promoting integrated pest management (IPM) and non-chemical methods and informed management of chemical products.   Farmers will be able to access better and more appropriate and fair priced inputs, rental equipment, and extension services as well as assistance in marketing the crops through market information and brokerage services. Farmers will also have access to crop loans from  commercial banks at reasonable interest rates enabling investment in modern agricultural techniques and migration to higher value crops. These benefits are likely to spread to non-participating farmers as they will observe the yield improvement and will consequently modify their own crop management techniques. The project is also expected to generate a substantial number of new jobs in rural areas. The venture is expected to cover 180 districts in India creating jobs for rural residents in the areas of agricultural extension, retailing, logistics, and farm equipment operations.  In almost all cases the local agricultural service center will employ staff and contractor from the vicinity of the project.  IFC''s role IFC''s involvement in the project will assist the company to: (i) enhance its credibility for the expansion of the franchise and client base, (ii) help promote Integrated Pesticide Management plans to reduce the reliance on chemicals and use chemicals only when they are required; and (iii) gain from IFC knowledge/sources on global agri-trends and insights on successful agri-projects across the globe.

The Investment program comprises two phases of which phase one, completed in August 2001, involves the construction of a new milk powder plant. Phase two consists of the creation of a new industrial complex in the outskirts of Montevideo.The project is a key component of a long-range modernization program initiated by the cooperative in 1999 to transform itself into a modern, low cost and world competitive dairy company, in order to survive in the midst of heightened competition and position itself as one of the leading regional dairy players in the medium-term. Significant progress have been achieved over the last three years to that end, through consolidation of manufacturing activities; upgrade of manufacturing processes; adoption of best practices; innovative IT solutions, and improvement of governance practices to become more efficient and proactive with the market. The next major step in this program, the project, will allow the cooperative to achieve significant efficiency gains and realize large cost savings by relocating the production of value added products from two old plants in Montevideo to a new state of the art facility located in the outskirts of the city and two other existing sites where synergies can be achieved. These operations are currently inefficient due to the plants'' antiquated layout, limited automation and low productivity, logistic bottlenecks, and duplication of specialized lines and distribution centers across several sites. IFC will help the cooperative undertake this critical project, by providing it with long-term financing with a tenor that would not otherwise be available from commercial banks. Given the regional economic situation, IFC''s involvement will also provide comfort to the company''s local and international short-term lenders for participating in the restructuring of the company''s short-term debt into long-term debt, thereby reducing refinancing risks. Furthermore, IFC will support the cooperative''s initiatives to improve its corporate governance practices and provide its newly created environment division assistance for institutionalizing environmental best practice standards.The project is expected to have a strong developmental impact given the cooperative''s central role in Uruguay''s dairy sector. It will strengthen the competitiveness of the cooperative in a sector where Uruguay has a strong comparative advantage.  By placing the cooperative on sounder operational and financial footings to meet the challenges of an increasingly competitive international market, it will directly benefit the 2,650 farmers supplying milk to the company by increasing the overall efficiency and viability of the dairy sector and enhancing their revenues in the long-term. It will also have a very positive environmental impact including improved effluent quality and reduced environmental nuisances for the inhabitants of Montevideo.

The company was set up in 1998 following the merger of Globo Cabo''s operations and those of Multicanal S.A.  Its network now passes 6.5 million homes and has 1.44 million subscribers (25% penetration).   Its management and operations are first class.  The company is the market leader in Brazil with a 43% market share.  It has very strong content, and is now also offering broadband cable modem services and corporate network data transmission services (fiber optic, coaxial cable and wireless solutions to transmit voice, data and video) to a variety of market segments, including small and medium enterprises.  Additional telecommunication services may also be added in due course.Today, the company is the result of a number of mergers and acquisitions involving other companies in the sector.  Over the past several years, GC and the companies it acquired borrowed heavily to finance network capital expenditures, subscriber acquisition costs and other costs associated with a start-up operation in this sector.  A significant portion of those borrowings were in USD which has added to the burden of this debt load.  The project is a recapitalization involving raising new equity capital and lengthening debt maturities.   With the major shift in the view of the global capital markets towards this type of business, from an oversupply of capital to an undersupply, many companies have found themselves without the ability to refinance maturing debt.  In the case of Globo Cabo, this global trend has been accentuated by a general reluctance to lend into or invest in emerging markets and the slowdown in the Brazilian economy occasioned by the Brazilian energy crisis and some measure of contagion from Argentina.  IFC''s role in this project would be to allow the company to extend debt maturities and access significant amounts of local currency funding at a time when that might otherwise be difficult.This would be the first partial credit guarantee used in the Brazilian bond market.

The project is an 870 MW ""quasi"" merchant natural gas-fired power plant.  It is being developed under the Priority Thermal Power Program launched in 2000 by the government of Brazil.  As such, the Macaé plant will help to underpin the governments objective to more optimally balance Brazils sources of energy supply by increasing thermal generation capacity, thereby reducing the country''s reliance on hydropower.  The project will provide reliable and flexible thermal power to the Southeast region of Brazil, one of the areas heavily impacted by the recent energy crisis.  Due to the flexibility of the plant''s technology and fuel supply arrangements, the Macaé plant is one of the few thermal power plants in Brazil which is able to flexibly respond to the country''s power needs.

BOPP film is primarily used for food and confectionary packaging, lamination, adhesive tapes, pharmaceutical packs, and capacitor film.  In FY97-99,  to emerge from a domestic BOPP overcapacity situation, Cosmo capitalised on a diversification into exports of niche products to achieve full capacity utilization and a strong recovery of profitability in FY00.  In September 2001, because of the continuing growth in domestic demand, facing capacity constraints, Cosmo commissioned a 9,000 tpa production line (Line IV), and,  in October 2001, it acquired GP.  GP was one of Cosmo''s leading domestic competitors with a production capacity of 13,500 tpa, but, in FY99, it had lost profitability, due to high leverage with expensive debt, which Cosmo now proposes to restructure.  Together with the financial restructuring of the recently acquired GP, the proposed project also aims at adding a new 10,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) production line (Line V) . Line V will increase Cosmo''s BOPP capacity from 23,100 tpa to 33,100 tpa.  The line, together with the merger with GP, will take Cosmo''s BOPP capacity to 46,600 tpa.   The proposed investment will enable Cosmo to consolidate its position in the rapidly growing domestic BOPP market, while serving export markets for niche high-end BOPP applications. The capacity expansion will be at Cosmos existing facilities at Aurangabad, Maharashtra, where surplus land, support infrastructure and trained manpower are already available.  Cosmo has ISO9001 and ISO9002 certifications, and holds the patent for synthetic paper.  The company has a credit rating of ''A'' from Fitch India as of FY01. From being a second-tier company in the domestic BOPP industry, Cosmo is now graduating to become the dominant domestic player, also serving international niche markets.  IFC would play a strong role in supporting Cosmo''s strategy by providing long-term foreign currency financing, which is not readily available, to medium sized companies like Cosmo for maturities beyond three years.  This financial support will enable the company to better withstand the natural cyclicality of the industry.  IFC would also play a key role in assessing and providing advisory support to Cosmo on its merger with the recently acquired GP operations.  The acquisition of GP is the first such endeavor undertaken by Cosmo, and the company expects a strong value-addition from the presence of IFC in developing a sound implementation plan for merging GP''s operations and its financial restructuring.The Indian BOPP industry is gradually maturing, and the project will support the dominant player to lead the restructuring process in that industry.  Most Indian BOPP manufacturers are diversified companies that entered the market when the demand and price scenarios in the industry were favorable, and the incentives to set up internationally competitive and benchmarked operations of economic size were limited.  This situation is quickly evolving with margins coming under pressure as a result of domestic competition, economies of scale, and periods of excess supply as lumpy production capacities come on stream.  Similar to other countries, the industry is gradually consolidating to fewer, larger and more efficient players as the less efficient and competitive exit the industry.  Companies that take the initiative to proactively benchmark themselves with global standards can create strong value in the economy through demonstration, leadership and creation of viable revenue generating assets.  Cosmo has the capability to lead the way in upgrading the entire industry in terms of quality, R&D, productivity and focused customer support.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityThe company''s bulletin boards located at its factory sites in :1.

One of its major priorities is to provide support to the development of the local small and medium sized businesses (SMEs).  The bank provides SMEs  all over the country access to banking resources and has established a strong franchise in this market.  Unionbank''s loan portfolio as of year-end 2001 amounted to BGN 47 million (US$21 million equivalent) and is concentrated in the trade and manufacturing sectors. The bank is well capitalized with capital of BGN 30 million (US$14 million equivalent) and assets of BGN 122 million (US$55 million equivalent).  The project involves the extension of a credit line to Unionbank  to help extend the maturity of the bank''s funding base.  The credit line will be used as a source of medium term funding for the development of small business finance activities.  Bulgarias future economic growth will continue to be driven by the emerging SME sector which, according to government sources, already accounts for more than 50% of GDP.  Nevertheless, Bulgarian bank lending is heavily concentrated towards the large corporate and public sectors.  Small business lending has not been a feature of the banking business; this sector of the economy is underserved, and the availability of term finance for SMEs is scarce.   This facility critically addresses this gap.   The project is consistent with the World Bank Groups strategy of improving the efficiency of financial intermediation and in supporting the Bulgarian private sector.

The specialized steel products manufactured by Usha Beltron are high value added niche products which are often made to customer specifications through labor intensive processes.  In order to become more cost competitive, the company has undertaken a series of vertical integration projects and in the next phase, it proposes a project for: (i) adding a 7.5 MW waste heat recovery based captive power plant; (ii) setting up a direct reduced iron (DRI) plant to manufacture sponge iron (the main raw material); and (iii) setting up facilities for manufacturing more value-added products in wires and strands, and bright bars.  The DRI and the captive power plants are likely to lead to significant cost savings.

The group has over 10 subsidiary companies and 19 bottling plants in the Southern and Eastern Africa region.  The group has already invested more than US$100 million in production facilities in East Africa and Mozambique and employs approximately 8,000 people in 7 countries. It also supports a network of SMEs and other businesses which supplies with goods and services so that the multiplier effect is strong. The project consists of the expansion of soft-drinks production and distribution facilities at the CCS bottling companies. The expansions will take place mostly at existing plants, although, CCS is likely to acquire some existing bottling companies over the next year or two, which will also be re-equipped and expanded. CCS wants to reach an agreement with IFC on a master facility between IFC and CCS that can be drawn down as each of the sub-projects is implemented.  The project will have a sustainable development impact and will help reduce poverty through the expansion of the number of jobs and business opportunities created by Coca-Cola''s production and distribution networks in Africa.  A number of the subsidiaries are joint ventures with local partners who play important operational roles. For example, in South Africa, CCS recently formed a joint venture with Fortune Beverages to enhance the empowerment impact of its operations. CCS is a group which shows strong social responsibility through its support for a wide range of community action projects (eg. road safety, environmental clean-ups, conservation), HIV/AIDS education and health campaigns, youth sports and financial support for schools, and other social services.IFC''s role in the project will be: (a) to provide equity, long term loans and/or guarantees in countries where it is difficult to raise appropriate funds; (b) to help alleviate the relatively high risk associated with the countries where the investment is required by providing informal political risk cover; and (c) to encourage regional integration by helping to make it easier for the South African parent to invest regionally.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityKenyaCoca Cola Holdings LtdAddis Ababa RoadIndustrial AreaNairobi (fax 254 2 542712)International Finance CorporationHill Park BuildingUpper HillNairobi (fax 254 2  260383)EthiopiaEast African Bottling Pvt.

The bank has maintained high growth, profitability, and portfolio quality since its inception four years ago. As a result, it was able to double its capital base in less than three years. Given domestic resource constraints for funding for its core business and increased competition among the banks for resources, Exim Bank is planning to adapt a strategy of diversifying its funding sources and mix, including mobilizing further domestic deposits, public equity in the near term, and raising funding from international financial institutions such as IFC and others active in the region.

IFCs funds would enable the bank to expand its operations in much needed areas of financing: namely, Tanzanias economic back-bone, crop exports. If IFC were to play a role in Tanzania''s economy and financial sector, Exim Bank is a good route.  Furthermore, the financing would help Exim bank enhance/strengthen its capital base; diversify its shareholding structure before public listing, and expand its growing portfolio.  IFC will also support Exim Bank''s efforts to mobilize additional resources from other lenders in the region.IFC has three roles in this project: (1) developmental role: by supporting a sector that generates the highest employment and contributes close to 55% of the GDP, IFC is playing a modest role in supporting the growth of a key economic sector; (2) institutional building:  by enhancing the capital base and funding capacity of an emerging export oriented bank, IFC will continue to play a role in the development of Tanzania''s private banking industry.

In 2001, UBCI was incorporated in Panama as a financial holding company in order to consolidate the shares of the group''s three banking and financial enterprises in the region. UBCI''s shares will soon be listed in the Costa Rican stock market through a US$7.5 million IPO. With close to US$3 billion in consolidated assets, and over US$200 billion in consolidated book equity, the group is harnessing existing synergies in information technology, regional delivery, funding and sharing of best practices in order to position itself for rapid growth within the region.In a region where the average bank has less than US$20 million in equity and makes less than US$2 million in net income, the regional play deployed by Cuscatlan will generate considerable economies of scale and bring affordable banking solutions to Central American clients.  Empirical evidence has firmly established a causal link running from financial system depth and soundness to economic growth, and from economic growth to poverty reduction; hence the strong developmental appeal of the Cuscatlan''s regional integration. Overall, by sharing best practices, the group will leverage the more advanced banking regulation in force in El Salvador, as well as the leading environmental practices that Banco Cuscatlan de El Salvador has developed with IFC''s assistance. Also, the UBCI listing will contribute to the deepening of the financial markets in the region.  As IFC''s quasi-equity financing is expected to be counted as tier-2 capital, IFC would, by way of this investment, provide critical support to the conglomerate''s growth in the Central American region. IFC funds would enable the group to considerably improve capital ratios, reduce maturity mismatches and enhance environmental as well as financial management, everywhere in the group. Moreover, through its participation, IFC would be able to share with the group best practices and leading edge technology developed in the fields of corporate governance and compliance, contributing to the group''s reputation as a model in the region.

The unsettled economic environment is preventing AGD from raising the required pre-export financing lines to complete its planned purchasing program of 4 million tons of oilseeds in 2002.  This is at a time when the oilseeds sector expects a record crop, and soybean crushing margins are at 10 year highs.  IFC''s Role: IFC is assisting a long-standing client and one of Argentina''s top five exporters to access pre-export financing during one of Argentina''s worst economic crises.  AGD''s direct competitors are international traders who are able to fund their activities on international markets and remain largely isolated from the Argentine crisis.  Syndicate banks have indicated that they would only participate if coming through the B Loan umbrella.

It was formed in October 2000 by the merger of the barge operations of Ultrapetrol and the operations of American Commercial Lines LLC, one of the largest US river shipping companies. The project consists of the expansion of UABL''s (or, the company) river barge and terminal operations on the Hidrovia.  Though its size is equivalent to the Mississippi River, it suffers from a lack of infrastructure, and its potential is only beginning to be tapped.  The Hidrovia is used for transporting petroleum products northward to upstream destinations in Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, and Brazil, and for movement of dry cargo (including soy, industrial commodities such as limestone, and forest products) downriver where transfers to ocean-going vessels can be made for export.  Efficient regional transport services and links to the oceangoing shipping lines are important to making the best use of the region''s rich and diverse agricultural and natural resources. Without efficient regional transport services, the agricultural activities in the region would begin to stagnate.This project finances infrastructure that improves competitiveness of exports.  IFC''s strategy emphasizes transport and logistics projects in less developed areas (like the region adjacent to this river system) which help to realize the potential of investments in the region.  Due to the recent financial and economic crisis in Argentina, the availability of financing for infrastructure projects in this region is very limited.  In this context, IFC will provide financing at a tenor and interest rate which is essential for this project but not available from other sources.  IFC will play a key role in creating an appropriate financial structure for the project.  Barges and ships are particularly effective as carriers of bulk goods such as agricultural commodities and industrial raw materials, which constitute the majority of the cargo transported by UABL, and are needed to support the regional industry.  Lowering transportation costs will make the regional industry more competitive in world markets, spur the economic growth of the region, and serve as a catalyst for creating additional employment in the region.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityLocations for the release of the ERS include: Buenos Aires, Parana, Corrientes, Encarnacion, Ciudad del Este, Asuncion, and Puerto Aguirre.

Beko''s product range focuses on conventional televisions, but also includes flat screen TVs, set top boxes, PCs, monitors, DVDs, cash registers, and audio equipment.  The US$95 million proposed project consists of (i) a phased capital investment program of US$30 million, aimed primarily at a 100% expansion of TV manufacturing capacity, in line with long-term OEM export contracts recently secured; (ii) increased working capital requirements of approximately US$50 million, and (iii) US$15 million in short-term debt restructuring in order to improve the overall debt profile of the company.  Development Impacts:Sustainable Employment - Support of the company''s expansion efforts may serve to counteract the employment pressures observed during the deep economic contraction of 2001.  As a result of the expansion, and in spite of the company''s continuing focus on improved productivity, total headcount is expected to increase from 1,828 to 2,817.  The company further supports indirect labor employment through forward and backward linkages, related to outsourced components, transport, and sales.  Beko outsources approximately 30% of its purchases from the domestic market including SMEs, while domestically supporting more than 4,500 dealers, and 350 service centers.Higher Export Earnings - Since the expanded capacity will be directed to exports, IFC will help to increase the country''s foreign currency earnings and thereby recover from the current economic turmoil.   Electronics Industry - Both Beko''s long-term relationship with domestic suppliers and ""learning by doing"" experience supports the continued emergence of an electronic components industry, which, in turn, serves to strengthen the growth of an overall electronics industry in Turkey.  In recent years, due to the solid growth of electronics manufacturers, the industry has increasingly invested not only in capacity, but also in R&D to improve the overall quality and design of new products.  In line with the development of Turkey as a technology-related hub, the company''s plans to expand into the engineering contract business could be expected to have important spillover effects related to R&D, new product development initiatives, and production technologies across the wider manufacturing sector.IFC Role:  Mobilization of long-term capital under the IFC B Loan program - Despite its export orientation and success to date, Beko has been largely unable to attract long-term funding at reasonable terms.  The proposed B Loan aims to provide reasonably priced long-term financing, which is important not only for ensuring profitability in a highly competitive global industry, but also for strengthening the company''s position vis-a-vis its key customers who value long-term financial stability.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityThe environmental documentation (ERS) will be posted on the notice board at the entrance of the plant in Beylikduzu.","Beko Elektronik A.S. is one of Turkeys leading manufacturers of consumer electronic products, with annual revenues of US$346 million for 2001, of which more than 50% comprise export sales to 46 countries concentrated in Europe, CIS, and the Middle East.

Since its creation, RSB has rapidly increased its retail loan portfolio and is well-positioned to become a market leader.  The Bank is now considering how to leverage its retail lending experience in order to enter the SME market by applying similar techniques and to build a profitable small business finance operation, focusing on segments of the market where there is most overlap with providing financial services to individuals.  As of the end of 2001, the Bank had a strong net worth of US$28.6 million and assets of US$71.2 million equivalent.Development Impact: The limited development of the financial sector is one of the major weaknesses of the Russian economy.  This project would help address these weaknesses in two ways.  First, retail banking is very restricted in Russia; only a small percentage of the population have bank accounts, and consumer lending to individuals is minimal.  RSB could have a significant impact on the development of the sector, both through its own activities and through the demonstration effect on other banks, resulting in considerable benefits for development of a real retail banking sector in Russia.  Second, a significant proportion of RSB''s business will involve lending to SMEs.  Whereas in most countries in the region, SMEs have been an engine of economic growth and constitute the backbone of the economy, Russia''s SMEs cannot realize their growth potential due to insufficient access to external financing and lack of financial services.  Development of RSB''s SME operations will help broaden SMEs'' access to bank financing.WBG Strategy and IFC Role:  Helping the development of the local banking sector and its recovery from the financial crisis of 1998 is a central part of the World Bank Group''s strategy in Russia.  Commercial sources of equity and other long-term funding for Russian banks remain very limited unless they belong to one of the big financial industrial groups.  Therefore, IFCs equity investment in RSB would help the Bank continue its dynamic growth and allow it to leverage its experience in retail lending by building a small business finance operation. The project will also support IFCs strategy in Russia by identifying banks which, over time, can grow into substantial commercial lending institutions, and become significant players in the financial sector and the economy in general.  RSB is one such institution which requires additional capital as well as the benefit of external corporate guidance to implement its ambitious growth strategy.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category FI Type 1 project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.

It will invest in pre-feasibility stage (after the resource has been identified), feasibility study stage, and early stages of production in junior mining projects.  The fund will also invest in small-size spin-offs from restructured/reorganized mining companies.  In Canada and Australia, for example, junior mining companies play an important role in bringing new resources into production - they are more effective at grassroots exploration than majors.  In South Africa, the development of mineral resources has been dominated by large mining houses with limited participation by junior mining companies.  This is due to limited access to mineral rights and lack of access to capital.  In February 2000, the South African government together with some South African mining companies and aspirant mining juniors launched the Bakubung Initiative (BI).  Its objective was to promote junior mining activities in South Africa.  They set out to do so in three ways:Provide input into the revision of South Africa''s mining legislation (the new Minerals Development Bill);Facilitate the creation of mining funds to invest in junior mining companies; andFacilitate the set up of a mentor group, consisting of persons with extensive mining and financial experience, that would provide junior mining entrepreneurs with training and advice, transferring knowledge and skills.NAMF, together with the parallel establishment of a mentor program to support prospective investment projects, is the result of initiatives (2) and (3) above.Through the above initiatives, South Africa plans to transform its mining sector - to revitalize it and make it more representative.  Junior mining ventures are expected to play an important role in this process.  The fund will focus initially on South African opportunities but selective opportunities in the Southern and Central Africa will be considered.  By investing in NAMF, IFC will provide long-term funding to junior mining ventures.  It will also signal to other providers of funding, especially venture capitalists and the local stock exchanges, to consider investing in junior mining ventures.

SFMF will be structured around three outcome-led programs, delivered through a combination of sector-wide capacity building, institution-specific technical assistance, selected special projects, and horizontal support.1. Responsible Institutions Program:  Promotion and facilitation of commercially-driven environmental and social responsibility and responsiveness in the delivery of banking, leasing, insurance and other services to the private sector in emerging markets; 2. Sustainable Inward Investment:  Catalytic activities to stimulate the profitable uptake of sustainable and socially responsible investment principles in the private equity/venture capital and asset management sectors; 3.

BDO''s affiliation with the ShoeMart Group has also been instrumental to growth, as the bank has been able to leverage the relationships developed by the SM retailing businesses with their suppliers.Project Purpose: (1) By investing US$20 million (in the form of a convertible loan) that would qualify as Tier II capital under Central Bank regulations, IFC would allow BDO to increase its capital base, leveraging on its existing Tier I equity, to expand its operations.  This would be one of the first instances of a Tier II instrument in the Philippines (following upon recently announced guidelines by the Central Bank), and the first by a private unlisted bank, allowing IFC to deploy a fairly new capital market instrument in the local market.(2) Under the Partial Guarantee Facility, IFC would guarantee up to 40% of new loans extended by BDO, primarily to its existing clients in the middle market in order to enable these borrowers to increase their borrowing capacities and, therefore, improve and expand their operations and/or restructure their balance sheets.Development Impact: The main development impact of the proposed Tier II instrument is the positive impact on the local capital market by the introduction of a financial product based on the new Central Bank Tier II guidelines, and the positive impact on BDO''s capital structure as it works towards becoming a successful medium-size bank in the Philippines.  The proposed facility''s main development impact is the demonstration effect created by IFC''s support to the Philippine middle market, at a time when Philippine commercial banks are still reluctant to consider medium-tenor financing to medium sized Philippine companies.  It is hoped that both components of the project will send a positive signal to international investors and restore confidence in the Philippine private sector, particularly viable borrowing businesses, which can generate employment.IFC''s Role: First, IFC is providing Tier II capital to BDO to increase its capital base in order to expand is operations and improve its capital structure.  Second, by providing the Partial Guarantee Facility, IFC is acting in a catalytic role by enabling the bank to increase the size and the maturity of its medium-tenor financing to middle-market companies, thereby assisting local, middle market companies to strengthen operations in an environment where most commercial banks are hesitant to lend due to rising NPLs.  With BDO being seen as a successful bank and by helping the middle market in this way, this facility may open doors for other Philippine banks to provide similar facilities, as they recognize the value of IFC involvement and credit due diligence.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Financial Intermediary (FI) Type 1/2  project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.

The company will also be capable of supplying new products, including large glass panels used in the construction of modern commercial buildings and improved and higher quality automotive products for Russian JVs with Western Manufacturers, and other possible new entrants.IFCs role in the project is twofold. First, by providing long-term finance, IFC will assist a project with long-term foreign currency needs which are currently unavailable in Russia today. Given the sponsors desire to share Russia risk and the reluctance on the part of commercial banks to provide long-term debt to Russian projects, the lack of IFCs involvement would constrain the companys ability to finance its activities.  Second, IFCs involvement will allow the Corporation to continue to leverage its strong client relationship to undertake a project in a difficult and uncertain environment.  The project will enhance the positive demonstration effect for local businesses Borsteklo has had through their best practice production and environmental standards. The company will also continue to provide sustainable employment to the people of Bor located outside of Nizhny Novgorod where few other viable employment opportunities exist.  Indirectly, Borsteklo will also continue to help create jobs and improve infrastructure in many key upstream and downstream businesses.

Corporate Citizenship Facility,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Pending Approval,World,World Region,INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION,Risk Mgmt. and Financial Policy,2002-05-06T04:00:00Z,2002-06-06T04:00:00Z,C,"","IFCs approach to sustainable development is to recognize its potential to bring financial value to businesses in emerging economies.  By making more visible the business case for more advanced approaches to Corporate Citizenship and Sustainability, IFC believes that broader benefits in the provision of public goods, social equity in local economic development, and environmental conditions will accrue.  Research by IFC (and others) has demonstrated that these links exist.  The Corporation has developed a substantial data base of IFC experiences to help inform and guide future efforts in these areas, and is planning to jointly publish key findings and conclusions later this year.  However, recognition and understanding of these opportunities among businesses in emerging economies are highly variable.  They therefore face risks in new potential barriers to trade and investment in relation to social and environmental performance.The Corporate Citizenship Facility is designed to support best practices in emerging markets businesses, disseminate them through business to business interactions, and leverage benefits at the sector level.  The CCF will implement its objectives through three programs:  (i) the Environmental Stewardship Program, (ii) the Communities, Stakeholders and Engagement Program, and (iii) the Employment and Employees Program.  The issues to be addressed through these programs are coalescing as core developmental challenges and critical business issues developing countries.IFC''s role:  The design of the CCF draws heavily on IFCs extensive experience in working on environmental and social issues with project sponsors.  It responds to a growing demand from clients for assistance to address changing business expectations in relation to environmental and social performance, that are being driven by external pressures (such as concerns about the impact of globalization, consumer and shareholder action, access to markets and capital); internal responses (such as brand and reputational risk assurance strategies, and increasing cost efficiencies through more resource efficient production); and the availability and use of information about company activities.   The CCF will enhance the commitment that IFC has made to expand the range of non-financial value-added support to clients, and will support the global leadership role in support of sustainability that IFC is seeking to develop.  Efforts in the area of corporate citizenship to date have been largely supported by individual and ad-hoc trust fund financing.  To achieve the required scale and impact of change in our client base and wider private sector goes beyond the level of support that IFC can currently provide.  If IFC is to achieve significant change, it needs to be able to deliver a more proactive, focused, and structured program of project support, through a dedicated project facility.Developmental impact:  CCF will have  potentially significant development impact through the provision of guidance and support to the private sector in the areas of corporate social responsibility and environmental stewardship.   It is clear that environmental and social performance is becoming an increasingly important issue for many businesses  in emerging economies and that enhanced performance in these areas can deliver business benefits through reducing operational and reputational risk, increasing access to capital, securing price premiums and market access opportunities, and increasing employee fidelity and retention.  By strengthening the environmental and social capacity of companies, CCF will help private sector companies to:  (i) identify, define, and promote better practices;  (ii) help realize opportunities;  and (iii) disseminate and replicate successful findings more widely through the private sector in emerging economies.  As such, the objectives of CCF are closely aligned with emerging commitments and strategy in relation to IFCs Sustainability Initiative.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category C project, according to IFC''s Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because it is likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityn/a","IFC will manage the Corporate Citizenship Facility (CCF, or the facility/), which in turn will support a number of projects working with private sector sponsors, industry associations, and civil society groups.","The facility''s total net costs over a five-year period are estimated at US$15.0 million.

Bavaria,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Colombia,BAVARIA S A,Regional Industry - MAS LAC,2002-05-07T04:00:00Z,2002-06-13T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"Founded in 1889, GEB is the leading beverage producer and distributor in Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama.   It produces beer and non-alcoholic beverages (water, fruit juices, milk and malt-drinks) at twelve manufacturing plants.  In addition to its core business, the company actively promotes community and social programs, such as developing grain farmers and fruit growers throughout the country,  sponsoring sporting events, and endorsing cultural and educational programs.  The project is designed to allow the company to increase the efficiency of its production and distribution facilities; further develop its non-alcoholic beverage products, including fruit juices and water; and expand outside Colombia within the beverage sector. Development Impact· Regional Focus:  GEB is embarking on a program that will result in investments in a number of Andean and Central American countries.  These countries by-and-large lack domestic capital markets and also find it difficult to attract foreign investors.· Investment and Growth:  The investment program, which is significant both in terms of its size and its timing (given the situation in Colombia) will result in growth of output, increased productivity, and an associated rise in income in the targeted countries.· Benefits to Consumers:  The venture will introduce a wider choice of beverages and higher standards for processing and packaging.· Fiscal Benefits:  Beverage companies such as GEB are an important source of tax revenues for governments (including sales and income taxes).  GEB is the single largest tax paying entity in Colombia and it is also expected to be an important tax generator in the other countries in which it operates.· Supply Linkages, from the investment program, should flow to farmers engaged in supply of grains and other raw materials and to manufacturers of glass bottles, crowns, cases, and other packaging supplies.· Corporate Governance:  As the leading Colombian blue chip, the implementation of a new corporate governance program at GEB will set an important example for other companies in Colombia and increase the attractiveness of the market for investors.· Demonstration Effect:  IFCs support and its success in syndicating a B loan could have an important demonstration impact at a particularly difficult time for Colombia.IFC RoleUntil 1999, the Groups complicated organizational configuration hampered its ability to tap local and external financing sources.  IFC is assisting the company in concluding its organizational and financial restructuring, thereby helping the company to position itself for growth and further investment in the region.  Given Colombias current situation, GEB is seeking IFCs assistance in order to tap international capital markets, which are currently not accessible for term financing even to Colombian blue-chips.  The IFC financing package (including the B loan) would be critical for completing GEBs financial plan.  IFC would also assist the company in a number of other areas, including: (a) Corporate Governance:  GEB is in the process of upgrading its corporate governance practices and IFC is supporting the companys efforts in this area; (b) Environment:  With IFCs assistance, the company would further improve its environment, health, and safety standards by bringing them into compliance with World Bank guidelines; and (c) External Linkages:  the IFC financing package would enable the company to expand initiatives with suppliers, including: (i) an outsourcing program that GEB has developed for former employees which includes training and support for undertaking warehousing and distribution activities; and (ii) technical and financial support that the company provides to fruit growers and other suppliers of agricultural inputs.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects.

Empirical evidence has shown that credit bureaus are critical to the expansion of credit, that the availability and use of credit bureau reports in credit decisions increase the quality of the credit decisions, and that credit bureaus provide a significant protection for financial institutions against fraud.IFC has been working closely with the World Bank over the past two years to build capacity and promote better credit information infrastructure in our member countries.  The first phase of our efforts focused primarily on promotional undertakings, including an international conference on credit information and credit scoring in 2001, roundtables and video-conferences hosted in or for a number of countries including Central America.  The proposed investment in TUCA would be IFCs first investment in a consumer and commercial credit bureau.The investment would support and finance TUCAs expansion in Central America through the establishment of new subsidiaries, as well as outsourcing arrangements for and investments in existing credit bureaus.   TUCA, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, will be providing both consumer and commercial credit information primarily to financial institutions.  The project is expected to significantly improve the current credit information infrastructure in the region, and allow financial institutions to make better credit decisions and pro-actively manage and monitor their existing portfolios while at the same time lower operating expenses.

In 1997, MWCI won a competitive tender to operate the Metro Manila East service zone (1997 population: 4.5 million) under a 25-year concession agreement. It inherited facilities that require significant rehabilitation and to date MWCI has spent approximately US$20 million for its own capital expenditures and close to US$60 million in projects funded through multilateral loans to MWSS. Upon commencement of operations, MWCI delivered an average of 440 millions of liters per day (MLD) to 325,000 households.  Billed volume in the last 4 years has increased 70% to 750 MLD in December 2001. During the same period the number of households served has gone up to 428,000 and the population served has increased from 3.0 million to 4.05 million (from 70 percent to 89 percent). Water availability has also gone up during the last 4 years.  The percentage of areas that have 24-hour access to water has increased from 26 percent in 1997 to 55 percent in 2001.MWCIs Operating Improvements since 1997 TakeoverExpanded Coverage67% to 89% of populationImproved 24 hour supply26% to 83%Reduced NRW63% to 51%Built New Distribution Lines170 kmsThe improvements in coverage and billed volume during the last 4 years were also accompanied by a reduction in NRW, which fell by close to 12 percentage points from 63% of treated water in 1997 to 52% in 2001.  MWCI has pushed up the quality standard from 91% compliant in 1997 to 99.5% in 2001, exceeding the 95% required by the National Standards for Drinking Water.MWCI inherited 2,165 employees at the turnover date and has reduced this figure to 1,530 without mandatory redundancies, largely through a voluntary early retirement scheme. The vast majority of MWCIs staff are ex-MWSS employees. There have been no reductions in pay.MWCI Efficiency Indicators 1997-200119971998199920002001No. of Household Connections (000s)325340390409428  Population Served (millions)3.03.13.63.764.05  Staff per 1000 connections6.35.14.83.83.6Total Operating Cost per cubic meter of billed water5.955.475.214.774.73The Project as defined includes (i) new water sources development; (ii) service expansion to East and Southeast areas; (iii) network distribution improvement; (iv) other pipe extension and improvement projects; (v) water supply facilities; (vi) non-revenue water (NRW) reduction programs; (vii) sewerage & sanitation services; and (viii) payment of concession fees to Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System(MWSS), the conceding authority. The concession fees finance the portion of MWSSs debt to multilaterals which has been incurred for capital works programs benefiting MWCIs service area, as well as MWSSs counterpart funding toward those programs and its administrative costs. The impact of inadequate water and sanitation services falls primarily on the poor. Badly served by the formal sector, the poor make their own, often inadequate, arrangements to meet basic survival needs. Many fetch water from long distances or end up paying high prices to water vendors for very small quantities of water or enduring significant coping costs in terms of investments in backup tanks and pumps. The clear need for basic water and sanitation services for the poor assume even greater significance when the linkages with other dimensions of poverty are considered.   Water and sanitation related sicknesses put severe burdens on health services and keep children out of school. Human waste poses a tremendous social cost through pollution of rivers and groundwater.  Thus, improved water and sanitation services contribute to poverty reduction and growth through their impact on, inter alia, health, private sector development, urban development, environment and water resource management. MWCIs investment program, through expansion of coverage in water, sanitation and sewerage, thus makes a significant contribution to the economic development of the Philippines. This positive contribution is amplified by the focus the project has on expansion of coverage to lower income residents through innovative arrangements for connection and payment. There have been a limited number of successful privatizations in the water and sanitation sector in emerging markets.  IFC''s assistance to MWCI would build upon the earlier IFC privatization advisory work by supporting a concessionaire who has begun to demonstrate the efficiencies and client responsiveness that a private sector provider can introduce to the provision of public services.  By supporting this successful private water concessionaire IFC will send a positive signal to the market and to other governments considering water privatizations. One of the reasons MWCI has approached IFC is because local banks are not offering financing of the appropriate maturity. The sponsors further believe that completing a financing with IFC would be a signal of quality that would help it in later rounds of financing, including a planned IPO. In addition to these practical points, Ayala Corporation, which cultivates a corporate image as a socially responsible company, has expressed interest in IFC for broader developmental reasons. Ayala Corporation perceives that the presence of a prestigious institution such as IFC in MWCI would be good for the Philippines by demonstrating that privatization can work despite the challenges posed by poverty in the Philippines, and that a well-run company can attract financing in an emerging market context.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityCopies of the environmental documents are available at Manila Water Company Main Office.","The project sponsors are Ayala Corporation (Ayala), United Utilities, Bechtel Corporation and Mitsubishi Corporation.

Galata Gas Field Project,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,Bulgaria,Petreco S.A.R.L.,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2002-05-08T04:00:00Z,2002-06-12T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"The borrower will be Petreco S.a.r.l., a Luxembourg private limited company. Its assets and activity are solely in Bulgaria, namely the development of the Galata Field and a 100% interest in the exploration permit for the rest of Block-III and the adjoining Block Kaliakra, 99, in offshore Bulgaria. As stated earlier, part of its interest is held through its Bulgarian subsidiary, Petreco Bulgaria, which will execute the project.  The proposed project involves the development of the Galata gas field.  An independent reserve engineer has certified proved reserves of 49 bcf of dry gas. The development of the field will involve the drilling of two wells, the installation of a production platform, the construction of an 83 km pipeline and related processing and metering facilities. Melrose expects to achieve first gas by the second half of 2003.Bulgaria has very limited indigenous gas production and its domestic market for natural gas is still in an early stage of development. The sector does, however,  play a key role as a gas transit country for deliveries of Russian gas to Turkey, Greece, and Macedonia. This role is poised to become more important with increasing deliveries. As a result of it being a gas transit country, Bulgaria has access to imported gas as well as a well developed gas transmission system which provides a solid base to support gas distribution in the country. Development of a competitive gas market is an objective of the government of Bulgaria and towards this goal concessions are on offer for local distribution by private companies. The development of the Galata Field will help introduce competition in gas supply, albeit in a limited way (around 15% of total annual supply). More importantly, the successful development of the Galata Field will have a significant impact on the perceptions of other potential upstream investors and on Bulgaria''s standing as a responsible gas transit country.  Secondly, it is expected that the Galata Field, upon depletion will be used as a gas storage facility, thus strengthening Bulgaria''s role as a gas transit country with its attendant revenue generating benefits. Third, royalty and other taxes from the project, including production bonus, will accrue to the government. Fourth, the sponsors have committed , under the terms of the concession agreement, to actively support local companies in project execution and to train Bulgarian employees. Finally, the employment during construction phase will total several hundred people and the core operating and management staff in production will be approximately 30 people.At a proven reserve of 49 Bcf, Galata is a relatively small gas field and it is believed that this is the reason that Texaco, which discovered the field more than a decade ago did not pursue the development of the field. From the country''s point of view, commercial production from  the Galata Field is important for development of a competitive  domestic gas market. The project has not been able to attract private financing, even for the relatively shorter terms needed, and IFC''s participation is critical for the financing of the project. Secondly, the gas sector in Bulgaria and in particular Bulgargaz, the national gas company, is in a process of change. IFC''s participation gives comfort to the sponsors that these changes would be undertaken in a manner which does not jeopardize the commercial viability of the project.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityMinistry of Environment and Waters67, William Gladstone str.Sofia 1000, BulgariaMunicipality Varna43, Maria Luiza blvdVarna 9000, Bulgaria Petreco1, Atanas Dalchev str.Varna 9010, Bulgaria","The project is sponsored by Melrose Resources plc,  a UK oil and gas company established in May 1997 and listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1999.

FCL was established in 1974 as a state owned company, and uses the dry process technology of the 1970s. It has a kiln capacity of 800 tons per day, translating to around 340,000 tons of cement a year. The project would involve the post privatization rehabilitation and modernization of  the company. The project would consist of (i) optimization of production capacity of the existing facility of the borrowers located at Lukavac, Macan Marije bb, Bosnia and Herzegovina from its current cement output level of about 260,000 tons per year (tpy) to a full capacity level of 340,000 tpy (stage 1); (ii) expansion of the existing cement grinding capacity to 800,000 tpy (stage 2); and (iii) expansion of clinker production capacity by installing a new kiln line of 2,000 tons per day (tpd) capacity to match the cement production level of 800,000 tpy (stage 3). The first two stages will be implemented together as Phase I, while the kiln will be constructed as Phase II of the project.The project is underpinned by strong local demand driven by the need to complete repairs to buildings, bridges and other infrastructure damaged during the war. Demand is also growing from new construction of industrial and commercial facilities, fueled by a high post war GDP growth rate and is currently being met through heavy cement imports (estimated at 900,000 tpy in 2001). The modernization will also bring down production costs and enable the company to compete with imports, thus contributing to foreign exchange savings.   The project provides an opportunity for IFC to support privatization and one of the largest and highly visible FDI in BiH.  Moreover, the underdeveloped financial system in BiH is not able to provide the sponsors with access to adequate long-term limited recourse financing.  In addition, IFCs review and approval of the project will provide confidence to other potential lenders and signal an improving investment climate in BiH, as the current perception of BiH, and its associated macroeconomic risk, by many international banks is somewhat negative.  IFCs investment, including long term funding for its own account and mobilizing commercial resources, would also play an important role in assisting a company whose modernization would have a substantial positive impact on the economic development in the area.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityERS is displayed at the Culture Hall in Lukavac.","The project sponsors are the Asamer & Hufnagl Group (Asamer), a large Austrian private company in the aggregates and construction business; and Alpine Mayreder bau GmbH (Alpine), another leading Austrian private construction company (together the sponsors).

Grupo Andre Maggi,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Brazil,Amaggi Exportação e Importação Ltda.,"Gbl Ind, Manufact, Agribus & Services",2002-05-09T04:00:00Z,2002-06-14T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"Company Description:  Amaggi, a major soybean merchandiser, crusher, and exporter was established in 1950 in the state of Parana by the André Maggi family of Italian origin.  In 1979, Amaggi moved to the state of Mato Grosso to take advantage of the enormous agricultural potential of the Center-West region of Brazil.  At that time, total soybean production accounted for less than 1% of Brazils total production.  In 1983, the company started pre-financing farmers.  In 2001, the company entered the crushing business to take advantage of the added value of soybean by-products, such as soyoil and soymeal.  The companys sales volume was 1.8 million metric tons in 2001, mostly for the export market (88%) and with total sales of US$342 million equivalent. The companys working capital cycle starts with the advances to farmers at the beginning of the cropping season (June-July), and ends with the building up of soybean inventories when the company purchases and stores the soybeans at harvest time (January  April).  The companys peak sales occur following the harvest, in May  June.  Project Description:  The project consists of financing the growing working capital requirements of Amaggi.  Amaggis working capital consists mainly of (i) farmers advances, such as inputs and cash for soybean production, and (ii) inventory of soybean and its by-products.  It is proposed that IFC finances up to US$30 million of the projected permanent working capital increase, which would have otherwise been financed by short-term funding.IFC Role:  The proposed project will back a company that has demonstrated its capability to respond to challenging infrastructure issues and created an efficient export channel for its soybeans. Also in line with the World Bank''s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), the IFC loan will stabilize the balance sheet structure of a midsize company in one of the countrys most important export commodities.  Because of the financial intermediation role played by Amaggi in its farmers financing program, the IFC project will be indirectly reaching almost 900 farmers which benefit from companys advances in a cost effective approach.Developmental Impact:  Section A:  The project will provide the company with a more stable source of financing for a portion of its permanent current assets, namely advances to farmers and a minimum inventory of beans, particularly for its crushing operations, given the deterioration in the regional economy and the possible contagion of the Argentine crisis to its Mercosur neighbors. This long-term financing will substitute short term debt to mitigate the possible risk of refinancing which could follow from a financial crisis in the country. As such, a financial and economic rate of return cannot be meaningfully calculated. Section B: The experience of other countries (Asia, Argentina) indicates that, in times of crisis, agribusiness companies dependent on short-term debt are forced to restrict their operations. In the case of Amaggi, advances to farmers would most likely be curtailed, with consequences on farmers ability to purchase inputs and reach current production levels. Also, the company would be hard pressed to purchase and store soybeans from the farmers, thus limiting its processing season. More soybeans would be directed to exports rather than storage, which would result in lowered prices at harvest time because of bottlenecks in logistics. A more stable source of funding for working capital will therefore provide partial insurance against the refinancing risk, with widespread benefits to farmers and the companys operation.Section C: Supervision of the development impact will focus on the companys ability to sustain the pre-and post-harvest financing of the soybean supply chain: (i) advances to farmers; (ii) purchases of soybeans; and (iii) crushing of soybeans.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityThe Environmental documents will be located in the following locally affected communities:  Itacoatiara, Porto Velho, Rondonopolis, Sapezal.","Amaggi (the company) is 100% owned by the André Maggi family and is one of the three other main operating companies belonging to the family. The other two are Hermasa Navegaçao da Amazonia (Hermasa), the transport arm, and Agropecuaria Maggi Limitada (Agropecuaria), the familys own farm and also a supplier of soybeans to Amaggi.  The establishment of Hermasa was a response for overcoming the poor infrastructure that prevented in the past, the flourishing of soybeans in Mato Grosso. Today, Hermasa, with its barge terminal at Porto Velho in the state of Rondonia and its deepwater port in the Amazon river system at Itacoatiaria, in the state of Amazonas, is a highly efficient export channel for Amaggi soybeans.  In June 1991, the Maggi family decided to bring the activities of the three operating companies under one umbrella and created a holding, Grupo André Maggi Participaçoes Limitada (GAM or the group).  The Chairman of the group and the company is Mr. Blairo Maggi, the son of  the founder of Amaggi and the person who conceived the highly successful infrastructure initiative which has given Amaggi an edge over competition.

Asia Strategic Investments Corporation,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,East Asia and the Pacific,China,Asian Strategic Investments Corp. Beijing Representative Office,"Gbl Ind, Manufact, Agribus & Services",2002-05-14T04:00:00Z,2002-06-15T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"The Group operates as an integrated entity supplying a wide range of automotive components (including foundry products, brake systems, diesel fuel injection systems, electrical products, and engine parts and accessories) to the Chinese and the international markets.    In 2001, it had revenues of about US$160 million, EBITDA of US$25 million, and a net income of US$1.8 million.  Total assets at the end of 2001 were US$400 million and shareholder funds were US$235 million (including equity and interest free shareholder loans). 	The project is to establish a new company (Newco) which will acquire the Funds'' ownership of the Group, thereby converting the Group ownership to a corporate structure.  The current fund ownership structure restricts the Group from upgrading existing operations, taking advantage of many new investment opportunities, and financing itself in an optimal manner.  Through this ownership restructuring the Group will be able to effectively increase its value added, by allowing it to develop its franchise as a reliable and comprehensive supplier of quality auto components, and to leverage its management and manufacturing infrastructure.  The acquisition of the Funds'' ownership of the Group will be effected by the Limited Partners converting about 30% of their ownership interest into shares in Newco, and Newco purchasing the remaining 70%.  The management of ASIMCO will become the management of Newco, and the ASIMCO staff that currently manage the operating units will be retained to manage the operations.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACTThe proposed project is expected to contribute to the transformation and rationalization of the industry, which has traditionally been dominated by inefficient state-owned enterprises. This is all the more important as China''s entry into the WTO is likely to have a significant impact on the automotive component industry in China, both in terms of challenges and opportunities. Through the project, IFC will support a group of restructured SOEs, who can become successful examples of China''s restructuring and privatization process.The Group has been a pioneer in introducing modern management techniques, while relying on local managerial talent for plant operations. This has resulted in significant welfare benefits for local staff and the strengthening of local managerial skills and capacity. The Group was named one of the ""Ten Best Employers in China"" as part of the ""Best Employers in Asia"" study conducted by the Asian Wall Street Journal, The Far East Economic Review and Hewitt Associates. The Group possesses the management ability to provide leadership in the Chinese automotive components sector with regard to EHSS performance - and can drive these issues down to the next level of the supply chain pyramid, thus enhancing the development impact of the project.IFC ROLEIFC''s assistance is targeted at supporting privatization and restructuring of the automotive component industry to better prepare it to meet the challenges of a more competitive market environment following WTO entry.  In the absence of IFC support, the restructuring of the Group is unlikely to move ahead, as the current diffused ownership structure and the diverse interests and objectives of the many parties involved make it difficult to agree and implement an appropriate strategy. Moreover, IFC''s presence in the transaction is likely to be a source of comfort for co-investors which include development agencies and private investors.By assisting the Group in formalizing a performance based environmental management system, IFC is likely to play a vital role in improving its operating efficiency and in enhancing their ability to attract ""global customers"" that typically have environmental performance requirements for their suppliers. IFC will also continue to assist the Group with the identification of potential environmental technology products, for which there is strong demand in China. Finally, IFC will assist Newco in adopting best corporate governance policies and practices.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityThe environmental documents will be available at the Group''s headquarters at 4th Floor, Parkview Centre , 2 Jiangtai Road , South Side Chaoyang District, Beijing","Asian Strategic Investments Corporation (ASIMCO or the manager) is a Cayman Islands investment management company, headquartered in Beijing, that directly manages and operates an automotive components group (the Group) on behalf of two Limited Partnerships (the Funds).

The facility will comprise individual credit lines to selected partner banks (PBs) which will then be on-lent to micro and small enterprises (SMEs) through specialized micro and small business finance windows that will be created at the PB level for this purpose.The objective of the facility is to expand the frontier of finance by extending downward the range of market segments served by commercial financial institutions.  Thus, the facility will increase the availability of sustained credit to creditworthy SMEs, while at the same time building up the lending capacity and skill base of selected PBs.  To help achieve this objective, the project will be supported by a donor-funded Technical Assistance (TA) program.  The main objectives of this program are to (i) create and strengthen the SME departments at PBs; (ii) train all levels of SME lending personnel; (iii) develop new loan products; (iv) develop internal audit and management information systems; and (v) establish and evaluate SME departments as profit centers.This project capitalizes on the experience of a similar and successful EBRD program in Kazakhstan.  This existing program has shown strong financial and developmental results -- US$72.5 million has been disbursed under the program and the portfolio at risk is only 0.58%.  The new program will both increase the activity in Kazakhstan, and introduce it to additional Central Asian countries.The proposed facility will have a strong development impact, as it will introduce a micro and small business finance program to a wider market in Central Asia, building from the experience of an existing successful EBRD program in Kazakhstan.  It aims to improve the standard of living of the poorest segments of the populations in the countries to be covered by the facility  some of which are among the poorest in the world.  Micro finance is a key sector where IFC can focus its efforts to support economic development.  The proposed project is part of a concerted WBG effort to develop partnerships with international micro finance support organizations and technical partners that stand as leaders in the field.The facility will assist in the development of the emerging micro and small business sector in Central Asia by augmenting financing to existing SMEs.  It will also have a strong institution-building role.  By providing selected PBs with training and technical assistance, the project will seek to address the shortage of banking skills that are necessary to establish a market-based banking environment, especially with respect to SMEs.  It will also fuel the expansion of SME operations into previously under-served regions of Central Asia.

CPEF intends to invest between US$5 million to US$20 million in each company and work with this company to develop international standards of management and governance so that it can be listed in international markets or attract strategic buyers. CPEF will be established as an 8 year closed-end Cayman vehicle with a capital of about US$100 million.  A Cayman company will be set up to be the GP of the fund.  IFCs Role: IFC''s strategy in China focuses on promoting development of the domestic private sector through capacity building and enhancing access to diversified sources of financing.  We believe this project fits well with such strategy.  In this project, IFC plays three important roles that include (1) supporting additional fund raising, (2) advocating international best practice corporate governance, and (3) building sustainable local institution. IFC''s survey of China''s private equity market has identified this team to be the best in the market. Supporting them to raise their first independent fund and achieve further success will enable the management team to raise subsequent funds both in dollars and local currency and thus become a sustainable Chinese institution.Development Impact: The private equity industry in China is underdeveloped. As a result, there is a lack of the private equity financing and management expertise which is needed to help Chinese companies grow and reach maturity. The project will support the development of a viable fund management institution in an area which is relatively new to China through the introduction of sound management practices.

The main investment focus will be on later stage businesses, with limited exposure to fast growing telecommunications and later round technology companies. Advent will add value through active investment management, majority share ownership positions, and board and executive committee participation.Development impact:Second tier companies in Latin America are affected by financing constraints and lack of access to best management practices. The fund will contribute to the economic development of the region by supporting the development of these companies with equity financing and managerial and strategic support. This will be achieved through the active involvement of Advent''s locally-based Latin American team of 15 investment professionals with extensive private equity and senior management experience, and through leveraging Advent''s global private equity and industry expertise as well as relationships with over 30 multinational corporations.After having peaked in 1998, private equity fund raising for the Latin American region has dropped sharply and is now back to pre-1994 levels. The fund, using a disciplined and thorough investment approach, will help demonstrate that the private equity model can be successful in Latin America, attracting further private equity resources to the region.

E.S.P. (Triple A), the investment arm - AAA Servicios S.A. (AAA Servicios), and the procurement arm - Gestion Integral de Suministros Ltda. (GIS).  Triple A has a turnover of US$74 million, net profit of US$8.9 million and assets of US$154 million (for the year ending December 31, 2001).  Triple A has been undertaking the Suroccidente project to extend water and sewerage services to the south west (Suroccidente) part of Barranquilla, which is the poorest part of the city. This investment is part of a 20-year concession, which has been duly extended for 20 years until the year 2033, to provide water, sewerage and solid waste  services to the city of Barranquilla, the fourth largest city in Colombia, with a population of 1.5 million. The  investments will be used for expansion of the network and sewage treatment.  As a result, 350,000 low-income inhabitants, shall be connected to the network. Water and sewerage coverage for Barranquilla as a whole, will increase from original levels of 93% and 74% respectively, to 99% for water and 96% for sewerage. The project consists of a corporate financing package for Triple A through a proposed credit enhancement of a Peso bond to be issued by the company. The proceeds of the bond will be used to retire bridge debt, that was used to finance Triple A''s investments in water and sewage infrastructure in the city of Barranquilla, mostly represented by the Suroccidente project. The proposed project will be among the first in which IFC provides a partial credit guarantee in Colombia.  The partial guarantee would allow the company to obtain significant benefits and reduce project risks by lowering cost of borrowing, extending maturities, matching debt service obligations to project cash flows, and reducing currency risk, thus providing an instrument which will satisfactorily address several of the issues which are traditional risks for financing the water and sanitation sector.  This issue would therefore contribute towards deepening the Colombian capital market''s capacity for longer term financing, particularly for new sectors such as water, wastewater, and solid waste management.

Part of the loan proceeds will be applied to new investments of the group, most likely to occur in Brazil''s infrastructure sector, in which case it would do so through AG Concessoes.  The World Bank Group''s primary objective in assisting Brazil, is the achievement of sustainable, private-sector led, broadly shared growth.  Priorities are: creation of new, formal employment opportunities in internationally competitive private firms, broadened financial access for the commercial system, and delivery of improvements in areas of basic needs and/or visible impact on standards of living: housing, water, health, education, urban transport.  Specifically, IFC''s strategy, consistent with this objective, is: backing companies that will create growth,  supporting activities which demonstrate tangible benefits of liberalization (such as water, health, education, and urban and inter-modal transport), investing in financial and physical infrastructure to improve the prospects for sustained growth; and broad support for business leading to development in the Northeast.  IFC finds supporting AG''s operations consistent with its strategy for the following reasons.  AG group owns an array of businesses that contribute to the objectives stated above.  First, AG Telecom has brought much needed improvements to the telephone system in the Northeast of Brazil. Second, it is AG Concessoes'' strategy to participate in privatizations of public infrastructure and it is likely to benefit from part of this financing to increase its business. Third, CAG participates significantly in important large infrastructure projects that benefit Brazil''s economic growth.  CAG seeks to be an efficient company and financial efficiency is an important element that translates into lower cost of construction and thus benefits the economy of Brazil. Lastly, AG group is rapidly  modernizing, bringing modern management concepts and creating jobs for skilled professionals including in information technology. This gives young Brazilians a chance to apply their skills at one of Brazil''s most influential firms.   Currently companies in Brazil have limited access to capital markets as a result of global economic and political conditions.  The upcoming elections are compounded by this problem and Brazil is affected, to some degree, by the Argentine crisis.  This means that even for large companies financing is gradually becoming more difficult to access and tenors, historically short, may decrease even further in the near future.  In addition, it is AG''s intention to maintain its ability to invest over the next 24 months and this requires the group to have a stable financial structure.  This requires a tenor not currently available in the local market.  Finally, the group has shown interest in improving further its corporate governance and furtherance of sound environmental and practices.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected community- Rua de Ajuda 35, Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro- Rua Dr. Geraldo Campos Moreira 375, 10th fl., Brooklin Novo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo- Avenida do Contorno 8123, Cidade Jardim, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais","The Andrade Gutierrez Group (AG group or the company) is one of Brazil''s premier industrial conglomerates which holds its operations through four strategic sub-holding companies: Construtora AG (CAG), AG Telecom, AG Concessoes and AG Investimentos Imobiliários.

The Andrade Gutierrez Group was founded in 1948 and focused on the construction of public infrastructure projects such as highways, hydroelectric plants, airports and industrial plants.  Privatization of key infrastructure sectors in Brazil in the 1990s allowed CAG to expand into public infrastructure concessions and telecommunications to leverage its experience in the construction industry.  In 1997, AG defined a new strategy and decided that the group''s structure should be rationalized by regrouping the assets into a holding company structure.  The current corporate structure was set-up in 1999.  Before the reorganization, the construction company owned most of the other operating companies but the volume of the non-construction business grew too large to retain it within CAG.

A technical assistance package will have to be secured from donors in order to overcome some of the short-term constraints imposed by the Afghan environment, in particular with respect to security, gender outreach, the lack of infrastructure, and training of staff.FMBA will be incorporated as a full-service financial institution to provide both credit and savings products.  Currently, there is an outdated banking legislation in place and the Central Bank lacks supervision capacity.  This is likely to change over the next few months with the adoption of a new law.  Based upon the new regulations and respective minimum capital requirements for deposit-taking institutions, the final institutional choice will be made. The project is expected to have a strong development impact as: (1) It will create the first commercially sustainable micro-finance institution in Afghanistan contributing to the development of micro-finance as a viable and attractive commercial activity, and providing financial services to the poor and underserved.(2) It will contribute to the reconstruction and economic development of Afghanistan by providing financing to the most dynamic sector of the fledgling economy - micro and small businesses.(3) It will develop the financial sector by providing basic financial services currently not available in the market.

Satipel Industrial S.A.,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Brazil,DEXCO SA,Regional Industry - MAS LAC,2002-07-16T04:00:00Z,2002-08-30T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"Satipel, a medium-sized, family-owned company, is one of Brazil''s leading manufacturers of particleboard.  In 2001, the company produced 490,000 m3 of particleboard in 2001.  The proposed project will: refinance existing debt; make minor maintenance investments; finance environmental upgrades; and further invest in plantations.IFC RoleIFC has three important roles to play in this project. First, IFC will provide the necessary term financing for a medium-sized Brazilian company.  The Brazilian economic crisis, the political uncertainty stemming from the upcoming presidential election, the current crisis in Argentina, and the September 11 events in the United States,  have made long-term financing difficult to obtain for Brazilian companies. The dearth of such financing has been a major constraint for the development of the private sector, hampering modernization and employment growth in Brazil''s economy.  Under current conditions, both in international and domestic Brazilian financial markets, even large firms have difficult access to long term financing, driving a substantial consolidation in various industries. The only way for a commercially viable and otherwise efficient mid-size firm, such as Satipel, to compete is through the support of sources such as IFC.  Second, the IFC investment would introduce Satipel to international lending that would enhance its visibility and credibility preparing the company to go public in the next few years. Indeed, Satipel management intends to turn this family business into a large profitable public company. The owners have indicated their strong desire to have IFC as a partner in order to increase the chance of success of the companys upcoming initial public offering. Last, IFC''s involvement would support an environmentally-sound-wood-products company.Development ImpactThe proposed investment would improve the operating efficiency of a medium-sized enterprise. Furthermore, the project will assist the country in maximizing its comparative advantage in the forestry products. Satipel utilizes low cost plantation pine and helps consumers avoid the high transportation costs associated with imports. In addition, as part of the companys investments in the forestry operations, Satipel will provide financing to local farmers to introduce them to the forestry operations. The program is expected to reach more than 20 farmers, and a total of 500 ha. per year.  The company will provide the seedlings and extensive training to the farmers. The farmers will benefit from the use of non-adequate land for agriculture, diversifying their activities, taking advantage of the use of current labor, and thus, increasing their annual revenues from the use of the land.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project, according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of projects because a limited number of specific environmental impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

Its four main lines of business are wholesale banking, retail banking, insurance and related activities, as well as asset management. The bank serves over 13.5 million customers. The project is in response to Brazil''s need for trade finance at a time of global risk aversion and severe market illiquidity in Brazil. In this environment, fast-moving multilateral initiatives like the proposed TFF have an important role to play not only in providing needed financing to the country, but in buttressing investor sentiment for Brazil. The B Loan will allow international banks, that currently have trade-related exposure to Unibanco, to keep their lines outstanding to the bank, rather than withdrawing them due to short-term Brazil exposure concerns. Such a B Loan initiative would complement efforts on the part of Brazilian banks and the government to persuade international lenders to leave in place lines currently outstanding to Brazilian financial institutions.  The project would also be complementary to policy initiatives, reportedly being mulled by other multilaterals such as the IMF, to address the current severe pullback of bank lines to Brazil.","","","","","","","","","","","This is an  FI Type 1 project.

In April 2001, Mirant Corporation acquired majority ownership (80%) and operating control of the company through a competitive bidding process. On March 30, 2001, JPSCo was granted a 20-year exclusive license to provide electricity transmission and distribution services to customers throughout Jamaica. Since early 2001, the company has been forced to curtail load to customers due to limited generation reserves, and problems with a number of company owned power plants and independent power producers (IPPs).  As a result, the company has decided to build a new generation plant at a cost of US$127.5 MM,  and has requested IFC to provide US$45 million in debt financing for the project.IFCs involvement in the deal will help mobilize long-term financing from commercial lenders in a difficult market.  IFC''s long term financing is critical since, such financing is otherwise not available for Jamaica.  Moreover, IFC''s financial support to this newly privatized company could serve as a positive example in support of private participation in the infrastructure sector and catalyze further investments into the sector.The proposed project is of vital importance to Jamaica in terms of electricity supply as this plant will serve to meet current demand.  Capacity challenges led to a drop in the companys availability level to 79.7%, resulting in significant load shedding during February-September 2001.  At the peak of load shedding, over 50% of the island was affected.  Load shedding is still continuing throughout the country according to a rolling black-out schedule published by JPSCo.  With the new capacity added by this project, JPSCo will have sufficient generating capacity to meet the growing demand and the reliability requirements of the system for the next few years.  Moreover, the proposed project is the first combined cycle power plant in Jamaica which has a higher thermal efficiency and a lower generation cost than simple cycle plants. By locating the plant in the north, where the demand is growing rapidly, the company has estimated to save approximately US$10 million, which is the cost of building a new transmission line from South to North that otherwise would have been required to meet the demand.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected community- Company''s Administrative Office at Bogue Power Station, JPSCo, Bogue Industrial Estate, Montego Bay, Jamaica- Administrative Office, JPSCo, 6 Knutsford Boulevard, Kingston, Jamaica.","The project is a 120 MW combined cycle power plant sponsored by Jamaica Public Service company Limited (JPSCo, the company), as a part of its capacity expansion program.

By extending the duration of the maturities, IFC will also contribute to reducing this mismatch on the liabilities side.Davivienda expects to take additional provisions in the future to cover for market, operational, and legal risks according to new regulations from the Banking Superintendence which will be according to Basel II.The proposed tier two equity facility would be the first of its kind to be implemented in Colombia since the regulations were established in August 2001.

The fund offers an integrated package of risk capital and technical assistance to support community-based, commercially-viable economic activities that encourage the sustainable use of natural resources.  TNC established and incorporated a for-profit investment company, Fondo EcoEmpresas, S.A., in Panama, as the fund''s risk capital arm, to provide debt and equity financing to socially- and environmentally-responsible companies in Latin America and the Caribbean.  TNC serves as the fund manager for Fondo EcoEmpresas and is also the majority shareholder in the investment company.  In addition to helping defray costs of operating the investment company, EcoEnterprises Fund''s technical assistance component provides critical support in business and environmental advisory services, such as financial control and accounting, marketing, business planning, and biodiversity monitoring.All Fondo EcoEmpresas portfolio companies are required to work with local conservation or community organizations in order to ensure their activities help meet the needs of in-country social and environmental stakeholders.  Involvement by the local non-profit organization in the business may include equity interests; profit sharing; user licensing fees or royalties; flat rate resource concession fees; resource management fees, or some other form of financial involvement. NGOs may also provide an on-going environmental and social monitoring role.  By offering technical assistance to both the portfolio companies and their non-profit partners, EcoEnterprises Fund helps develop capacity for: integrating business and biodiversity objectives, building business acumen, and helping companies maximize their impact on biodiversity preservation.GEF funding of US$1 million will be dedicated to maximizing the long-term biodiversity benefits of EcoEnterprises Funds project portfolio, and helping to cover the higher annual operating costs that this will entail.  The higher operating costs will arise due to the need to provide extra business- and biodiversity-related technical assistance, and the need to provide extra fund management support to develop, manage and exit viable investments.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a category FI Type 2 project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedure.

Its mission is to preserve plants, animals, and natural communities that represent the diversity of life on Earth by protecting the lands and waters they need to survive.","The total project cost for the EcoEnterprises Fund (the fund) is US$10 million, of which the IFC-executed GEF portion comprises a US$1 million grant investment to The Nature Conservancy to support the fund''s technical assistance activities.  TNC operates as the fund manager of Fondo EcoEmpresas, S.A. and directs EcoEnterprises Fund''s technical assistance component.In order to ensure that the biodiversity benefits are maximized, US$550,000 of the grant funds will be used to underwrite the incremental costs of providing technical assistance on a project-by-project basis to businesses and local non-profit partners being supported by the fund''s risk capital arm, Fondo EcoEmpresas, S.A.The remaining US$450,000 in GEF support is being sought to help defray the incremental costs of operating a biodiversity-oriented fund.  Because the types of projects supported through EcoEnterprises Funds risk capital arm are community-oriented, smaller-sized, and involve emerging sectors, the investment process tends to require more creative participation and involves more difficult transactions than traditional investments. As a result, the incremental costs of operating EcoEnterprises Fund''s investment activities are expected to exceed those of a typical small enterprise fund.

Founded in early 1999 by Phil Tran, the company targets three business segments, namely computer and video games, web content and coding development, and 3D animation.  Glass Egg currently has 67 employees and carries out 100 percent of its development work in Vietnam.  The company is seeking up to US$3.0 million to expand its technical and managerial capacity in Vietnam, and to open a business development office in the United States.  Development ImpactsThe project would support efforts to catalyze growth and entrepreneurship in Vietnam by exporting high-end IT services, and also by acting as an important symbol of the benefits of continued reform.  The project would have significant developmental impact by creating highly skilled software development jobs in Vietnam over the next five years; and helping to train workers in Vietnam by exposing them to the global digital media industry.  Through an intensive home-grown training program, the project would bring higher standards of software services to Vietnam.  Finally, by helping Glass Egg develop a broader international client base, it would help put Vietnam on the map in the digital media outsourcing industry.IFC''s RoleAgainst the background of a downturn in the global technology sector, as well as the near total absence of venture capital money for Vietnamese companies, IFCs support for Glass Egg has been critical.  IFC has spent considerable time in structuring the transaction and in helping the company think through its strategy and operations in a difficult environment.  Given the difficulties experienced by many small Internet companies over the past two years, major global companies are reluctant to work with small start-ups, and IFC''s participation will increase Glass Egg''s credibility and help secure additional outsourcing contracts.  The company is emerging from a loss-making situation and hopes to turn profitable this year, and IFC''s investment will enable the company to scale up to reach its profitability goals.  In addition, while off-shore software programming is now well established for traditional software applications, digital media services from emerging markets are at a very nascent stage.

This project, which begins on July 1, 2003, extends the partnership program for three additional years.Partnership program:The objectives of the partnership are to: support the creation and growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); promote capital investment; and improve the business enabling environment.  The partnerships projects fall into four program areas:(1) Linkages: building supply and distribution chains; (2) building financial markets; (3) SME business support services and policy advice; (4) corporate governance.   IFC role:The formation of the partnership in June 2000 has since led to increased effectiveness, improved practices, and increased impact of IFCs technical assistance in the FSU.  While donor funding is used to finance specific programs in the former Soviet Union, IFC provides the administrative and managerial structure that supports project work.  The added value of the partnership includes:·	solid financial management and internal control systems;·	capacity to develop new programs;·	strong monitoring and evaluation;·	a communications strategy for the region;·	solid financial management and internal controls; and,·	a dedicated team of local and expatriate professionals supported by effective human resource management.Closer links with investment work:  The linkages with investment work are achieved through close cooperation with investment staff.  The partnership has a manager focused on projects in the financial sector, two managers working with a supply chain specialist focused on the real sector, one manager focused on agribusiness projects, and a fifth dedicated to corporate governance.  These staff work closely with their investment counterparts to develop projects that address obstacles to investment by IFC and other investors and/or link to an existing IFC investment to increase the development impact on the local community.  This has already proved successful in the leasing and dairy sectors, and new initiatives are underway in forestry, furniture, mining, shipbuilding, and paper products.Developmental impact:The impacts of the partnership on the private sector in its first two years have been significant:  ·	Establishment of long-term business relationships between local enterprises and foreign investors;·	Increased access to financing for SMEs, including credits, leasing finance, and direct investment;·	Improvements in the business enabling environment, in areas affecting agriculture, leasing, corporate governance, and general regulation of SMEs;·	More effective and sustainable local institutions, including business associations, providing SMEs with financial, advisory, and advocacy services; and,·	Improved protection of shareholders rights and corporate governance.  The partnership trains and consults local firms to strengthen their abilities to partner with foreign investors, particularly as suppliers.  This increases opportunities for local firms to grow, improves conditions for investment, and increases the development impact of existing investments, all to the benefit of local communities.  Many of these projects involve an IFC investment and substantially increase the development impact of IFCs financing.   An extension of the partnership will enable this work to continue, as well as allow it to develop new program areas.  Some possible areas are micro-finance and micro-leasing, housing finance, quality development for local manufacturers, alternate dispute resolution, corporate governance for the banking sector, and energy efficiency.","","","","","","","","","","",Category CLocation of environmental documents In locally affected community,"IFC and international donors.

Magadi Expansion Project,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Africa,Kenya,TATA CHEMICALS MAGADI LTD,"Gbl Ind, Manufact, Agribus & Services",2002-09-26T04:00:00Z,2002-10-31T05:00:00Z,B,Loan,"MSC is a Kenyan soda ash producer with 300,000 tpa of nominal capacity, and 2001 sales of $31 million.  Magadi is one of Kenya''s oldest companies, operating for about 85 years utilizing Lake Magadi''s trona to produce sodium carbonate (soda ash).  The venture, an expansion of an existing IFC-financed project, consists of the construction of a new plant and associated off-plot projects that would produce up to 365,000 tons annually of higher purity soda ash for export, primarily to the glass packaging sector in Magadi''s existing markets.  The new plant will be constructed over a  27-month period.  The existing plant would continue to operate at full capacity throughout project implementation, and, thereafter, produce about 75,000 tons annually of lower quality soda ash for about 5 to 10 years after the new plant initiates commercial operations.  To stay in business in the medium-to-longer term, Magadi needs to implement this project.  Its existing lower-grade soda ash product will face shrinking  markets as demand shifts to higher purity soda ash.  Without this project, Kenya will lose one of its most important exports and leave unutilized a valuable renewable natural resource - the trona reserves in Lake Magadi.   Moreover, the closure of the company''s operation in a remote part of Kenya would leave the surrounding community without basic life-sustaining services and development.The project has a strong development impact.  First of all, Magadi provides direct permanent employment to about 400 people and temporary employment to another 100.  At its peak, the construction of the project would require about 350 additional employees.  Secondly, the company is an integral part of the local Maasai community, helping it to cope with depressed economic conditions and develop socially and economically.  Magadi provides health, water, education, and transportation services to the township and promotes entrepreneurship among the community members.  The company maintains a hospital, three primary schools and one secondary school, housing for employees, teachers and medical personnel and an 86 km road to Magadi.  It has contracted out cleaning services to the local community. It has reserved 40% of the stalls in the public market for locals. It is exploring business opportunities in tourism and ways of diversifying  income sources, away from livestock raising into bee-keeping and maize mills - especially for local women.  Thirdly, Magadi is an important foreign exchange earner for Kenya.   Finally, the project will upgrade the environmental standards of the existing operation, particularly with respect to the reduction of dust levels at the Mombasa terminal.The proposed investment follows from an IFC review of the technical, commercial and financial aspects of a project undertaken in 2000 at the request of the company.  On the technical side, IFC has played an important role in reviewing the development of the production process for improved purity ash, its capital costs, project management structure and arrangements, operating costs, marketing arrangements, and environmental and supply chain aspects.   Moreover, IFC has helped ensure that the proposed improvement of environmental standards of the existing operation, particularly with respect to the reduction of dust levels at the Mombasa terminal, was incorporated in the Environmental Action Plan for the project.  Finally, IFC has played a significant role in developing a bankable financial plan and in helping Magadi, a middle-tier company, raise both term loans and quasi-equity from international financial institutions.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityThe ERS will be made available locally at the Magadi District''s Officer''s Office and the company''s Offices at Magadi.

Due to its small size and privately owned status, ACB has been less inclined to focus on Vietnam''s larger, government-backed state-owned enterprises and has largely directed its efforts towards the consumer and small business markets.  Innovation, progressiveness and a motive for profit (not always evident amongst the dominant state-owned banks), has helped ACB grow successfully. ACB has 19 offices and over 900 staff (of which 75% have post-secondary education), mostly based in HCMC.  It was the first Vietnamese private sector bank to obtain licenses for MasterCard issuance and settlement.  Today, ACB  operates a card center in HCMC which issues both domestic and international credit cards.  ACB has also been retained by Western Union as its money transfer agent and operates four transactions centers with 411 agents and 187 payment points in 52 provinces and towns nationwide. As evidenced by similar banks in other developing markets of the region, this retail focus of ACB''s should place it in good stead as Vietnam''s economy continues to grow.Project RationaleAs one of IFC''s first investments in the Vietnamese banking sector, this project represents a good opportunity for IFC to assist the emerging private sector.  Successful implementation of this project would provide IFC with an ideal platform to make future investments in the financial sector, and to make an impact on the reform and modernization of Vietnams banking sector, leading to further opening of the sector to private competition.Furthermore, this project responds to ACBs request for IFC''s participation because of IFC''s global expertise in financial sector development and reputation for promoting best practice in corporate governance.   Established in 1993, after the deregulation of the banking sector and its opening up to private sector participants, ACB has emerged as the leading private sector joint-stock bank in Vietnam.  Given its national reach and presence, ACB represents a unique opportunity for IFC to make an impact on the development of the Vietnamese financial sector.  Through on-going supervision and Board participation, IFC will be able to continue to introduce financial discipline and international best practices, and help build ACB into a first-class modern bank in Vietnam.  IFCs equity investment would promote confidence in private sector joint-stock banks, and encourage the authorities to further open up the financial sector to private and foreign participation.  IFC RoleGovernance and managerial capacity are the main constraint for small banks to grow and develop in a sustainable fashion.  In addition to providing equity capital, IFCs key contribution to ACB''s growth is expected to be in the area of corporate governance and credit management capacity as in particular in the fast growing housing finance portfolio.  By taking an equity stake in ACB, IFC will support the modernization, strengthening and proposed listing of the bank. IFCs presence in this project will also provide an opportunity to respond to the State Bank of Vietnam''s request for assistance with the strengthening of private sector commercial banks.Developmental ImpactThe main priority for Vietnams financial sector is to enlarge the participation of private sector banks.  Development of private financial institutions is a precondition for improving the access of private companies to bank financing and is therefore an important factor for promoting sustainable growth. The emergence of large private financial institutions is expected to increase competition in the banking industry and challenge the dominance of the state banks. This project will help one of the best private commercial banks in Vietnam to grow and emerge as a significant player in the domestic financial sector. Indirectly, it will enhance the access of Vietnamese private companies to bank financing, and will introduce more competition in the banking industry.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Financial Intermediary (FI) Type 1 project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure.

Under the concession contract, APSA will abstract water from Lake Gatun, treat it and deliver an agreed daily volume of potable water (varying between 15 and 20 million gallons per day MGD) into the existing distribution system at Nuevo Chorrillo.  The delivery point is located on the west bank of the Panama Canal approximately 20 kilometers from Panama City.  The construction of the water treatment plant was completed in June 2002 and a partial acceptance certificate was issued by IDAAN at that time.  The plant was fully completed in September 2002, with a total project cost of $25 million.  

The contract, which provides APSA with a 30 year concession period, specifies that the company will deliver to IDAAN a minimum daily bulk volume of potable water into Nuevo Chorrillo, which serves the west bank of the Panama Canal including the urban areas of Arraijan, Chorrera and Capira.  In consideration of its service, APSA will receive a monthly payment calculated on the basis of the agreed volumes of water delivered and a base unit price of $0.8942/1000 US gallons, adjustable at regular intervals by an agreed price escalation factor.  The towns of Arraijan, Chorrera and Capira served by the Nuevo Chorrillo water supply system are facing an acute water shortage due to the inability of the offtaker IDAAN to produce sufficient water to supply the population in these areas, which totals 270,000 people.  The APSA project will provide potable water into the distribution system increasing supply to these areas, which at present have no viable alternative. Thus the project will have a high development impact by improving the living conditions of the population in these towns.

The objective of establishing SIBFI is to help meet the strong and rapidly growing needs in China for acquiring international best practices in banking and finance.  This investment will demonstrate IFCs continued support of the development of Chinas banking industry.  To date the Corporation has invested in two Chinese banks, with two more investments near completion.  In addition, IFC has been providing a variety of technical assistance (TA) and training activities to selected Chinese banks.  The proposed project will institutionalize banking training on a sustainable and commercially viable basis.  The establishment of SIBFI is very timely, as Chinas WTO membership and the expected increase in banking competition have brought about a surge in the demand for training among Chinese banks.  There are currently various training activities and initiatives taking place in China, but SIBFI will be the most reputable and professional international training institution.  Therefore, this project is expected to have a very strong demonstration and developmental impact.IFC is playing a critical role in this project.  It was IFC which brought together two separate initiatives undertaken by Bankakademie on the one hand, and PCBS and SUFE on the other, and combined the two initiatives to work towards a common goal.  Through our experience in investing in and providing TA to Chinese banks, IFC has established a good reputation and expertise which are viewed as very important by all other partners of this project.  IFC will not only play an important role in setting up SIBFI, but will also play an active role in the strategic development of SIBFI through our director on the board of SIBFI.  The establishment of SIBFI will also leverage and enhance the ongoing TA and training activities of IFC and the World Bank in China.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a category C project under IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.

Developmental Impact
It is expected that the fund will generally provide capital to established and profitable companies in order to expand capacity and develop as a potential market leader.  Aside from providing scarce equity capital, QCR will add value to the investees by helping the companies to professionalize their corporate structures, implement appropriate management and financial accounting systems, and also create strategic linkages with Western European and other Russian companies.

IFC Role:
IFC has three important roles to play in the fund:

As an anchor investor, IFC will play a catalytic role in attracting other investors to the fund.  Institutional investors are typically wary of investments outside the Moscow area, particularly for smaller and medium sized local companies.  QCR believes that IFC's participation as an anchor investor and as a member of the Advisory Board and observer on the Investment Committee would be crucial in order to encourage commercial investors to broaden their investment horizons into Russia's regions.

IFC's involvement in reviewing transaction opportunities from an early stage will be crucial in assessing the availability of loan finance for potential investees.  In this capacity, IFC will play a key role in mobilizing longer-term loan finance for mid-sector Russian companies, which is scarce in Russia, particularly for companies outside the Moscow region.

IFC's work on corporate governance issues in Russia has provided the corporation with specific insights into some of the more widespread governance problems in Russia.  As improving the governance standards of investee companies will be one of the Fund's objectives, the fund manager will be able to draw on IFC's expertise through interaction with IFC on the Advisory Board and at the Investment Committee.

Astra International is one of the largest automotive business in Indonesia.  The company also has interests in financial services, agribusiness and heavy equipment.  The $150 million rights issue will complement Astra's recently scheduled comprehensive debt restructuring plan which will be approved on November 26, 2002. The plan aims to: establish an achievable debt amortization schedule, and an appropriate and sustainable capital structure; and  provide funding flexibility to support Astra's operations and business development.

Development Impact
Indonesia is lagging other Asian crisis countries in its corporate restructuring efforts. The project is part of the financial restructuring of one of the leading Indonesian private sector corporates and as such is expected to have a strong demonstration effect on the restructuring of the corporate sector in the country.  The venture will help Astra, which employs over 56,000 people, to be more competitive by enabling it to: strengthen its balance sheet; undertake needed investments in modernizing and expanding its automotive distribution/dealership business to further enhance customer service and productivity in a competitive and increasingly liberalized industry.  The proposed rights issue would be marketed extensively to institutional investors in the US and in Europe and would help to re-introduce Indonesia and Astra to these markets.

IFC Role
because of its strong, long-standing relationship with Astra and its reputation as an independent investor, IFC has been invited by C&C/Jardines to be a stand-by investor for unsubscribed rights. IFC involvement should help ensure success of the rights issue in the current uncertain economic and political climate and send a strong signal to the investment community that IFC is supportive of first-class companies in Indonesia with good corporate governance and environmental performance.

Ro-Fin Mortgage Loan Company,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,Romania,DOMENIA CREDIT IFN SA,Regional Industry - FIG - ECA,2002-11-22T05:00:00Z,2003-01-15T05:00:00Z,C,Loan,"RAEF is in the process of establishing Ro-Fin Mortgage Loan Company (Ro-Fin, or the company), a green-field entity, as a specialized housing finance company to originate and service primary mortgages to Romanian households. Ro-Fin will be capitalized with equity and long-term debt at $36 million (ROL 1,200 billion equivalent) making it the first significant private mortgage company in Romania. The strong capitalization would enable the company to mobilize ample funds internally and externally at attractive rates and offer affordable residential mortgages in Romania. The proceeds from IFC's long-term loan will be on-lent as long-term residential mortgages and home refurbishing sub-loans that are very scarce products in the Romanian market. The company will be chaired by an experienced, senior mortgage banker.Development Impact:Mortgages are virtually nonexistent in Romania.  An important developmental impact of this project is to provide critically needed long-term funding to families that wish to own their home. The tenor of IFC's loan would enable Ro-Fin to provide long-term, and thus, more affordable mortgage credits. With the increased affordability, more individuals could access funding to purchase new or renovate existing homes, thus addressing the poor condition housing in Romania. Further, through extensive linkage effects, the housing industry will contribute to the development of SMEs that supply labor and materials for the construction and improvement of homes; a major contributor to economic growth in Romania. It is further envisaged that the project would have a powerful demonstration effect in stimulating other market players to augment their underwriting standards, laying the foundation for a sound and thriving secondary market for issuing mortgage-backed securities.IFC Role:IFC will play a major role in ensuring that the underlying mortgages are structured using best practice underwriting and mortgage servicing standards.  Documentation and mortgage requirements for sub-loans will be based on standardized underwriting criteria to facilitate securitization. The objective of this project will be to spur the growth of the primary residential mortgage market, with a view to developing the secondary market through securitization and the creation of an active refinancing entity.

In order to counteract the local prevailing environment, Molinos changed its sales mix and increased its exports from 25% of sales in FY2001 to 47% in 1H02 and expects to close FY2002 with over 50% exports.  To assist Molinos overcome short-term capital constraints and increase exports to the envisaged levels, IFC intends to structure a short-term, pre-export finance, export receivables-backed facility. The facility will be renewable annually for a maximum of three years.

Developmental Impact:
The project is designed to alleviate the immediate constraints faced by the oilseeds sector in Argentina and to help maintain its competitiveness in the face of a remunerative world market but a very volatile political, social, and economic environment.  The following benefits are expected from the project:
Financing the marketing of the 2003 crop (soybean, sunflower, and wheat aimed at the export market.)  The proposed project will enable Molinos to leverage its export receivables and extend financing to farmers.  
Preserving the supply chain  Molinos's strategy has been to position itself as one of the primary originators of oilseeds and grains in Argentina to compete with global traders who are able to leverage their considerable network of export destinations worldwide.  The venture will enable Molinos to secure its grains and oilseed procurement to satisfy both the internal and export markets.  
Demonstration impact  IFC's support to the Argentine grain/oilseed supply chain is expected to send a signal to foreign financial institutions to focus their attention on the true nature of the credit risk in these operations.  This may lead to an increased appetite by foreign banks to increase their exposure to the better corporates -- something essential for Argentina to move towards an export-led recovery.

IFC Role:
IFC's participation in the proposed project will: 
provide capital not accessible today from the markets and enhance the operational and financial sustainability of a major domestic agro-exporter; 
ensure the participation of foreign banks through a B-Loan under a challenging country scenario; and

It has approximately 9,300 students, 1000 professors, and offers 31 undergraduate degrees and 25 graduate programs (master's degree, post-graduate degree, executive programs and diplomas) within 8 faculties.  In addition, it conducts research in multiple areas funded, in part, by top international granting agencies (e.g. Ford Foundation, Fulbright Commission, UNESCO, etc.)  The university interacts with over 80 foreign universities through agreements and has received more than 200 foreign students.

The project consists of the construction and refurbishment of campus buildings.  UDP will follow new building regulations being proposed by the Municipality to help preserve the district's heritage and traditional architecture.  UDP's aim is to create a fully integrated 'urban campus' that will link and standardize its faculty buildings. The project includes the construction of three new university buildings and the refurbishment/expansion of six existing sites.  It will cover approximately 50,000 sq.m. (including new construction and refurbishment).  Implementation is planned to begin in April 2003 and last approximately 20 months.

According to the same objectives, UDP is actively participating in a public-private partnership called 'BUS'  (Barrio Universitario de Santiago, Santiago's University District) that intends to refurbish public space, squares, pedestrian walks, in order to improve the living standards in this area. The main partners (UDP, the Municipality and several educational institutions as universities, schools and technical institutes located in the area) have signed an agreement that defines the priorities and establishes an image of what the district should be in the next years. 

One of the university's defining characteristics is its pluralism and commitment to the exchange of ideas from all parts of society.  The project will help foster links with the neighborhood (through a common auditorium, library, and cafeteria open to the public).  Also, the bond issuance itself is an important signal to the market of UDP's progressiveness and outwardness.  Both the project and the bond will solidify UDP's brand and better position vis-a-vis competition.  Also, the additional space will allow UDP to increase its student enrollment proportionately with the Ministry of Educations projections for the increase in demand for higher education over the next decade.

IFC will be assisting a successful private university to innovatively raise capital for its diversification and expansion through a local bond issue.  It will build the university's investor base.  This structuring is the first for a higher education project undertaken by IFC and the first of its kind in Latin America region.  Also, it is expected to be among the first future cash flow securitizations in Chile.  It can provide a demonstration model for replication elsewhere.  IFC's credit enhancement will be essential for the bond to reach the AA- rating needed to attract institutional investors and, in turn, will allow local institutional investors to diversify their investment holdings into an as of yet untapped sector.

To assist the company overcome its short-term capital constraints, IFC intends to structure a short-term, pre-export finance, export receivables-backed facility. The facility will be renewable annually for a maximum of three years.Developmental Impact:The project is designed to alleviate the immediate constraints faced by the oilseeds sector in Argentina and to help maintain its competitiveness in the face of a remunerative world market but a very volatile political, social, and economic environment.  More specifically the project is expected to:- Support Argentine farmers:  Following the economic and financial crisis, farmers have expanded their production of oilseeds at the expense of other crops such as grains, as the former generally use fewer inputs, their trade is more oriented toward export, and crushing margins on the world market are currently favorable and support higher prices for oilseeds. Official forecasts are that areas sown with soybeans and sunflower will expand by 8% and 15% respectively in 2002/03, which could result in the largest oilseed harvest in history with the 2003 crop of soybeans currently forecast at 32.5m metric tons. This is likely to put significant stress on the physical and financial infrastructure required for an orderly marketing of the crop. The proposed project would alleviate some of the anticipated constraints in the financing of this record crop - Preserve the supply chain  Vicentin is one of the primary originators of oilseeds in Argentina. Unlike global traders who can leverage their considerable network of export destinations worldwide and retain an access to external financing resources, domestic companies have been severely constrained in their ability to raise external financing because of the perceived country risk. The proposed project intends to increase liquidity in the established supply chain, preserve its integrity and the associated social fabric, which includes numerous participants in the countryside -- farmers, input suppliers, independent storage operators, transporters, brokers and traders -- as well as their dependents.Demonstration impactSupport to the Argentine grain/oilseed supply chain by IFC and some of the most respected foreign banks in commodity finance is expected to send a strong signal to foreign financial institutions, focusing their attention on the true nature of the credit risk in these operations by disaggregating the business risk from the sovereign risk. It is expected to result in an increased appetite to raise exposure to the better risks in export-oriented Argentine companies.IFC Role:IFCs participation in the proposed project will: provide capital not accessible today from the markets and enhance the operational and financial sustainability of a major domestic agro-exporter; ensure the participation of foreign banks through a B-Loan under a challenging country scenario; and protect an existing IFC investment.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category C project, according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because it is likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts.Location of environmental documents In locally affected community","Vicentin is Argentinas second leading family owned oilseed processor and exporter company.

The development program will entail drilling and completion of 17 wells, the construction of an offshore platform and installation of subsea equipment.  The Surat project involves the drilling of up to 15 development wells and installation of tie-in pipelines to a nearby national grid.  Promoting development of domestic gas resources:  The project will contribute to developing India''s scarce domestic gas reserves. India is the world''s sixth largest energy consumer, but is strongly deficit in oil and gas. While the country''s consumption of natural gas has risen faster than any other fuel in recent years, natural gas still contributes to less than 10% of India''s total energy consumption. In the absence of major new sources, total domestic gas production is forecast to sharply decline over the coming decade.Enhancing availability of a cheaper and clean fuel: Gujarat''s power sector is strongly dependent on more expensive naphtha supplies or relatively inferior coal brought from India''s central and eastern states. The project will strengthen availability of locally produced gas as fuel for power generation, city gas distribution, and for small industry. In addition to lower cost, increasing availability of gas offers advantages of promoting use of a more clean and convenient fuel in the state.  Promoting private sector participation:  Since the early nineties, India has implemented strong policy changes to encourage private and foreign investment in its E&P sector. Although success remains moderate, a number of small local and foreign companies such as Niko have successfully entered the sector and seek to grow their operations. IFC''s investment in this project will help support a growing private sector role in the upstream hydrocarbons sector.

Dataquest specializes in 2D cell animation production and post-production for TV and feature films.  It was founded in 1987 by Mr. Tapaas Chakravarti to undertake international business consulting.  During 2000/2001, earlier operations were discontinued and the company focused on setting up the infrastructure needed to establish its animation business.

Project Overview
The proposed investment will build up the company's execution process and boost co-production contracts from leading European and North American animation firms.  By 2004, Dataquest plans to have 
- doubled its staff
- increased its investment in 2D infrastructure
- developed 3D infrastructure, and 
- created intellectual property rights (IPR).

Development Impact
The project will have strong developmental impact in the following areas:

Employment creation.  India's domestic animation market is nascent because of lack of highly skilled animation professionals and intellectual property rights.  Dataquest plans to expand its staff from 300 today to over 750 by year-end 2004.  
Training.  The company has established its own school that trains staff in state-of-the-art animation production.  
Demonstration effect.  A successful investment in Dataquest will help to attract more foreign capital to the information technology (IT) sector in India.  The current conditions in the equity markets are difficult, and IFC's investment will likely lead to further financing opportunities for Dataquest itself, as well as help generate interest in other Indian IT ventures. 

IFC Role
An IFC investment at this time will be beneficial to the company in several ways:

The downturn in the global technology sector and the subsequent slowing of technology-related investments by equity finds has made it difficult for companies such as Dataquest to raise capital.  IFC's investment will help close the financing gap.
IFC's presence would lend additional credibility to the company, and help it attract other investors in future rounds of financing.
Due to the global nature of the animation business, IFC's international experience and perspective would be valuable to the company going forward.

The project would provide logistics support for the development of the sector and also positively impact the growth of trade and industry through increased traffic flows and greater accessibility to the country and the region. A strengthened airline industry could also benefit job creation and retention, with travel and tourism employment currently represents almost 8% of the country's total employment.

Bradesco TF,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Brazil,Banco Bradesco S/A.,Regional Industry - FIG LAC,2002-12-23T05:00:00Z,2003-01-24T05:00:00Z,C,Loan,"Bradesco provides a comprehensive range of retail as well as wholesale financial products and services directly or through subsidiaries to 13 million clients, serviced by a network of 2,928 branches (figures as of September 30, 2002). 
The TFF transactions have been successful in convincing international banks with existing credit line authorizations to Brazilian banks to re-extend trade funding that had been withdrawn since earlier this year. Also, in many cases, lenders were able to ""swap"" upcoming maturities under existing trade finance facilities to Brazilian banks into the B loan structures afforded by these transactions  thereby locking in 12-month funding for the Brazilian banks that might have been withdrawn in the near future in the absence of the initiative. B Loan tranches have also included several ""new money"" commitments from international lenders that did not have existing credit exposures to the relevant Brazilian banks. 
The TFF transactions have demonstrated that the B loan structure is extremely effective in helping to address short-term Brazil country exposure concerns of international banks for an intrinsically low-risk asset class such as trade finance, and in complementing efforts on the part of the Brazilian government to persuade international lenders to leave in place credit lines currently outstanding to Brazilian financial institutions. 
IFC's role in the proposed Bradesco transaction is three-fold: (1) providing funds directly to Bradesco; mobilizing funding from commercial lenders into the B loan structure, which has (a) recently been withdrawn, (b) would likely be pulled in the near future, and/or (c) has an existing tenor which is extremely short by historical standards, and (3) making possible the participation of another multilateral institution in an A loan to Bradesco.

With equity funding from ZG, ADC subsequently acquired a pig farm and an 82% stake in a feed mill. IFC will be funding the next phase of the venture that will complete the integration of ADCs pig breeding operations.  The project, to be implemented over five years, will introduce improved slaughter pigs in the Jilin market, and fresh and processed pork products in the Jilin province.  US-based PIC (recently renamed Sygen International plc.) is ADCs technical partner responsible for providing the genetic stock and technical support to breed improved pigs.  The PIC pigs yield up to 25% more meat than local breeds and have higher feed-to-meat conversion ratios.  The proposed venture involves the establishment of eleven pig breeding farms, a processing plant and the acquisition an existing slaughterhouse. In addition to the assets already acquired. Development ImpactUpon completion, the project will favorably impact more than 10,000 farmers in Jilin province.  They will earn higher incomes derived from productivity gains associated with breeding the improved pigs supplied by ADC.  Feed cost savings to the pig breeding industry is estimated at $15 million per annum.  These savings will eventually be captured by the end-consumer.  Farmers will also benefit from technical support from PIC and ADC as well as from insights to modern pig breeding techniques.  The project will be a major source of employment via the creation of 1,200 jobs.  The workers will earn approximately 33% above their present wages.  In addition, ADC will be undertaking many activities previously done by less efficient and financially impaired SOEs, and in so ding  it will promote more efficient allocation of resources.  The investment objectives are in-line with the provincial governments efforts to develop the pig-breeding and corn industries, two priority sectors for Jilin province, considered the grain bowl of China.

In regions where tourism is a significant economic sector, large turnovers of short term visitors and seasonal residents call for a specifically adapted healthcare delivery model, which was successfully developed by Hospiten in Spain. Hospiten is now exporting this model to the Dominican Republic and Mexico.The facilities established by Hospiten in the Dominican Republic and in Mexico will both assist in the development of the tourism industries as well as provide much needed quality health care to the local population.   - Support the tourism industry: The provision of quality health care is an essential service needed for the development of the tourism industry. For developing countries to be competitive in this sector, health services should be comparable to those of industrialized countries. Tourism is a major contributor to the economies of Dominican Republic and Quintana Roo, with the majority of tourists coming from the United States and Europe. The new Hospiten facilities in Cancún and Riviera Maya will provide high quality medical care to such tourists, helping to ensure the perception of these areas as safe destinations for vacationers and business travelers. This perception may become even more vital, as several new, upscale hotel projects are being planned. Hospiten Santo Domingo will also have a positive effect on tourism, as approximately 20% of its clients will be tourists, in part referred from the existing Bávaro hospital.  - Improve local health care: Hospiten Santo Domingo will serve predominantly the local population, and as such will expand access to high quality health care in the capital city. The public health system in Dominican Republic suffers from serious systemic problems, including inadequate financing, low coverage, an emphasis on curative care, redundant and overused facilities, and inefficiencies. As a result, general healthcare provision is poor, as reflected in the countrys weak health indicators. In addition to providing much-needed quality services, Hospiten Santo Domingo would also bring state-of-the-art technologies and management practices to the capital, thus demonstrating best practices to other public and private providers. IFC plays essentially two roles in this project: as a financier, and as an adviser on operational best practice.  From the financiers perspective, IFC would provide appropriately structured long term financing, thereby enabling Hospiten to implement its project and maximize its chances of success. In the process, IFC is also assisting Hospiten in its efforts to diversify its sources of funding by approaching banks to place the new B loan. Finally, IFCs project appraisal and subsequent project supervision and reporting requirements supports Hospitens shareholders current efforts to rationalize corporate decision making process and strengthen internal controls.  IFCs involvement is also encouraging the company to further focus on environment, social and operational issues to improve its environmental consciousness and clinical outcomes.

IFC's investment in MFBM is expected to yield a strong developmental impact -- in terms of business growth, employment generation, confidence-building in the banking sector, and the introduction of commercially-oriented microfinance techniques to Macedonia.  The establishment of a professionally-managed, reputable bank in Macedonia is particularly important in light of the weakness of the majority of Macedonia's private banks and the lack of public trust in the banking system.  In addition to poverty reduction and related impact within the MSE target group, IFC's involvement in MFBM is also expected to:
Encourage replication of commercially-oriented microfinance institutions (MFIs) in the market and downscaling by existing commercial banks to serve MSEs;
Generate spill-over benefits in the form of trained managers and employees available to other local FIs; and,
Mobilize MSE savings, although this will not be the Bank's initial focus.

The company's goal is to grow its loan portfolio over the next five years by offering standardized loans to creditworthy individuals in India for purchasing or remodeling their homes.  The biggest constraint to achieving this goal is access to long-term funding at reasonable rates.  Through its proposed loan, IFC will: 
- strengthen DHFL's balance sheet by helping the company meet their funding needs with limited interest rate and maturity mismatches; 
- help semi-urban and rural borrowers obtain cost effective home financing; and 
- support the expansion of the successful Indian HFC model.  

Development Impact
A significant development impact of this project is the extension of housing finance to, and therefore an opportunity of home ownership for, lower-income and semi-urban borrowers, who are currently underserved by lending institutions.  Further, through extensive linkage effects, the housing industry will contribute to the development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that supply labor and materials for the construction and improvement of homes.  Currently, the housing finance sector is a major contributor to economic growth in India.  In the case of DHFL, increased home ownership by lower-income borrowers will help boost housing-related industries in the semi-urban regions.

IFC Role
Despite significant improvements in the supply of housing finance, India continues to face serious deficiencies in meeting the housing needs of its rapidly growing urban households.  As a result, in the next several decades, India will require massive investments in the housing sector.  Some of the major constraints that are limiting the availability of housing finance result from two critical factors: a shortage of strong, credible, and well capitalized players; and a lack of adequate funding, in maturity, structure and volume required for housing finance.  IFC will address the first constraint by investing in a second-tier institution with a focus on particular market segments, including underserved semi-urban areas and lower income borrowers.  The second constraint, i.e. availability of term financing, is being addressed by making available long-term, local currency funds to appropriately finance DHFL's mortgage assets and improve asset-liability management.  Funding of this type is currently unavailable to the company in the local market.

Birla Home Finance,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,South Asia,India,First Blue Home Finance Limited,Regional Industry - FIG Asia & Pac,2003-01-07T05:00:00Z,2003-02-08T05:00:00Z,C,Loan,"Originally incorporated as ITC Classic Home Finance in 1995, BHF was taken over by the Birla Group in 1999, through its fertilizer company, Chambal Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited. In September 2000, BHF became a 50/50 joint venture between Chambal Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited and BHW Holding AG. Owing to its strong sponsor support, BHFs profile has changed considerably since its reformation as a joint venture. The sponsors have injected additional capital into the company over the past twelve months. As a result, BHF''s net worth increased from approximately $12 million to $23 million. This increase will place BHF in the top tier in terms of capitalization among the housing finance companies in India. Similarly, BHFs loan portfolio grew by more than 200% in the last fiscal year and by an additional 34% in the first half of current year.  BHFs goal is to be a recognized leader in the Housing Finance Market in India in the next 5 to 10 years.Purpose of Project:  The project will facilitate the expansion of BHF mortgage loans to creditworthy clients that are constructing, acquiring and improving of residential properties. The IFC loan will: - strengthen BHF''s balance sheet by augmenting critical long term funding available to the company;- support BHF''s initiative to introduce new mortgage products into what has thus far been a ""plain vanilla"" mortgage market and to expand portfolio, and - support the expansion of strong private sector housing finance companies so as to offer borrowers credible alternatives to market leaders. IFC will also encourage BHF to endeavor to develop a portfolio of conforming, standardized mortgages with a view to securitizing its assets once the market for MBS has been firmly established.Development Impact: A significant development impact is the extension of housing finance to, and therefore an opportunity of home ownership for, lower-income households in semi-urban and urban areas. This segment, which BHF focuses on, has had limited access to credit, particularly in the semi-urban areas. The tenor of IFC''s loan would enable BHF to provide long-term, and thus, more affordable mortgage credits. With the increased affordability, more individuals could access funding to purchase homes or renovate their existing dwellings, thus addressing the poor condition and shortage of housing in India. Further, through extensive linkage effects, the housing industry will contribute to the development of SMEs that supply labor and materials for the construction and improvement of homes, a major contributor to economic growth in India. In the case of BHF, increased home ownership by lower-income borrowers will help boost housing-related industries in the semi-urban regions. IFC Role: Despite significant improvements in the supply of housing finance, India continues to face serious deficiencies in meeting the housing needs of its rapidly growing urban and semi-urban households. As a result, in the next several decades, India will require massive investments in the housing sector. Some of the major constraints that are limiting the availability of housing finance result from three critical factors: very few strong, credible, and well capitalized players; absence of adequate funds in maturity, structure and volume required for housing finance; and very limited reach of the lenders outside the major urban centers, specially in the semi-urban and rural areas where shortage of both housing and finance is most acute.   IFC will address the first constraint by investing in the building of a well capitalized institution to become a meaningful player in India''s housing finance sector. By providing a long-term, local currency loan to the company, IFC will play significant role in making available the scarce and critically needed term funding for the company to appropriately fund its mortgage assets and improve asset-liability management. Additionally, IFC''s emphasis on making BHF''s operations ""securitization friendly"" will give the company a head-start in tapping institutional funds through securitization.  Finally, IFC will support the extension of housing finance to the underserved households by working with a company that has a strategy which addresses the needs of the least served segment of the market, namely the semi-urban and rural areas where the shortage of housing is most severe.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category C project according to IFCs procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because it is likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts.Location of environmental documents In locally affected community","The sponsors of Birla Home Finance Limited (BHF, or the company) are the K.K.

Kalahari Diamond,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Africa,Botswana,PETRA DIAMONDS LIMITED,Energy & Mining - Global Infra,2003-01-08T05:00:00Z,2003-02-13T05:00:00Z,B,Equity,"KDL is a recently incorporated private UK company and will conduct operations through Godi (Proprietary) Limited, its wholly owned Botswana subsidiary. KDL will undertake a major review of existing geological information for the 90 licenses with a view to prioritizing and ranking areas that are considered more prospective.  BHPB's proprietary airborne Falcon Technology will be utilized to conduct aerial surveys of these areas.  If high priority target areas are identified, KDL will follow up with ground geophysics and sampling techniques.  Confirmed anomalies will be drill tested to recover samples for assessment of diamond potential.

Development Impact
Botswana's rapid and consistent economic development and high growth rate has been based on the re-investment of its mineral wealth in education, health, and sustainable economic development initiatives.  Although Botswana has a stable and democratic government and policies consistent with private sector development, exploration expenditure in Botswana is inconsistent with its diamond mineral potential.  In 2001, diamond exploration expenditure in Botswana was only $4.5 million, compared to $17 million in Australia, and $81 million in Canada.  This is partly due to the extensive sand cover renders exploration difficult.  Botswana's ability to continue their impressive development performance will be facilitated by new mine developments.  The formation of KDL and the introduction of the Falcon technology provide a step towards this objective.

The use of the airborne Falcon gravity gradiometer system will enable KDL to rapidly, with minimal environmental impact, obtain enhanced geological information on Botswana, including geological detail below the Kalahari sand cover that blankest about 70% of Botswana. The data collected will provide an enhanced understanding of Botswana's geological potential, and some of the data will be released to the Botswana Government as prospecting licenses are released.  KDL is willing to make available any relevant data to the Botswana Government and IFC assistance has been requested to develop, in consultation with KDL and Government, appropriate mechanisms for dissemination and utilization of the Falcon data beyond its mineral application.

IFC's involvement will assist in making KDL a leader in sustainable mining development initiatives.  IFC will have a positive role assisting mine development, facilitating community partnerships, local economic development, skills transfer, building environmental management capacity, and encouraging appropriate resource utilization and conservation practices (especially associated with game reserves).

The aerial exploration work utilizing the Falcon system is an airborne system and environmental impacts will be minimal.  During any subsequent ground exploration, environmental issues would be limited and associated with drilling of identified targets, water resources and water quality, habitat and ecology, solid and liquid waste management, vehicle impacts on desert environments, handling, use and storage of  fuel and reclamation of exploration areas.  Social issues include minimization of induced development, influx management and possible impacts on indigenous communities.  These impacts can be minimized and mitigated with careful management.The key environmental and social issue is that approximately one third of the exploration license areas lie within the Central Kalahari and Khutse Game Reserves that are managed conservation areas with an associated indigenous population of San Bushmen.  The Botswana Government views the Game Reserves as areas in which mine exploration and development is allowable alongside conservation initiatives under strict conditions.   For any prospecting in these areas, KDL will implement Government of Botswana guidelines associated with  Prospecting in the Central Kalahari and Khutse Game Reserves as well as applicable World Bank Policies and Guidelines.  Any future mine development resulting from KDLs activities would be evaluated as a new project with a new environmental classification appropriate to its impacts.  The company will then prepare a comprehensive Environmental and Social Impacts Assessment (ESIA) and Environmental Management Action Plan and undertake appropriate public disclosure and consultation. For any mine development, KDL has committed to achieve better than international best environmental practice and to ensure that project positive benefits outweigh negative impacts.  IFC will play a positive role in ensuring that this occurs by for example, facilitating community partnerships and local economic development, building and/or monitoring environmental management capacity including that associated with resource utilization and conservation within the Game Reserves.

EBA will have two main groups of products: instalment loans and other banking services, including current and savings accounts (in Kwanzas and in USD) and national and international payment services. EBA will provide loans of between $100 and $50,000, to finance fixed assets and working capital of micro enterprises and small businesses.IFC is a leader in Microfinance: IFC''s experience over a range of microfinance projects has shown that establishment of a specialized financial institution dedicated to microfinance provides a focused and efficient means of reaching the SME target group.  Due to the small size of typical microfinance banks, streamlined credit evaluation procedures and appropriately tailored MIS and micro-loan monitoring technologies can be put in place quickly.  High efficiency levels for SME lending are therefore achieved in a relatively short timeframe.

Efficient intermediation of capital into productive investments is vital to the restructuring and the future growth of Indonesia.  With a limited number of alternative intermediaries, the banking sector has a significant role to play.  By investing in the capital of BBI, IFC will be supporting the modernization and growth of an intermediary that has the opportunity to become a more significant player in the Indonesia banking sector.  While BBI is going through the transition from a privately owned company to a publicly listed company with a broader number of shareholders, IFC is in a position to facilitate such transition through strengthening corporate governance and transparency.  At the same time, IFC's investment would help BBI to become a model institution on the Jakarata Stock Exchange. 

Indirectly, IFC's investment would benefit the SME sector as BBI's focus is on the SME segment representing 40% of Indonesia's GDP and 50% of total employment.

Fit With World Bank Group Strategy and IFC Role
The World Bank Group's current strategy in Indonesia, as outlined in the FY01-03 Country Assistance Strategy, focuses on three broad areas closely related to the Government's priorities in its economic recovery program and its medium-term development plan: sustaining economic recovery and promoting broad-based growth, building national institutions for accountable government, and delivering better public services for the poor.

After placing its program (in March 2001) of new investments in Indonesia under review until the legal and law enforcement climate in the country improved, IFC cautiously restarted its program in February 2002. In terms of development priorities, IFC's strategy for Indonesia focuses on: 
assisting the recovery of the financial and corporate sectors - through provision of liquidity facilities, support of financial intermediaries, and assistance for corporate restructuring;
overcoming structural weaknesses in the economy  through  help in building up the institutional and regulatory framework, and 
promoting long-term sustainable development - by supporting environmentally sound practices in natural resource use, and the integration of the economy into a globalized marketplace. 
The proposed project is consistent with this strategy.

The company has created a global infrastructure that includes on-line retail, wholesale and catalog distribution channels, served by a network of sourcing hubs in seven developing countries.  The companys goal from its inception was to create a destination on the Internet for sales of locally produced arts and handicrafts.  This has been accomplished by providing professional and strategic resources to its artists, all of whom are located in the emerging markets, as well as by providing a scaleable technology platform that enables online sales to customers in the developed world.  The company is allowing artists to increase their standard of living and hire additional workers and is also helping to spread the use of technology among a group of people that were not previously part of the global marketplace.  Novica has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on the earning potential of numerous low-income artisans, due to higher volume sales and better prices for their goods.  As part of its stated Novica Law of Pricing, the company pays the artisans more for their product than alternative purchasers, yet keeps end prices relatively low, contributing to higher volumes.  Novica''s focus on quality and authenticity also enables the artisans to preserve their cultural heritage and prevents the loss of high quality skills that occurs when artisans are forced to focus on low cost buyers.  For smaller artisans, the rolling purchases facilitated by Internet sales help them avoid ""boom and bust"" cycles that characterize contracts with traditional exporters, allowing them to build up working and human capital in a sustainable manner.  A strengthened relationship with IFC would benefit Novica in many ways.  The company is already working with artisan groups and with IFCs Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) department to build supplier capacity, which allows the groups to access more profitable markets and hire additional employees.  There is also potential for IFCs Microfinance and Small Business Group (part of Global Financial Markets) to facilitate discussions between Novicas artists and IFCs micro finance portfolio companies.  This could enable Novicas artisans to secure small loans from these credit providers.  Novica believes these loans could enable its artisans to take increased inventory risk, and allow smaller artisans to increase their scale.  It is expected that many Novica artisans who currently have little or no access to formal credit institutions in their own countries will benefit from introduction and access to financial services from IFCs portfolio of dedicated micro finance institutions, enhanced access to working capital and other services that micro finance banks typically provide to self-employed artisans and other micro entrepreneurs.  IFCs experience has shown that this can have a major positive impact in reducing poverty and unemployment in emerging markets worldwide.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a category C project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.

The project concept is to develop a self-sustaining , commercially viable micro credit enhancement facility to support MFIs throughout the world.  The facility will provide credit enhancement products at commercial terms to MFIs working through local commercial banks.  These enhancements will enable and encourage the local banks to provide loans or to substantially increase the modest support that may be provided to MFIs, where such banks would otherwise not be prepared to make such loans and would do so with primarily local currency.  Credit enhancement products will include standby facilities, such as letters of credit, letters of guarantee and direct funded loans or deposits products with local commercial banks.  The facility will also provide credits directly or through local commercial banks.  Presently many MFIs fund growth of their local currency loan portfolios through hard currency loans.  This subjects them to foreign currency risk, which is the greatest risk affecting the microfinance industry globally.  The facility directly addresses this issue by filling the local commercial funding gap which strongly limits the growth of MFIs and should result in a stronger and more effective commercial microfinance industry, leading to economic development and increased opportunities for the MFIs and their borrowers.

The greenfield project represents the full 5 year investment program (2001-2005) for the establishment and operation of the second nationwide mobile telephone network offering various services, including but not limited to GSM cellular services and leased fixed lines to enterprises.

IFC's role in the project includes:
supporting the liberalization and private sector development of the telecom sector.
encouraging healthy competition in the cellular market in Albania.  This will result in:  lower tariffs; improved quality of service and customer responsiveness; expanded access to telecommunication services, and introduction of new services. 

Development Impact:
Given Albania's low telecom penetration rates (6.8% for fixed line), the venture would fulfill substantial unmet demand for reliable telecommunications services and thereby support economic growth.  It would also support competition in a previously monopolized mobile market which would result in lower tariffs and the introduction of new value added services for consumers.

First Lease,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,Ukraine,ALD AUTOMOTIVE UKRAINE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY,"Global Industry, Financial Markets",2003-02-21T05:00:00Z,2003-04-28T04:00:00Z,FI-1,Loan,"Established in late 1999, FL is one of the earliest entrants into the Ukrainian leasing sector.  FL's primary product is vehicle leasing/financing for enterprises operating in Ukraine.  The company primarily leases cars, light vans, and trucks which are used for monitoring and managing inventory; deliveries; and promotion.  The IFC credit line will be used to finance FL's operating lease activities which provide vehicle leasing to commercial enterprises in Ukraine.  

FL has also received the approval of a comprehensive technical assistance program (TA) with funding of $130,000 from the government of Holland.  As FL is still a young enterprise, the technical assistance project will focus on improving/developing several operational areas to help the company sustain its growth.  The TA project will involve the following, among other, components: 
integration of FL's back office and IT systems; 
assistance in new product development; and
implementation of a leasing oriented IAS accounting system.    

The benefits of leasing to private enterprises, particularly small and medium enterprises (SMEs), are well documented.  In Ukraine's credit-constrained environment, leasing will provide one of the few viable means of financing investments in assets.  This is particularly important in the SME sector where the lack effective financial intermediation is acute.  Ultimately, a well-functioning leasing sector would play an important role in supporting the capital investment needs of local enterprises.  

IFC's support of FL will help the company expand its leasing activities as well as develop further its internal management and technical systems.  IFC's credit line will provide needed financing to FL in an environment where access to term financing is extremely limited.  At the same time, the demand for leasing far outweighs the supply provided by existing leasing companies.  In addition, the technical assistance activities associated with the loan will help strengthen various business/operating aspects of the company as noted above.","","","","","","","","","","",This is an FI Type 1 project.

SAHL - Peregrine,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Africa,South Africa,SAHL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS (PTY) LTD,"Global Industry, Financial Markets",2003-02-26T05:00:00Z,2003-03-28T05:00:00Z,C,Equity,"SAHL is an existing company with both retail and wholesale mortgage banking lines of business.  It operates on the retail level by originating mortgages through a new and non-bank distribution channel.  SAHL offers existing mortgage holders the option to lower their mortgage rates, because the company has lower operating expenses than traditional banking firms.  This is called the 'switching business'.  SAHL has made significant inroads in this market.  In addition, the company operates in the wholesale market by securitizing it mortgage portfolio.  In this sense it provides a bridge between the primary mortgage market and the capital markets of South Africa.

This particular investment involves a buyout of Peregrine, one of the original investors in SAHL.  Peregrine today has about a 10 percent shareholding, but doesn't desire a longer term outlook in their investment.  IFC's buyout of this shareholder would restructure and rationalize the company's shareholding as it enters a new phase of corporate development

","","","","","","","","","There is a significant role for IFC to play going forward based on the following considerations:  
Demonstration effect on other countries of the region, particularly those with a high likelihood of developing housing finance systems in the near future.  IFC's continuing support for the best example of housing finance development in the region's most closely watched financial market will set a standard and send a signal for up to seven other countries in the Sub-Saharan Region.  The signal will be that IFC has the expertise, institutional binding power and vision to lead markets in terms of housing finance development.  The standard and the signal will make it easier for IFC to make progress in our high priority countries.  If we fail to take this opportunity, a contrary signal will be sent, with deleterious effects in other high priority countries.
Making housing finance more affordable:  The impact has been partially realized by opening a new distribution channel outside the dominant banking firms.  In addition, SAHL has succeeded in raising awareness of the significant over-pricing by the banks.  But the job is only partially complete.  Market share of originations is only about three percent.  On a book basis, market share is only slightly over one percent.  There is building political pressure on the big banks to serve their communities by offering mortgage loans to qualifying lower income households.  So, in addition to the upside in making further inroads in market share, SAHL is the  viable and proven conduit to handle lower income mortgage loans and increase funding to this segment.  IFC's increased investment in SAHL will bolster this line of business.
Developing a new asset class of MBS:  This has only partially been accomplished.  Two completed deals, although quite successful, are nonetheless limited, unless mortgage product can be sourced from other originators.  IFC's unique honest broker reputation gives us the best opportunity to achieve this.  Having a larger shareholding adds to our credibility in this endeavor.  It has become increasingly obvious that demand for MBS is growing, even beyond the normal long-term institutional investor base, as two banks have recently established commercial paper conduits that will invest in SAHL MBS.
Future market development: Ability to use SAHL as a possible vehicle for the development of a secondary mortgage market for residential loans.

As a result, IFC can leverage its investment in SAHL to have a greater impact in the development of the South African financial market.  This places an additional dimension to the value of SAHL from IFC's perspective.

Peregrine is one of the founding shareholders of SAHL.  Peregrine is an investment company.  Its principals have no expertise or special interest in the mortgage business.  Their initial shareholding could be construed as a pure venture capital investment.  They have not participated in rights issues, and are now interested in selling.  Of the major shareholders, IFC, by virtue of its relatively small shareholding, honest broker reputation and recognized expertise in housing finance, is uniquely positioned to buy the shares and instill a clearer sense of mission to the Company.  The two largest shareholders, Standard Bank and JP Morgan have very good working relationships with IFC.  Together, we would form a cohesive and effective management team.  This mission is every bit as important as infusing new capital.

The AnJia Group (AnJia or the group) was established in January, 2000 and currently comprises of three operating entities namely, AnGage Real Estate Service Company, which is engaged in residential mortgage origination and servicing, AnJia Info Tech Limited which produces real estate related software and AnLian Info which is a portal and internet services company.  AnGage has become the core operating entity within the AnJia Group. 

Purpose of Project:
With the recent privatization of the housing sector in Shanghai, the home resale market has grown rapidly. Banks engaged in housing finance do not have the retail network capability to process the large volumes of mortgages in demand. In addition, the lengthy administrative procedures involved in deed transfer and collateral registration delay the release of funding and stifle the market growth.  AnJia's participation in the market as an independent and neutral brokerage intermediary would allow the banks to focus on what they do best - make credit decisions - and outsource the laborious administrative aspects of origination, underwriting and servicing to a focused, specialized, and therefore more efficient brokerage entity - AnJia - thus enabling continued rapid growth in the industry.  However, for AnJia to succeed and thrive in its role, it needs to expand its operations and develop its staff and systems. Therefore the group has approached IFC for an equity investment to achieve this aim.

More specifically, the AnJia Group would use the funds from the proposed IFC investment to: 
strengthen its mortgage origination and servicing capability by acquisition and by expanding its physical retail outlets network; 
attract the qualified high calibre staff needed to support the rapid growth of the business, specifically to train and develop individual qualified mortgage brokers who will form the backbone of its retail mortgage servicing network;
overhaul its processing systems to increase capacity and improve information access and reliability; and
develop the AnJia brand and position the company as the leading mortgage originator and servicer in Shanghai.
","","","","","","","","","Development Impact
The proposed project will promote efficiency in the housing finance market by backing the development of an intermediary specializing in mortgage origination and servicing.  Focus and specialization on origination and servicing will shorten mortgage processing times, reduce costs, and hence improve efficiency. The venture will also facilitate faster growth in the home resale market and help promote private home ownership, thereby encouraging transfer of housing assets to the private sector.  These assets can be used as collateral in the future, therefore the project will help in broadening access to private sector led financial services.   The investment is also expected to have a demonstration effect on other similar players improving mortgage asset quality and introducing discipline in the housing finance market as a whole.  Also, by standardizing the origination and mortgage servicing processes, the project will facilitate new entry by banks to the housing finance market, enable existing banks to expand mortgage lending, and also set the stage for secondary mortgage market development.  Finally, the creation of an efficient large scale mortgage origination and servicing industry will facilitate the eventual entry of non-banking financial institutions in the housing market.

IFC Role
IFC backing will substantially enhance AnJia's financial standing,  its credibility in the financial sector and among customers and regulators.  IFC backing will also assist the company in attracting the high calibre professionals it needs to drive its expected rapid growth and development.  IFC's support is especially important during the company's early stages of development, where it will need assistance in building the necessary institutional and corporate governance structures to establish a solid foundation for future growth and business sustainability.  Over the longer term, IFC's participation in AnJia's growth and development positions IFC to assist, by way of technical assistance, in the development of uniform standards in mortgage origination and servicing, setting the stage for secondary market development.

(Copamex, or the company) is a leading Mexican producer of paper products for the consumer goods, industrial packaging and printing, and writing (P&W) markets.  Located in Monterrey, Copamex is a holding company with 39 subsidiaries (35 in Mexico, 2 in the United States, 1 in Costa Rica and 1 in Nicaragua) of which 36 are wholly-owned and 3 are majority-owned joint ventures. 

The company is embarking on a debt reduction and refinancing strategy which will enhance its financial flexibility and its ability to compete effectively.  As part of this strategy, Copamex has requested IFC's assistance to refinance part of its long term debt and to fund capital expenditure aimed at rationalizing existing facilities.  IFC will help Copamex improve its financial profile in order for the company to become a stronger regional player, better able to compete with multi-nationals.  The principal components of the project are as follows: 
financial restructuring and other measures designed to improve the ability of the company to access national and international sources of finance on competitive terms;
rationalization of existing facilities; and 
measures to improve corporate governance and environmental management and enhance the social impact of the company.","","","","","","","","","As the company shifts its production focus toward areas in which it has stronger competitive advantages, Copamex's profitability will increase. Specifically, consumer and packaging products will be emphasized taking full advantage of the Company's proximity to the market and its brands.  By refinancing US dollar debt with new peso financing with longer maturity, the company's foreign exchange risks will be reduced and longer maturities will free up resources.  Consequently, the enhancement of  Copamex's liquidity will allow its management to better focus on production and market issues and have the resources to invest in improvements.  The Project is also expected to support the viability of an important source of employment for 6,878 people in the company.  

Copamex contributes to the hygienic living standards of the people in the country through the production and distribution of affordable consumer products to all segments of the society.  The company significantly contributes to recycling wastepaper and cardboard generated in Mexico and abroad, since around two thirds of its raw material fiber is recycled.  By adopting IFC's environmental, health and safety policies and guidelines, the company will improve to stricter international practices and reduce risk to the public, while renewed emphasis on safety will provide its employees with safer working conditions.

IFC Role:
Provide long-term financing better suited to the Copamex's business dynamics.  While Mexico has enjoyed better access to capital following its investment grade rating, the current market volatility and the recessive environment will make it difficult for the company to raise long-term refinancing without IFC's involvement;
IFC expects also to provide some advisory services to improve corporate governance, environmental and social matters.","","This is an environmental review category B project.

The Maldonado family has two branches, namely the well known and reputable Maldonado Elizondo and Maldonado Gonzalez families.  The members of the Maldonado Elizondo family own in aggregate 92% of the company and play a bigger role in the management of the Copamex than the Maldonado Gonzalez family with 8%.

The Maldonado family is active in philanthropic and charitable causes through the Fundación de Beneficiencia Maldonado Quiroga, a 14-year old not-for-profit entity that gives donations to low-income groups in Monterrey.","The estimated Project Cost of $262 million is to refinance part of the company's debt and to fund capital expenditure for modernizing and rationalizing some of the Copamex's existing facilities.  The capital expenditure component of the project is not part of an expansion program, it consists instead of various investments necessary to keep the facilities competitive.

IFC will consider a long-term loan of up to $8.5 million to TMPL and further assist through a B-Loan syndication of an additional $8.5 million.

Due to limited appetite of banks for long-term financing in Maldives, companies operating in the Maldives have found it difficult to raise long-term debt on a limited-recourse basis. In the past, TMPL financed capital expenditure in its two properties with a combination of short term debt, cash generation, inter-company loans and small equity investments. TMPL would now like to refinance these loans totaling $17 million with longer-term loans, on a limited or non-recourse basis.","","","","","","","","","Tourism is one of two mainstays of the Maldives economy (the other is fishing) but it relies on expensive and scarce stopgap financing that threatens the long term financial health of firms in the sector.  Until now, TMPL has relied on parent support to find reasonably priced mid-term finance.  The proposed refinancing will put the company on a sustainable financial structure and the involvement of other financiers will introduce the company to international markets on a stand-alone basis.  In addition, linkages with the rest of the economy will also be created in fishing, and food and beverage supplies.  Taj Group brings extensive training and international best practices in operating resorts which will increase the skill levels of local employees.  

IFC has a strong role in supporting the project as it provides:

- Access to long-term capital. IFC would provide limited-recourse, long-term debt (ten or nine years) to TMPL, as financing on these terms is generally not available in the Maldives. Such support for TMPL will be a signal to the international commercial finance community of the improved investment climate in the country, as well as of the commercial viability of investment in the key tourism sector.  IFC may also help mobilize additional long term financing by way of B-Loan syndication. IFC involvement will help implement an appropriate financial structure in the company.
- Attract international financial institutions to participate in investments in Maldives.  IFC may also help the company mobilize additional long term financing by way of B-Loan syndication.
- Technical assistance in environmental and social best practices.  While TMPL has been environmentally responsible in most aspects of operations, IFC has leveraged its ability to mobilize scarce long-term financing by convincing the company to implement a fire, life safety and water treatment improvements.  In addition, TMPL will participant in a coral reef restoration program initiated by the IFC.
- Encouragement of 'south to south' Foreign Direct Investment.  Taj Group is a leading Indian company with investments in Sri Lanka, Maldives, Nepal, Goa, and Zambia.

These frogs, which are spectacularly colored and display an interesting behavior, fetch a high price in the international pet trade. The U.S.A, Europe and Japan have steadily growing PDF markets.The production method only functions in standing forests. It was invented after meticulous study of the frogs breeding cycle.  The female glues her eggs onto a leaf, above the ground in a tree. When the tadpoles hatch, the male puts them on his back and carries them to water, typically in the crook of a leaf.  The female then raises her young by feeding them unfertilized eggs.Research has shown that the limiting factor of the population is the number of suitable breeding sites. The production method consists of placing artificial breeding sites in the frogs natural habitat. These greatly enhance breeding success, thereby allowing the ""surplus"" of PDFs to be harvested from the bottles, put in grow-out cages on the forest floor, and then exported as juvenile frogs.Although the economics of the business appear to be strong, its novel and unprecedented nature makes it difficult to obtain standard commercial finance.  Although this proposal recently won the World Bank''s Innovation in the Marketplace competition, additional funding is needed to fully capitalize the business and carry out essential preparatory activities (e.g., training of customs officials).  Therefore, IFC has submitted a proposal to the GEF it order to help catalyze this exciting new venture.  In doing so, IFC will make an important contribution to global efforts to find viable ways to monetize the economic value inherent in biodiversity in a manner that encourages conservation of biodiversity resources.  The frog export business  with expected annual revenues of about $300,000 in Year 3  will provide supplemental livelihoods to more than 250 campesinos and give them an incentive to preserve over 15,000 hectares of tropical forest.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project, according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.  The review of this project consisted of appraising and reviewing environmental and social information submitted by the project sponsor.  The following potential environmental, health, safety and social impacts of the project were analyzed:-  Possible Induced Migration:To prevent induced migration, the project will make it widely known that it can only employ people who lived in or near the project sites when the project started (which will be established through baseline social surveys). Interested and trained campesinos or natives will organize themselves into frog producer groups, which will operate under a special license, management plans, and operational plans in accordance with INRENA guidelines.  To participate in the project, the frog producer groups will formally agree to protect their forests and prevent new immigration of external campesinos to the management areas (i.e., community based forest protection).-  Impacts on Illegal PDF trade:The project will be able to pay rural inhabitants enough to diminish (or eliminate) their incentives to sell PDFs into the illegal pet trade.  As a further disincentive, individuals who sell to illegal traders will no longer be able to sell to the project.  Thus, it does not appear that the project will exacerbate the illegal trade in PDFs; in fact, the project is likely to reduce the illegal trade. The market study shows that consumers of the frogs prefer legally produced and exported frogs instead of smuggled ones, if the quality and price is acceptable. -  Deforestation:The project provides rural inhabitants with an incentive for preserving directly over 15,000 hectares of tropical forest. In doing so, it will aim to create a network of conserved original habitats for at least 60 currently known Peruvian poison dart frog species and distinct variants. The project will establish agreements with communities in which they agree to not cut down the forest in exchange for participation in the frog production activities. In fact, the members of the producer units will also protect their backland forests to prevent new immigration and lumbering.  Beyond that, the frog project will seek to sustainable produce and commercialize other NFTP products as well in order to improve overall value produced in standing rainforest. Finally, there will be close monitoring throughout project implementation to verify compliance.  Anyone who violates the agreements will no longer be able to participate in the project.   -  Safety of Frog Ranching Activities:Peruvian poison dart frog species are not very toxic in the wild.  It is not dangerous to touch the Peruvian PDFs and severe allergic reactions unheard of.  In fact, PDFs produced via the ZIRA method can be completely nontoxic because they are not fed insects containing toxins. Thus, the project participants and the future clients should not be in any particular danger.  -  Potential Creation of Inequity within Communities:The project has developed a promising approach to distribute the benefits from frog sales within each participating community.  In designing the income distribution plan, the sponsors have tried to avoid having a few inhabitants of a given community have a high income from frog sales  while many other community members go without any income from the project.  Although such an approach would have been easier from a technical and economic point of view (because it would allow the project to work with a smaller number of people), it would offer fewer social and ecological benefits.  Instead, based on the total estimated income that could be generated from frog sales in each community, the sponsor will try to involve as many inhabitants as possible, such that each campesino obtains at least a basic salary.  -  Impact on Indigenous People:The project implementers have been advised of IFCs policy with regard to indigenous communities.   Some indigenous communities have already expressed interest in participating in the project.  If it is feasible for the project implementers to sustainably produce PDFs in these areas, then they will seek to maximize benefits for the indigenous communities in a culturally sensitive way.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityThe Environmental Review Summary (ERS) is available locally via Asociacion Curmi (see below).","The overall project will be implemented by Asociación Curmi, a Peruvian NGO with a track record as a successful incubator of local green businesses.  In the areas where the frog project will take place, Curmi has promoted agricultural projects to substitute slash-and-burn agriculture with permanent crops such as cocoa and hearts of palm.  Asociación Curmi will receive scientific and technical support from the Institute for Research into the Biology of the Eastern Andes (INIBICO).  INIBICO is an NGO devoted to the study and preservation of the flora and fauna in northern Perus high rainforest.","The total project cost is $1,845,922.

ANSM has water rights for 124 different sources totaling 4,584 liters/second.  The majority of these sources (91%) are groundwater, with the remainder being surface water rights.  These water rights, which are the equivalent of 144 million m3 of water per year, cover the regions consumption requirements as of today about four times over.  ANSM has six primary water treatment plants and eight primary wastewater treatment plants with several more under construction.  Water is distributed by a pipeline network of approximately 1,679 km, complemented by a wastewater collection network of 1,373 km and 17 wastewater pumping stations.  At the end of the year 2001, ANSMs water supply coverage was 99.6%, wastewater collection was 93.6%, and wastewater treatment was 5.7%.  Almost 100% of ANSMs customers have installed and functioning water meters.  The company has a total capital investment plan amounting to $95.6 million in the years between 2002-2007, of which the large majority will be dedicated to the construction of new wastewater treatment plants.  One of the first plants to be completed was for the town of Curico in December 2001, with an additional 11 smaller plants to be commissioned by the year 2004, which will result in total wastewater treatment rate in the concession area of about 87%.  The company expects to achieve full wastewater treatment coverage in its concession area by the year 2006.  The capital investments to be undertaken by ANSM over the 2002-2007 period will provide important environmental and health benefits and improvements in the living standards of the inhabitants in the concession area, of which a significant proportion is poor.

Norvial S.A.,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Peru,NORVIAL SA,Regional Industry - INF LAC,2003-04-15T04:00:00Z,2003-05-22T04:00:00Z,A,Loan,"In April 2001, the Government of Peru (GoP) opened an international bidding for the Ancon - Huacho - Pativilca section of the Panamericana highway.  Five consortia were prequalified, three presented a technical proposal, and two presented an economic proposal.  The consortium led by Graña y Montero S.A.A. [G&M] (which included JJC Contratistas Generales S.A. [JJC]) offered the highest canon and won the bid.  Norvial S.A. was established in October 2002 and signed a Concession Agreement with the GoP in January 2003.   

The project is to expand, improve, operate and maintain the Ancon  Huacho  Pativilca section of the Panamericana highway (the 'toll road') over a 25-year period.  The toll road is used to travel to and from cities and towns along the Pacific coast north of Lima, including Huaral, Huacho, Supe, Barranca and Pativilca.  It provides important activities - such as industrial manufacturing, agriculture, mining and fisheries  access to Peru's main port (Callao) and to Lima.  In the first 2½ years of the concession, main investments include: 
- construction of two bypasses (1+1 lane) with a total length of 34 km, 
      -  construction of two bridges with a total length of 587 m, 
-  construction of two interchanges, and 
-  rehabilitation in different sections of the highway.
","","","","","","","","","Project Development Impact

Improved maintenance and better traffic flow on the main northern approach to the capital will provide cost savings to cars, buses and trucks using the road. Internal cargo consists mainly of mining and agricultural commodities for export and for consumption in the metropolitan area and industrial and consumer goods moving inland.  

Cost savings are expected to directly help activities (such as mining, fishing and agribusiness) along the road, and indirectly throughout the country, through improved access to the main domestic market as well as the airport and port facilities in Lima.  Agricultural and other producers within the poorer rural hinterlands of the concession roads will also have better access to larger markets in the urban areas.  Also, routine road maintenance services require local labor; increased maintenance activities will benefit local communities providing such labor. The planned project investments are expected to reduce vehicle operating costs by avoiding congestions that could otherwise create bottlenecks. Other services that users of the concession benefit from, include roadside mechanic assistance, ambulance services and emergency telephones.  

An important feature of the concession is the expected improved safety of urban areas that will no longer suffer from long distance (heavy) traffic.  Therefore, this investment is expected to reduce the accident and fatality rate.  It is also expected to improve quality of life of urban dwellers along the road, as noise and pollutants would diminish.  The project would also free up scarce public resources through both the concessionaire assuming the operation and maintenance of the roads as well as payment of income taxes, newly established VAT, and the road fund fee.  In addition, Norvial will pay a fee to OSITRAN, thus contributing to the strengthening of regulatory institutions for the benefit of the general public.

IFC Role

IFC would play a key role by creating an appropriate financial structure and would provide long-term funding which is currently unavailable for this kind of project in Peru.  IFC's presence is essential to provide funding on commercially reasonable terms. 

This is the first toll road concession to be awarded under the GoP's Highway Development Plan of 1996 (through the concession of 11 networks across the country under a BOT framework) and is expected to be used as a model for future toll road concessions.  Given the recent economic slowdown in Latin America that is affecting private sector interest in infrastructure investments in Peru, IFC's participation in the structuring and financing of this concession would provide a strong demonstration effect that could help attract further private sector investments in the upcoming highway concessions planned by the GoP (Highway Network 6, south of Lima, has already prequalified bidders).  The Sponsors also asked IFC's participation to benefit from IFC's expertise in structuring successful toll projects in the region and worldwide.
","","This is an environmental and social review category A project.  The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the project identifies several positive impacts and the following key issues: -  resettlement associated to land acquisition; -  management of cultural property affected by the project; and -  management of environmental impacts occurring during the construction and operation of the project.-  Positive ImpactsThe EIA predicts that the project will promote the socio-economic growth of the northern zone of the Lima state, especially in the provinces of Huaura and Barranca, by facilitating transportation of agricultural and industrial products to commercial centers in and around Lima and to Peru''s main port (Callao).  The EIA also anticipates that the improvements to the Ancon-Huacho-Pativilca toll road will benefit other population centers through increased tourism to the various natural and historical sites in the area (including Lomas de Lachay National Reserve, Medio Mundo Lagoons, Caral Ruins and Castle of Chancay).  These tourism resources can be more fully exploited with increased socio-economic integration of the zone.  The planned bypasses and interchanges will keep trucks away from the cities of Huacho and Barranca and other populated areas and, therefore, will reduce noise and accident risk.-  ResettlementThe main negative impact of the project will be the physical and economic displacement caused by the acquisition of the right of way. Of the 541 parcels to be affected, 509 will be acquired in whole and 32 in part. Nearly 84% of the affected parcels are in rural areas. Approximately 75 families who live in dwellings that occupy the right of way will have to relocate.A Compensation and Relocation Action Plan (CAP) has been developed to mitigate the impact of land acquisition.  The compensation program will be implemented on the basis of Law No. 27628, enacted in January 2002.  This law creates a procedure called trato directo (direct negotiation), which makes it possible to purchase land for public projects without having to resort to expropriation proceedings.  The properties that cannot be acquired through trato directo are subject to expropriation under the rules of Law No. 27117 (General Expropriations Law).    The CAP includes a program to regularize land tenure in parcels affected by the right of way, which will permit the compensation of persons who have possession rights, but lack legal title to their land. In addition, the CAP includes various relocation and rehabilitation programs that are consistent with the requirements of the World Banks Operational Directive 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement.  -  Impacts on Cultural PropertyThe project will affect five archeological sites: Cerro Colorado, Vispan, Sendero Vispan y Paicuan and El Molino.  Archeological evaluation and rescue projects will be implemented in each of the five sites, following the guidelines of the Technical Commission on Archeology of the National Institute of Culture (NIC).  Prior to the beginning of construction the concessionaire must develop an Archeological Evaluation and Rescue Project according to the requirements of the Regulations for Archeological Research of the NIC.  During construction the concessionaire must implement a monitoring program under the responsibility of a professional archeologist.  All materials found must be analyzed and the results of such analysis must be published.  -  Environmental ManagementAn Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was developed as part of the EIA for the construction and operation phases of the project, and provides for monitoring and mitigating environmental and health & safety impacts.  The plan includes measures to prevent and/or mitigate environmental impacts during construction, such as measures to manage construction of access roads and provisional facilities, waste dumps, water sources, machinery and equipment, transportation of materials, quarries, asphalt plants, crusher plants and concrete plants.  The EMP also contains measures to protect the environment during the operation phase of the project, such as measures to protect air quality, reduce noise and prevent erosion and flooding.  The EMP also includes a monitoring program and an emergency response program. One of the construction companies, G&M, has developed an Environmental Management System (EMS) based on the standard ISO 14001, as well as a Risk Prevention Plan and a Manual to Prevent Accidents in Construction Works.  The procedures described in these documents are consistent with EIA requirements.The contract between Norvial and the toll road operator, Concar S.A., obliges the latter to implement the measures specified in the EMP.  The contract between Norvial and the construction consortium will also require the implementation of procedures called for in the EMP.Location of environmental documents in locally affected communityThe EIA has been locally disclosed at Norvial's administrative offices, located in Paseo de la Republica 4667, Lima 34, Peru.","Norvial is owned 34% by G&M, 33% by JJC and 33% by Besco, a fully owned subsidiary of Besalco (Chile).

This credit line helps enable private companies and individuals fill the gap left by the state.

In December 2000, IFC approved and signed a guarantee to help finance the construction of the wheat mill in Machava-Maputo (Project Number: 10185). The project is successful and achieved 100% of its production capacity two years ahead of appraisal projections.

Merec II is a project for the expansion of Merec Industries Lda's wheat mill processing activities in Mozambique. Merec intends to build a new wheat mill including grain storage silos in Beira, the capital of Sofala Province and the second largest city in Mozambique.  A new 140tonne/24h Buhler mill and silos with storage capacity of 12,500 tonnes will be installed in new buildings, with production scheduled to begin in 2005. 

Following Merec's success with the first project in Maputo, the company management decided to test the market for Merec's products in the Beira region to the north of Maputo using a portion of its output from the Maputo wheat mill plant.  The good quality of the product and the reliable distribution of Africom (a distribution company owned the sponsors of Merec Industries Lda) have contributed towards the success of this experiment in Beira.  Merec is now selling 12,000 tonnes of flour per year in this area but is experiencing demand for this in the South so that once the Beira project is complete there will be no problem switching back.  The opportunity in Central Mozambique will be fully exploited through this expansion project.
","","","","","","","","","The project development impact can be summarized in the following categories:

-  Enterprise Development: Merec is interested in participating in supply chain and distributor chain linkages, which with the assistance of IFC can help the growth of small and micro enterprises (MSME's).  This will involve the provision of technical assistance for the local micro and small bakeries, which will use their products. . Merec's new project will create opportunities for many small businesses to supply goods and services to the plant.  A growth in the supply chain will also come about as Merec will be distributing its increased volume through a network of small scale distributors and in some cases directly to new small bakeries.  Merec has also requested the support of IFC in the development of the company's HIV/Aids awareness and treatment programs. 

-  Economic Growth: The World Bank Group's objectives in Mozambique include supporting the Government's program for poverty reduction by investing in sustainable industrial projects.  The Merec expansion project will add economic value and create 48 new, direct jobs.  Merec will provide the necessary on-the-job training for supervision and technical staff in order to improve skills and strengthen the industrial base.  Merec will source its packaging locally and will also promote local transport companies which will be subcontracted to carry grain and finished product.

-  Provision of Finance: IFC is providing financial backing through the guarantee facility thereby enhancing the ability of a local bank in Mozambique to make a long-term loan available to the project.  There is a shortage of long term project finance available in Mozambique because of the need for bank liquidity and perceptions of risk.","","This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental review procedure.

The proposed fund is a closed-end special purpose vehicle, structured as a Collateralized Bond Obligation (CBO), which will invest in emerging market debt issues. The fund is structured to offer investment opportunities both to existing emerging markets investors and to credit-quality sensitive institutional investors who can only invest in investment-grade instruments. The fund is expected to be at least 70% invested in 30 countries at closing in June 2003, in a globally diversified portfolio of US dollar denominated debt issues from emerging markets. Against the assets of the fund, three classes of obligations:
-  Senior Notes, 
-  Second Priority Notes, and 
-  Preference Shares - are expected to be issued in an amount of $400 million. 
The Senior and Second Priority Notes will be over-collateralized and credit-enhanced by the Preference Shares and are targeted to receive a higher investment grade rating of Aa2 and Baa2 from Moody's, and AA and BBB- from S&P, respectively. The Senior Notes will be wrapped by a monoline insurer guarantee to achieve a rating of Aaa/AAA. 
The fund will invest in emerging market corporate, quasi-sovereign, and sovereign debt securities and is a vehicle designed to support the World Bank Group strategy of promoting the development of corporate debt markets in the member developing countries.","","","","","","","","","The fund is to play an important role in enhancing the status of emerging markets corporate debt as a distinct asset class for international institutional investors.  Consequent to the global economic downturn, retrenchment of banks and hedge funds from emerging market debt has seriously affected domestic companies' accessibility to foreign funding. New issuance of corporate paper has declined to $19 billion in 2002 from a high of $41 billion in 1997. Through investment in this fund, IFC will encourage dedicated fixed income fund managers in this asset class to successfully create new products in the form of structured debt funds that are designed to modify the return/risk profile of emerging market assets to tap those investors who are limited to investment grade securities and increase the overall demand for emerging market corporate debt, thereby facilitating emerging markets companies to access the international capital markets either to lower their funding costs or extend their debt maturities or both. 

Traditionally, the emerging markets investment pool has largely been limited to investors in high-yield bonds, a relatively specialized investor group with limited resources for high-risk classes of assets. By structuring a specialized investment vehicle for large credit-rating-sensitive institutional investors to access emerging market debt securities, IFC would send a strong signal that IFC is committed to develop innovative financial instruments for these investors. 

According to the fund manager's initial market soundings, investors are hesitant about investing in emerging market debt issues.  In order to move the fund forward, TCW must structure the subordinate tranche of the CBO, which is always the most challenging component in such transactions. This problem has been further compounded as institutional investors are trying to reduce risk on their balance sheets and have limited appetite for emerging market exposure. Participation by a strong investor like IFC in the subordinate tranche at the early stage is likely to have a significant catalytic effect and be critical to the distribution and placement of the fund.","","This is an environmental review category FI-1 project. All potential corporates considered for inclusion in the underlying asset pool will require that the issuer''s business does not involve activities on IFC''s exclusion list. Corporates from companies with known poor environmental and/or social practices will also be excluded.

As of December 31, 2002, the bank's total assets stood at $349.8 million equivalent and the total capital equaled $54.8 million equivalent including the subordinated debt.

The project involves the provision of long-term funding of up to $20 million to the Bank to support the expansion of its mid-term lending operations. Through this loan IFC will enhance the supply of much-needed finance to the local private sector. With the increased economic activity in Kazakhstan over the last two years, due to favorable oil prices and a stable economy, there is undoubtedly a substantially increased demand from companies for longer term financing.  The proposed investment is therefore intended, although in a small way, to address this demand.  A secondary benefit is that it will increase competitiveness in the country's banking system","","","","","","","","","The project will have a major impact on two areas that are critical for development in Kazakhstan:  

-  Availability of term financing for long-term projects. The project's principal development impact is its direct contribution in addressing Kazakhstan's critical  constraint to future sustainable economic growth. Furthermore, the proceeds of the loan will be on-lent to private sector companies which will contribute to the potential job creation.

-  The development of competition in the banking sector. 

IFC's loan would help extend the maturity of CK's funding base, enabling the bank to provide longer-term and affordable funds for corporate borrowers.","","This is an environmental and social review category FI type 2 project.

HSBC Trust,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Argentina,Fideicomiso Financiero Exportadores II,Regional Industry - FIG LAC,2003-04-25T04:00:00Z,2003-05-25T04:00:00Z,C,Loan,"The project will be a two-stage effort to support expansion of an Export Securitization Program (the program) organized by a consortium of Argentine banks. The banks are led by HSBC Bank Argentina S.A. (HSBC), BBVA Banco Frances S.A. (BBVA) and Banco Rio de La Plata S.A. (BRLP and together they are called the Arrangers). The program provides pre-shipment export financing to Argentine corporates.The two stages of the program will be structured through Financial Trusts incorporated in Argentina under Law 24.441 (the Trust), to be created by HSBC, BBVA and BRLP as Arrangers and Trustors. The Trusts will acquire predetermined USD-denominated, pre-shipment export loans originated by the Arrangers, and will fund this origination activity by issuing USD-denominated short-term debt notes (the Notes or the Securities). The Notes will be issued under the Argentine public offering regime and will be registered with the Comision Nacional de Valores (CNV).  Preliminarily, domestic pension funds (AFJPs) will be targeted as investors for the Notes.  In the short-term, the project is expected to support further expansion of the program, in order to make it more widely available for Argentine exporters.  This may catalyze a significant mobilization of funding from pension funds, which are currently quite liquid, to the cash-strapped export sector. Given the current state of the Argentine banking sector  which has traditionally funded trade finance activity in the country  such a mobilization is essential in order to provide needed funding to Argentine exporters.  A medium-term objective of the project (and the program) is to attract international investors to an asset class with a relatively attractive commercial structure, but where perceived Argentine country risk is mitigated.The project will have two stages.  In a first stage, IFC would support the execution of an up to $40 million financing under the program (EXPO II), by providing a stand-by purchase commitment to the Arrangers for up to $10 million.  This purchase commitment can be accessed -- at the Arrangers'' sole discretion -- in order to cover an under-subscription or achieve an over-subscription of Notes to be issued.  IFCs participation in the first stage of the program would be instrumental to replicate the success of the initial EXPO transaction, given that:-  EXPO II is larger than EXPO I, -  domestic pension funds are still not well acquainted with the program, and -  EXPO II will securitize assets from a larger group of exporters.In a second stage, a larger transaction (EXPO III) including around 30 smaller exporters is planned. As a result of the more diverse credit profile of this second group of exporters and nature of assets underlying a proposed securitization undertaken on their behalf, it is expected that credit rating agencies will require a junior/subordinated tranche in Notes issued by the Trust for EXPO III, and that a two-tier funding structure is therefore necessary in order for the Notes to achieve a credit rating compatible with pension funds investment guidelines.  In this second stage of the project, IFCs investment participation in EXPO III would entail subscription of up to a $5 million portion of a junior Notes tranche to be issued by the Trust, as well as a stand-by purchase commitment to the transactions Trust for up to $5 million.","","","","","","","","","As a result of cutbacks in conventional trade finance from international and domestic banks due to Argentinas debt servicing difficulties, its bank crisis, as well as global risk aversion, Argentine exporters  even top-notch domestic names  face difficulties in obtaining pre- and post-shipment trade funding.The project is primarily meant to help address this situation by :-  Providing new sources of funding to exporters, thereby allowing them to capitalize on their improved underlying international competitiveness as a result of currency depreciation.  -  Promoting development of Argentinas capital markets by increasing the supply of a new asset class (i.e., securitized trade finance receivables) that may prove to be an attractive investment opportunity for domestic institutional investors (principally pension funds), who have ample and growing liquidity; and-  Encouraging further development of a relatively low credit risk asset class (i.e., trade finance receivables securitized via a well-designed transactional structure and incorporating offshore payment mechanisms), which may be attractive to international investors, thereby enticing them to gradually return to Argentina in the medium term.     IFCs role in this transaction is four-fold: -  Supporting an initiative to bring much needed new trade finance funding to Argentine exporters; -  Collaborating with a major domestic financial intermediary to mobilize funding from pension funds system for the countrys export sector;  -  Helping to expand use of a new financing structure to smaller and less sophisticated exporters; and -  Demonstrating that an innovative structure which mitigates cross-border risk is viable.","",This is a Category C project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.

The program will develop projects that can lead to the creation of replicable models with the establishment of strong partnerships between donors, the government, the local private sector, and other relevant actors, with IFC as the catalyst.The program will focus its efforts on implementation activties in the following core areas:-  Supporting the development of clusters in specific sectors	- in Bolivia - wood, tourism, llama, wool, quinoa, textiles	- in Peru - tourism, textiles, white maize	- in Honduras - wood, tourism, and ornamental plants	- in Nicaragua - tourism and wood-Improving the business enabling environment by supporting selected government red tape reduction initiatives (e.g. registration and licensing simplification);-  Improving the capacity of financial institutions to better serve the SME market;-  -  Linkage programs to be developed around IFC investments, where the SME Department''s linkages team would work to build the capacity of small and medium business to provide inputs and services to larges companies;-  Special Programs  - depending on donor support, a number of additional activities with innovative foundations, NGOs, universities etc. are envisaged.  This will include support to microfinance institutions for capacity building, training, roll-out of new technologies, i.e. mobile ATM machines with thumb print identification, and SME development programs to link micro rural producers into urban and export marketsThe program will be executed with the benefit of the best practices available from other project development facilities and the Private Enterprise Partnership (PEP) model that implements technical assistance to SMEs in the former Soviet Union countries.IFC''s Role:  IFC has taken the lead in designing and fund-raising for the program, and once established, the World Bank Group SME Department in close collaboration with the IFC LAC regional Department will manage the program on behalf of IFC and other donors.  IFC''s role will be to transfer best practice in the thematic areas envisaged for support and to use the experience accummulated in SME development through other PDFs and the PEP to support SMEs development in program countries.  IFC can also draw upon its strategic partnership with best practice partners ( for eg, FUNDES, ACCION, SEAF)  in areas ranging from business development services, SME finance to the enabling environment to develop cutting edge programs using these ""best practice partners"" experience worldwide.  Additionally, as part of the WBG, IFC is uniquely placed to create synergies between ongoing policy reform aimed at private sector development work supported by Bank PSD projects and  activities aimed at supporting SMEs. Development Impact:  The majority of the private sector firms in the region are SMEs and many operate in the informal sectors, largely due to the numerous constraints they face that are common across countries.  The program will help to address these constraints, promote robust SME sectors in these countries and foster much-needed job creation, which are essential requirements for poverty reduction in the region. Where applicable, prior to  each project''s commencement, IFC will take a baseline measure which will be used to assess the development impact throughout the life of the project as measured by its contribution to inter alia: market development, demand driven business development services, improvements in the business environment, increase in value added exports and local sales, and economic and social welfare (increased employment, poverty reduction). IFC currently operations eight PDFs worldwide, which have provided high impact, targeted assistance to thousands of SMEs in diverse regions.  The program will build upon the experience and knowledge-base that has been accummulated in these operations.  It will benefit from the facilities-wide strengthening program now underway, which places more focus on cost recovery, domestic capacity building, sustainability, a broader range of service offerings, partnership, donor exit arrangements and metrics.The program will also draw on the PEP model that IFC has established in former Soviet Union countries.  The Partnership has demonstrated that its technical assistance programs have shown positive results in creating job and in increasing local income, building financial market, improving corporate governance and environmental practices, and shaping legislation aimed at improving the investment climate.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category C project, according to IFC''s Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because it is likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts.Location of environmental documents In locally affected community","The project sponsors are IFC, bilateral donors and multilateral institutions.

Cartones America S.A.,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Colombia,CARTONES AMERICA S A,"Gbl Ind, Manufact, Agribus & Services",2003-05-01T04:00:00Z,2003-06-13T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"The Cartones América Group (CAME, the Group or the company) is a leading, privately-owned, Andean Region manufacturer of containerboard, corrugated boxes, clay-coated paperboard, spiral tube board and specialty board packaging products.. The Group traces its roots back to the 1950s in Cali, Colombia. In recent years the company has grown steadily, investing in operations in Venezuela (1993), Ecuador (1998), and Peru (2000).  CAME is in an important phase of its development and the project is aimed at helping CAME consolidate recent investments and realize the synergies to be achieved in its operations across the Andean Region..","","","","","","","","","IFC's support for CAME will support the Company's drive to become more efficient and competitive.  Impacts on economic development in Colombia are given below.

-  Strengthening a non-traditional industrial activity to enhance the country's economic diversification.     

-  Employment Impact-  CAME employs nearly 600 people directly.  Further, indirectly its operations support the activities of 40 recycled paper collection companies in the Andean Region which employ 800 people directly and an estimated 8,000 indirectly.  In Bogotá, CAME is participating in a program with the municipality to build recycled waste collection centers which are operated by street collectors.

-  Community Development:-  CAME actively supports its workers in home purchase.  More than 90% of its workers in Cali are homeowners, and it has been implementing the same program for employees at its companies in Ecuador and Peru.  CAME has also supported the formation of SMEs in service areas including transportation, maintenance and production of labor intensive items such as dividers.  Finally, CAME invests in training at all levels.  Its policy is to cover 50% of the cost of educational programs attended by its employees, and many of its employees have acquired technical, university and masters degrees. 

-  Environmentally Friendly.-  CAME's mills use recycled waste as it main raw material.  The Group has invested in technology to permit the utilization of lower grades of recycled fibers.  They have also made investments to substitute boiler fuel from diesel to natural gas and to increase water consumption efficiency.  

IFC's role in the project has the three aspects outlined below.

-  Access to Long-term Financing.-  Recession, liquidity constraints in the domestic banking sector, struggles with narco-terrorist activity, and Colombia's loss of its investment grade rating have severely constrained access to long-term credit, even for strong credits such as CAME.  Many foreign commercial banks have left the Colombian market or conduct short-term trade financing only and IFC remains one of few long-term sources of financing for independent companies.  

-  Catalytic Role.-  Given the situation described above, CAME's current lenders would not be able to extend the maturities of their current loan exposures in individually.  However, with IFC taking a lead by extending a loan of up to 9 years maturity, some of these banks have indicated that on the basis of an improved debt maturity profile, they will be able to increase the final maturity of some of their current loans to CAME from about 2-3 years to about 7 years.  

-  Value-Added for next Stage of Corporate Development.  Historically a family-owned company, CAME is rising through the ranks of middle market companies to become a more significant regional player.  Its next stage of development may include geographic diversification into Central America and the Caribbean and a potential linking with an industrial partner.  The company may be able to leverage IFC's ties in the industry and its experience in neighboring markets to support the pursuit of these objectives.

-  Support for Cross-Border Operation.  IFC's support for CAME is consistent with the objectives of the governments of the Andean Region to promote cross-border business and financial synergies.  In particular, IFC's engagement is important in backing the Group's operations in Venezuela, where CAME has extremely limited financing options due to the recent crises.","","This is a Category B project according to IFC''s Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects, because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Location of environmental documents in locally affected communityThe environmental documents and ERS will be made available in the following locations:

The Haiti Project is a phased development of a 500,000 m2 site on the border of Haiti and DR.  Phase 1 of the investment program will develop an area of 150,000 m2  for a total investment of $11 million. Upon completion, Phase 1 is expected to generate 1,500 direct jobs and up to 3,000 indirect jobs for Haitian workers in the adjacent area.  Subsequent development is expected to include outside customers producing apparel, footwear and other  products who would lease or purchase facilities built to order by the zone development company, which will be 100% owned by Grupo M. The total site area would allow up to 40 factory units providing as many as 20,000 direct jobs and 40,000 indirect jobs at full capacity. The project is to provide 
-  a corporate financing to Grupo M (the Group or the company), a vertically integrated apparel manufacturer in the Dominican Republic producing knits and woven products for the US market, to finance ongoing capital expenditures, long term working capital needs and to refinance existing obligations, and 
-  a loan to finance an export zone promoted by Grupo M focusing on garment production in the Republic of Haiti (the Haiti Project).","","","","","","","","","Grupo M is the largest private sector employer in the DR.  The company has been an innovator in adopting sustainable business practices since its founding.  The Group has ISO9002 certification and has won awards for labor practice and corporate citizenship.  Financing of Grupo M is an opportunity for IFC to secure the long term growth of the Group.

The Haiti Project will have a very significant development impact. This project is the key private sector development in the Republic of Haiti creating an opportunity to rejuvenate the garment sector in the country, which once employed more than 60,000 people but has reduced substantially in the past 10 years. If successful, the development of the zone and the direct investments by Grupo M can be expected to mobilize significant other private sector investments creating as many as 60,000 direct and indirect jobs and thus a dramatic impact to alleviate poverty. IFC is working closely with the Group on additional initiatives in support of sustainability and linkages to the wider community in Haiti.

IFC will play a key role in this investment, firstly through its support of a major private investor making a first investment in the Republic of Haiti. IFC's presence as a long term investor will significantly enhance the attractiveness of the Haiti Project for Grupo M and for other private sector investors who can be expected to follow their lead.  The proposed IFC corporate financing  of Grupo M will provide otherwise unavailable long term funding to significantly bolster the long term competitiveness and sustainability of Grupo M, the largest employer in the DR and the flagship of the Dominican garment sector.","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

The Government of Brazil (GOB) established the Programa Prioritário de Termeletricidade (PPT Program) in order to incentivize the development of licensed thermal power plants so as to more optimally balance the country's power generation capacity base.  The project is designed to complement the Northeast region's hydropower-based electricity production by providing natural gas-fired generation capacity.  The project is included in the PPT program.

The plant will sell its entire output, under a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), to Companhia Energética do Ceará (Colece), the sole electricity distribution company for the state of Ceará.  Cegás, the gas distribution company for the state of Ceará, and Petrobrás, the national oil and gas company, will supply natural gas to the project under 20-year Gas Supply Agreements (GSAs).  Mitsui is the selected EPC Contractor.  The total project cost is estimated at about $250 million.  The plant is currently under construction, and is expected to achieve commercial operation by December 2003.
","","","","","","","","","The project is expected to have significant developmental impacts in that it will help to address a key developmental and strategic priority of both the GOB and the World Bank.  The project will provide reliable and environmentally sound additional thermal power generation capacity to the poor northeast region of Brazil, the region that is heavily dependent on one river  São Francisco river  and was the worst affected by the 2001 energy crisis.  Thereby, it will provide important system complementarities to the hydro-based system of the Northeast, and will help to reduce the risk of shortages, that have high economic costs.  Moreover, the project will contribute to the economic growth in the Northeast in several ways: by bringing in and supporting foreign private investments; by creating about 1,200 jobs during construction; and by providing industrial and commercial customers with reliable capacity in a region that is extremely vulnerable to hydrological conditions.  Finally, the project will be the first efficient combined-cycle thermal power plant in the state of Ceará (which currently imports electricity over a distance of at least 700 km, resulting in high transmission loss), and will cater to about 30 percent of the state's current power demand.

IFC will be playing a critical investment mobilization role in this project through the raising of an IFC 'B' Loan from commercial banks of up to $112.5 million.  In light of the extreme cautiousness among commercial lenders in Latin America, this is a significant amount of commercial financing for a project in Brazil (particularly in the Northeast) at this time, given the evolving regulatory structure in Brazil's power sector, the continuing crisis in Argentina, and the continuing downturn of the power industry worldwide.  

By financing the TermoFortaleza project, IFC will be providing strong support to the Brazilian power sector following the recent energy crisis.  In this regard, the GOB has been working to attract investments from major international power developers because it realizes that it needs the support of large, well-capitalized companies to ensure the success of this effort.  In the context of the retreat from emerging markets of various power companies over the past 1 to 2 years, it is critical that debt financing be available to support those strategic sponsors still willing to invest in the sector in developing countries.  IFC's support of the Project will send a strong signal to the market that IFC will continue to support those international power companies that remain committed to investing in emerging markets.

Created in 1837, under the then name of Colonial Bank, the bank has gone through a number of stages of development before reaching its current incarnation.   In the 1920's the bank came under the ownership of Barclay's Bank but returned to local ownership in 1977 and took the current name of Republic Bank Limited.  Republic has ten operating subsidiaries and three associated companies. 

Republic has a strong and experienced management team with a proven track record.  Highly profitable, the bank has on average doubled profits every 4 years in the period since 1971 leading to an average ROI (return on investment) during the period of approximately 40%.  The bank's market capitalization is $1.0 billion or approximately two times book value.  As at fiscal year end September 30, 2002, the group had $3.1 billion equivalent in total assets and $496 million in total equity.  As at the same period, Republic's return on average assets and return on average equity were 2.43% and 17.3% respectively.  The bank's risk weighted capital adequacy ratio was 18.02%.

The project is to provide up to $50 million to Republic to help finance the privatization of Barbados National Bank (BNB).  Republic has received the approval of the Government of Barbados to purchase a minimum 57% shareholding in BNB.  Currently, BNB is 77% owned by the Government of Barbados, 10% owned by the National Insurance Board (another public sector agency), and 13% publicly held.  The public sector will maintain a shareholding of approximately 30% following the privatization of BNB.","","","","","","","","","Development Impact:  
-  The acquisition of BNB by Republic will facilitate regional integration of the financial services industry by enabling the largest bank in T&T to enter the lucrative Eastern Caribbean markets (Barbados and St. Lucia); and 
-  Republic's strong management, information systems and expertise will allow BNB to achieve greater diversification of products and services and ensure that it keeps up with competition in the wake of industry wide mergers and acquisitions. The BNB acquisition will further enable a strong bank from T & T to diversify its activities and to provide high quality services to customers in a wider geographic area.

Domicem,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Dominican Republic,Domicem S.A.,"Gbl Ind, Manufact, Agribus & Services",2003-05-09T04:00:00Z,2003-06-13T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"The project is to design, construct and operate a greenfield, integrated, dry process cement plant of 800,000 tons per year (tpy) clinker capacity and 900,000 tpy cement capacity at an estimated cost of $84 million in the Dominican Republic.  The Domicem plant is expected to be commissioned by May 2005 and to sell 90% of its production in the domestic market and 10% as exports.

As of March 16, 2005, there has been a modification to this project, which is covered under a new project, Domicem II  Project No.24209.  Total Project Cost has also been revised to US$113.5 million.","","","","","","","","","The IFC Role will provide the following:

-  Access to Long-term Financing.  

IFC's involvement will enable the project to obtain long-term financing with maturities otherwise unavailable in the local DR market.  As a greenfield project, Domicem requires adequate grace periods on principal repayments to ensure proper capitalization and breathing room' during construction and start-up.  IFC will also play a catalytic role by attempting to mobilize up to $21 million from foreign commercial banks who may be unfamiliar with the local DR market and political environment.  In this regard, IFC's own investment in the project is expected to provide comfort to banks.  

-  Support to Colacem.  

Colacem seeks to diversify geographically and find growth opportunities in emerging markets.  While it has formed a joint venture with strong local partners in the DR, Colacem can benefit from IFC's involvement in Domicem given that this is its first investment in Latin America.  IFC contributes, beyond its umbrella', regional knowledge and investment experience in the cement industry in the Latin America. IFC has also provided the Sponsors with input such as suggesting improvements in limestone quarry investigation, bulk sampling of raw materials for the turnkey contractor, and guarantee for Nitrogen Oxides (NOx).

-  Endorsement of CBMI as Turnkey Contractor.  

IFC has first-hand knowledge of CBMI, the Chinese turnkey contractor, which Colacem will use for the Domicem project after its successful prior collaboration with CBMI.  IFC's endorsement of CBMI would help introduce a new, low cost, competitive supplier to the Latin American market. 

Development Impact:  

The Domicem project, a joint venture between Colacem, an industry player with a solid track record and a strong group of local DR investors, is expected to improve the productivity and competitiveness of the DR cement sector.  By supplying its own clinker needs through an integrated cement operation in a country where 60% of cement is produced on the basis of imported clinker, Domicem is expected to have a competitive cost structure.  The additional production of quality cement is expected to reduce cement prices in the DR, which are among the highest in the world, to more competitive levels.    

Other development benefits of the project include best practice' technology transfer, job creation and foreign exchange generation when the project exports a portion of its production.  The project will also support infrastructure development and construction efforts, which are critical in a country prone to frequent devastation from hurricanes and in constant need of quality cement and building materials. Colacem has a track record of implementing community development programs in the communities where it operates in Italy and is committed to support similar efforts in the DR.  Domicem is expected to operate in line with superior environmental management and safeguard systems, including best practice' standards for energy efficiency.","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.  This categorization is based on the location of the cement plant in an unpopulated area, the limestone quarry is a short distance from the plant in an area previously used for grazing cattle with no apparent land acquisition issues, and the sponsor is committed and capable to run the operation in an environmentally and socially responsible manner.

In August 1993 it changed to a universal bank and, in December 1998 changed the name to the current denomination. CECV was privatized in December 1999 through an international biding process. The Montepio Geral Group from Portugal has a total of 27.4% of the share capital of CECV and is the provider of know-how and experienced management.

The project consists of a credit line of up to EUR5 million to be extended to CECV, the second largest bank in Cape Verde. The credit line will have a tenor of 5-7 years and will provide much needed foreign exchange denominated term finance to CECV and the private sector. This project is the first IFC investment in Cape Verde's financial markets.
With total assets of $122.3 million at the end of FY02, CECV increased its balance sheet by 13.9% when compared with the previous year, thereby consolidating its expansion strategy constructed on three different pillars: the expansion of the branch network, the diversification of distribution channels and a more personalized approach to its client base.

As of December 31st, 2002, CECV had a CAR of 16.0%. Despite a lower return on equity in 2002, CECV remains a profitable institution and should be able to maintain at least the FY02 profitability level. Its cash flows can sustain without any difficulty a $5 million loan from the IFC, especially as the loan will allow the bank to leverage its strong capital base to increase business.","","","","","","","","","Development Impact

The proposed project will have a significant development impact in Cape Verde. In particular, it will:
-  improve CECV corporate governance practices. IFC's name is perceived a good practitioner in this area and the bank requested IFC's assistance to develop a sound corporate governance system;
-  Channel much needed foreign exchange term-finance to Cape Verde's private sector; and,
- Encourage further investment from Portuguese companies to the archipelago, given CECV's strong Portuguese links.

IFC's Role:

This is potentially the first investment by IFC in a financial institution in Cape Verde. IFC's knowledge and experience in banking in the region is well recognized by the sponsor, and they look forward to IFC's assistance. IFC will be providing long-term funding, which is in short supply in the region. Even major banks in countries with well developed capital markets and access to foreign sources of funding have difficulty in obtaining long-term (3 years and longer) hard currency funding.  The proposed 5-7 year term facility, will allow CECV to expand its long-term activities and enhance its ability to match its foreign exchange assets and liabilities.","",This is an FI Type 2 project.

Recent changes to the Portuguese banking legislation recognized MG as a full fledged commercial bank, allowing them to boost their activities, sustained by the expansion of the branch network, restructuring of services and technological modernization. 

The new status of MG also allowed the company to start working towards the completion of one of its visions: to expand its international activities through representative offices in markets with a strong Portuguese emigrant community and with joint-venture operations to all five Portuguese speaking countries in the African continent.

Dialog was awarded a license in 1993 by the Government of Sri Lanka, through a standard application and award process, to provide GSM 900 mobile telecommunication services in the country.  

The company is 100% owned by Telekom Malaysia Berhad (TM or the sponsor) through its international subsidiary Telekom Malaysia International Sdn. Bhd. (TMI).  The company plans to expand its network to accommodate new subscribers and improve its nationwide coverage.  It also intends to improve network quality and its customer service operations as the steep growth in subscribers during the past two years has caused congestion on Dialog's network. The total project cost, covering the capital expenditure for the expansion and added working capital, is estimated to be $110 million.

The project will help improve telecommunications services in Sri Lanka by: 
-  providing much needed telecommunications infrastructure in previously underserved areas of the country (especially those areas previously closed due to civil conflict); 
-  providing a demonstration effect to foreign debt and equity providers who have been unwilling to invest as a result of civil conflict;

The project is to build, own, operate and maintain, on a BOOT basis and for 30 years, five 400kV and one 220 kV double circuit transmission lines of about 1,200 kilometers, with a capacity of about 3,000 MW.  The purpose of the transmission system is to: -  expand capacity of the grid connecting the power surplus region of East and Northeast India with the power deficit region of North India, and -  facilitate the evacuation of power from the 1,020 MW Tala Hydroelectric Project (Tala HEP) in Bhutan which is being executed by Tala Hydro Power Development Authority (THPA).","","","","","","","","","Through this project, IFC is demonstrating its continued support for the development of Indias power sector, promoting sustainable development through growth of private power projects, with synergies in the rest of the economy.  This project supports the expansion and upgrade of transmission links between power surplus East and Northeast India and the power deficit North India, and meets a long overdue need for a high capacity transmission link between the two regions.  The project also facilitates evacuation of hydropower from Bhutan and contributes not only to reducing power shortages in India, but also to the economy of Bhutan.  Improved transmission capacity between the two regions will facilitate trading of power and enhance competition in the generation sector, which could lead to potentially lower energy costs for the end consumers.  Improved electricity transmission and greater availability of power are also likely to support investments in other sectors, thereby promoting economic growth.  The successful implementation of this first, private sector transmission project may act as a model for the much-needed private investment in the countrys transmission sector.IFC would be providing TDTL with access to long-term finance in local currency, which will strengthen the financial viability of the company and the stability of the transmission tariff over the life of the project.  Additionally, the private sectors participation of transmission services is a pioneering activity in emerging markets with few sponsors pursuing investment opportunities, and with few financial institutions having the experience and ability to structure these transactions.  This is IFCs investment in the first private sector transmission project in India.

OYAK acquired majority ownership of the bank at the end of 1993 (it now owns 100%), and changed bank's name to Oyak Bank in mid-1996.  With a strong owner and conservative management, the bank has survived nearly three years of recession in Turkey as well as a devastating financial crisis in 2001/2002 which led to nearly a dozen banks being taken over by the State Deposit Insurance Fund (SDIF). Oyak Bank's merger with Sumerbank on January 11 2002, one of the banks auctioned by SDIF, is a clear sign how the Bank is committed in its growth strategy. With this merger the Bank's total assets reached around $2.1 billion (pre merger total assets were around $300 million) and total shareholder's equity amounted to roughly $228 million (as opposed to pro merger figure of $90 milion).
The project would consist of a flexible, multi-purpose facility, which would allow Oyak Bank to

Sundaram Finance Group is engaged in vehicle finance, mortgage finance, general insurance, asset management and manufacturing of auto components through various group companies.  The promoters, belonging to the larger TVS Group, hold a 37% stake in the company with the other 63% widely held by  Indian and foreign institutional investors and by retail Indian shareholders.  SFL has a fifty year track record in financing the development of the road transport industry in India especially in the four southern states.  The company continues to build its auto and truck finance business with a solid reputation.  SFL is now one of the 5 largest Non-Bank Financial Companys (NBFCs) in India and is rated AAA for its medium term obligations by ICRA and AA+ by CRISIL for its fixed deposit obligations.  SFL's shares are listed on the national stock exchange of India.

This project is to assist Sundaram Finance Limited (SFL or the company), a leading Indian non-bank financial company, to lengthen the maturity of its liability profile and broaden its funding base.  IFC intends to grant a long-term loan of up to $45 million to SFL, to be used by the company to support its growing operations primarily for increasing trucking and automobile financing needs in rural and semi-rural areas -- a segment constituting an important part of the broader SME market and a critical part of the cargo transportation infrastructure in India.","","","","","","","","","Development Impact:

This project's main development impact is to support a strong well-managed Indian financial services group and assist it to grow across its businesses.  The project will enable the company to 

-  expand lending to the truck transport segment which is an important constituent of the SME market and is gaining increasing significance with the recent improvements in road infrastructure, 

-  contribute to improving access to financial products and services in semi-rural areas of India.  

The truck financing market comprises about $1.5 billion per year in annual disbursements and encouraging greater flow of this credit to truckers in the smaller towns and semi-rural areas will assist in the sustainable growth of those economies.  

Fit With World Bank Group Strategy:

As part of IFC's regional business development strategy, we want to increase our presence in Southern India, and strengthen our relationship with leading financial institutions which can innovate and introduce new products or develop new markets.  This second investment with the Sundaram group, with its focus on southern India and range of financial services, supports the overall World Bank Group strategy.  In addition, the Sundaram group has interests in auto components, which is another priority area for business development.

IFC's Role:
IFC's role in this project is to 
-  encourage SFL to expand lending to truckers in semi-rural areas, and 
-  extend SFL's liability profile with 6 year money as against the 2-3 years funds that are easily available locally.  

SFL is a premier client and this loan will be a quality asset for IFC.  This transaction is also a potential door-opener for deals with other companies in the TVS Group, especially in the auto ancillary industry in which we see a significant role for IFC.

They will be developed in four separate phases, the first of which, the Early Oil project, was financed by IFC and EBRD in 1998 and is producing approximately 140,000 barrels of oil a day.  The second stage, called Phase 1, is currently being considered for separate financing by IFC and EBRD although the financing of the Phase 1 project will be conducted in parallel with the BTC project.  Phase 2 was sanctioned in September of 2002, while Phase 3 is in the project development stage.  Following the completion of all of the phases in 2009, the ACG field peak production of crude is expected to be over one million barrels of oil per day based on proved plus probable reserve estimates.  BTC Project Description:The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (http://www.ifc.org/btc), or BTC, pipeline will transport up to one million barrels of oil per day (bpd) of crude oil primarily from the ACG field.  The 1,760 km pipeline, which starts at the Sangachal Terminal near Baku in Azerbaijan, passes through Georgia and ends at a new marine terminal at Ceyhan on the Mediterranean coast in Turkey, is due to become operational in early 2005.ACG production is currently shipped primarily through the Western Route Export Pipeline, (WREP) completed as part of the Early Oil project, ending in Supsa, Georgia; however, the current capacity of this route is approximately 150,000 bpd.  In addition, the Northern Route pipeline to Novorossiysk, Russia has a capacity of 115,000 bpd. The BTC pipeline became a necessity because of current constraints on capacity that would limit the ability to bring ACG crude to market.  Early conceptual development of the project took into account the need for a dedicated export route for the ACG field that would not require the shipment of Caspian oil through the Bosphorus Straits thereby significantly reducing environmental risk.","","","","","","","","","Development Impact:In the widest geopolitical context, the projects will provide global markets with a new, important source of crude oil by creating an east-west energy corridor.  The BTC pipeline will provide the first direct transportation link between the hydrocarbon-rich, land-locked Caspian Sea and the Mediterranean.  It has already strengthened relations between Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey through increased cooperation on a variety of issues and through the co-dependence required to realize project benefits.  The BTC project also reflects the development of new economic and political links between the three host countries and Western Europe, e.g. Turkeys significance as the western outlet of the future east-west energy corridor and as a hub for energy distribution through the Mediterranean, to European and other international markets.  From an environmental perspective, as mentioned later, avoiding the shipment of large volumes of crude through the Turkish Straits is viewed as a significant advantage of the project.The projects have also tried to raise the bar in terms of transparency, including public disclosure.  Among the significant agreements that have been made accessible are the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA), the three Host Government Agreements (HGAs) and the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA). With prudent management, hydrocarbon revenues have the potential to improve economic conditions in Azerbaijan, assisting it in the transition from a centralized command economy to a market driven one.  It is hoped that this will contribute to political stability and ongoing processes of economic restructuring and reform in the region.  The projects principal economic benefits for each of the host countries are further discussed in attachment 2.IFC Role:-  assist in mitigating political risk perceived by international investors in the projects,-  provide long-term financing (both directly and by mobilizing commercial bank funding through its B loans) that is especially needed by the smaller project sponsor companies; -  provide a framework and oversight for the development and operation of the projects in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner; -  help enhance development impacts by IFCs linkage and community development programs (currently being developed to complement the sponsors SME and community development programs); -  assist in the transparent and effective management of the Oil Fund in Azerbaijan in coordination with the World Bank and the IMF; and help increase the transparency of the projects.","","ACG Phase 1 Project:This is a Category A project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.  Environmental and social issues associated with the project may include, but are not limited to: resettlement of one extended family from its winter grazing area, permanent displacement/relocation of one cafe/garage and some informal fishermen from part of their fishing area; alternative analysis of oil export options; avoidance, mitigation and compensation of impacts to biodiversity; the management of produced water and gas; oil spill prevention and response planning; and worker and public health and safety.  To identify and predict impacts relating to these and other issues, four separate Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) were prepared for various activities associated with the ACG project. On the basis of these ESIAs, an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) has been prepared for the project which details how impacts will be avoided, mitigated or compensated.  An ACG Phase 1 Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan (PCDP) were also prepared and have been disclosed.The few individuals directly affected by the project are being compensated according to World Bank OD 4.30 standards.

Phase 1 Project,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,Azerbaijan,Amoco Caspian Sea (Phase 1) Finance Ltd.,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2003-07-31T04:00:00Z,2003-10-30T05:00:00Z,A,Loan,"ACG Development Phase 1 Project DescriptionThe Azeri Chirag deepwater Gunashli (ACG) fields operated by BP Exploration (Caspian Sea) Limited contain an estimated 5.4 billion bbls of recoverable crude oil reserves.  They will be developed in four separate phases, the first of which, the Early Oil project, was financed by IFC and EBRD in 1998 and is producing approximately 140,000 barrels of oil a day.  The second stage, called Phase 1, is currently being considered for separate financing by IFC and EBRD although the financing of the Phase 1 project will be conducted in parallel with the BTC project.  Phase 2 was sanctioned in September of 2002, while Phase 3 is in the project development stage.  Following the completion of all of the phases in 2009, the ACG field peak production of crude is expected to be over one million barrels of oil per day based on proved plus probable reserve estimates.  BTC Project Description:The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan, or BTC, pipeline will transport up to one million barrels of oil per day (bpd) of crude oil primarily from the ACG field.  The 1,760 km pipeline, which starts at the Sangachal Terminal near Baku in Azerbaijan, passes through Georgia and ends at a new marine terminal at Ceyhan on the Mediterranean coast in Turkey, is due to become operational in early 2005.ACG production is currently shipped primarily through the Western Route Export Pipeline, (WREP) completed as part of the Early Oil project, ending in Supsa, Georgia; however, the current capacity of this route is approximately 150,000 bpd.  In addition, the Northern Route pipeline to Novorossiysk, Russia has a capacity of 115,000 bpd. The BTC pipeline became a necessity because of current constraints on capacity that would limit the ability to bring ACG crude to market.  Early conceptual development of the project took into account the need for a dedicated export route for the ACG field that would not require the shipment of Caspian oil through the Bosphorus Straits thereby significantly reducing environmental risk.","","","","","","","","","Development Impact:In the widest geopolitical context, the projects will provide global markets with a new, important source of crude oil by creating an east-west energy corridor.  The BTC pipeline will provide the first direct transportation link between the hydrocarbon-rich, land-locked Caspian Sea and the Mediterranean.  It has already strengthened relations between Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey through increased cooperation on a variety of issues and through the co-dependence required to realize project benefits.  The BTC project also reflects the development of new economic and political links between the three host countries and Western Europe, e.g. Turkeys significance as the western outlet of the future east-west energy corridor and as a hub for energy distribution through the Mediterranean, to European and other international markets.  From an environmental perspective, as mentioned later, avoiding the shipment of large volumes of crude through the Turkish Straits is viewed as a significant advantage of the project.The projects have also tried to raise the bar in terms of transparency, including public disclosure.  Among the significant agreements that have been made accessible are the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA), the three Host Government Agreements (HGAs) and the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA). With prudent management, hydrocarbon revenues have the potential to improve economic conditions in Azerbaijan, assisting it in the transition from a centralized command economy to a market driven one.  It is hoped that this will contribute to political stability and ongoing processes of economic restructuring and reform in the region.  The projects principal economic benefits for each of the host countries are further discussed in attachment 2.IFC Role:-  assist in mitigating political risk perceived by international investors in the projects;-  provide long-term financing (both directly and by mobilizing commercial bank funding through its B loans) that is especially needed by the smaller project sponsor companies; -  provide a framework and oversight for the development and operation of the projects in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner; -  help enhance development impacts by IFCs linkage and community development programs (currently being developed to complement the sponsors SME and community development programs); -  assist in the transparent and effective management of the Oil Fund in Azerbaijan in coordination with the World Bank and the IMF; and help increase the transparency of the projects.","","ACG Phase 1 ProjectThis is a Category A project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

The sponsors are part of the LNJ Bhilwara group of companies.The project is to build, own and operate a 192MW run-of-the-river hydroelectric power plant (HPP) in the Kullu District of Himachal Pradesh (Northern India).  ADPCL will operate as a base-load plant during the summer and rainy seasons, and as a peaking plant in the winter and non-monsoon months.  The project will help meet peak and energy shortages by supplying competitively priced power to the Northern Region of India.  ADPCLs Detailed Project Report received Techno-Economic Clearance on August 20, 2002 from the Central Electricity Authority at an estimated completed cost of $192 million.","","","","","","","","","This project is consistent with the WBGs strategy of promoting private investment in the power sector of India and has the following developmental impacts: -  provide peak power to the Northern grid and thereby meet peak shortages,-  help improve the hydro-thermal mix in the country, -  provide a strong demonstration effect for private merchant hydropower development, -  reduce the need for public investment and allow the government to re-deploy scarce resources to meet poverty alleviation and social development objectives, and -  aid the manufacturing sector by providing competitive and reliable power.","","The setting for the project is the steep terrain of the Himalayas, in the Kullu Valley of  India's Himachal Pradesh State.  Implementation of the project requires diversion of a portion of the flow of the Allain and Duhangan rivers, through tunnels to an underground power house with two 96MW generating units.  A small diversion structure on the Allain river will supply water to an off-stream storage reservoir that, together with water storage in both tunnels, will provide sufficient capacity for four hours of peaking generation during dry periods.

As part of its continuous expansion strategy, Metrocentro has started implementing a $55 million Multiplaza Panamericana project, to address the increasing demand for quality shopping complexes in El Salvador. The proposed new shopping mall will have a total GLA of approximately 41,000 m2; it will host two anchor tenants/department stores, movie theaters, a supermarket, restaurants, financial center and a food court. The mall is planned to become fully operational in December 2004. It will be part of a large diversified complex, including apartments, offices, and hotel, which will be developed at a later stage.  As a result, the proposed project is expected to stimulate further development of the selected location, ultimately benefiting the local community.","","","","","","","","","The proposed IFC investment in Metrocentro will enable the following: 

-  improvements in the urban infrastructure of the capital city in El Salvador; 
-  better consumer choices because the clustering of competitors facilitates comparisons of offers and improves consumers knowledge resulting in higher quality goods available at lower prices for the consumer; 
-  improvements in the quality of goods sold; 
-  increase in standards for hygiene and safety in product handling and storage;  
-  improvements in practices among local product suppliers, especially food and fresh products that filter through to other retail formats, including open air vendors; and 
-  creation of more than 5,000 direct and indirect jobs during the construction and operational stage. 

In addition, as in the Group's previous malls, the proposed project is expected to attract other development to the area, creating a demonstration effect and contributing to the overall community development. During construction of the shopping mall, strong linkages with the construction and building supply sectors will be established. In addition, once operational, the project will stimulate use of local supplies of goods and services in El Salvador, which will represent more than 40% of the shopping mall supply. 

IFC's role in Metrocentro is as follows: 

-  Supporting a successful Central American company to expand its shopping mall business in El Salvador, by establishing Multiplaza Panamericana, a good quality shopping mall and the first of its kind in El Salvador, that would improve the infrastructure in the area where it is located as well as contribute to improvements of the living standard of target customers.

A project to develop the Pande and Temane gas fields and transport gas through a 890 km pipeline to South Africa has been sponsored by Sasol.  ENH, the national petroleum company, is a 30% partner in the upstream unincorporated joint venture (UJV) which will develop the gas fields and the associated processing facilities. IFC has been invited to invest for a 5% shareholding in the UJV.","","","","","","","","","The project will  contribute to the development of Mozambique as evidenced by a over 20% economic rate of return (ERR). It will generate significant benefits in the form of royalties, taxes and profit share over its life (25 years). It will also generate significant employment during construction and a number of  permanent jobs afterwards. Moreover, the share of gas received as royalty and the development of a proposed spur line to Maputo will lay the foundation for a domestic gas market which could lead to the development of a number of gas using industries that would add to the manufacturing base and export receipts of the country. Finally, coming on the heels of the Mozal development, the project will reinforce investors' image of Mozambique as an attractive place for business development that can benefit from its resources and location.

IFC, as a member of the World Bank Group, is playing a number of important roles in this project. Firstly, along with MIGA and the PRG, IFC participation is seen as an important political risk mitigant by both Sasol and ENH. Secondly, Mozambican equity participation is important for both parties. In the absence of strong Mozambican private sector partners, ENH has to play this role. ENH has limited resources and IFC participation through a farm-in will reduce its 'equity burden.' Thirdly, ENH sees IFC's participation in the operating committee of the upstream development as a critical support to Mozambique during the period it builds up its own capacity. Fourthly, In line with GoM's request, IFC is helping to increase local participation in this project. Fifthly, IFC is working with Gigajoule Africa, which is developing a Mozambican gas distribution company in partnership with ENH and other Mozambican investors, to examine the use of carbon credits in order to improve the commercial performance of the project. Finally, IFC is working jointly with the WB to ensure that the project is built and operated to high environmental and social standards.","","This is a category A project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

IFC Role:-  Farm Forestry:  With this project, IFC will help BILT further develop its linkage program of support for smallholder forestry to raise farmer incomes, and will advise on sustainable forest management practices.  IFC''s investment will directly contribute to sustainable forestry operations. It is worth noting here that the social forest program was recommended by IFC while investing in BILT in 2000.-  Catalyst for Mobilizing Resources:  IFC has been involved with BILT since 2001 when it issued a partial guarantee for BILTs domestic bond issue. This support enabled BILT to subsequently access local capital markets on its own. IFC''s participation in this project is crucial to build investor confidence and will mobilize the participation of other financial intermediaries. Through this project, BILT will make a mark in the international financial markets and could subsequently access private capital in international capital markets on its own. It will also attract private international investors and thereby diversify BILTs shareholders.-  Corporate Finance: The company''s operations are strong, it has/is in the process of obtaining commitments to refinance approximately $95 million of Foreign and Local currency loans. IFC has made the debt refinancing a condition to the participation in the project. The debt refinancing will strengthen BILTs financial position.","","This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.

IFC and the German development financier,  Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH (DEG) are proposing to extend secured loans of up to $30 million equivalent (up to MXN180 million by IFC and up to EUR12 million by DEG) to HSC.  The proceeds of the loans will be used to fund peso-denominated bridge loans to Mexican developers for the construction of low-income housing to be sold under programs sponsored by public sector entities such as Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal (SHF), INFONAVIT and FOVITSSE.  IFC will also provide a currency swap to the company for the DEG financing.","","","","","","","","","Mexico faces a large housing deficit estimated at about 4 million units.  The lack of available funding for the construction of new homes is a principle obstacle to reducing the country's housing deficit.  SHF's discontinuation of loans to Sofols for bridge loans to developers, has aggravated this problem. IFC's proposed investment directly addresses this obstacle.  Further on, IFC considers this investment to be consistent with its overall strategy which underlies its relationship with HSC. 

Housing finance contributes to social stability by enabling households to purchase an asset which will represent their largest single investment.  This is enhanced further in the case of low-income households. 

This project is different to other IFC projects in housing finance, as it addresses supply side, rather than demand related issues.  By financing bridge loans, this project will address the housing deficit on the supply side, which will in turn enable households to access home ownership, through the existing housing finance channels.  Housing markets have significant economic linkages as housing construction and housing related sectors represent approximately 9% of the labor force worldwide.  The linkages include land markets, building materials, tools, durable goods and labor markets. This project will enable job creation in the housing and construction sectors.","","This is an FI Type 1 project.

-  Healthcare.  
Overall healthcare expenditures in Turkey have historically been quite low, which has resulted in a health care system that provides poor quality and inefficient services to the Turkish population.

IFC Role:

-  Corporate Governance.   
IFC's investment will be conditioned on increased independence of Meteksan from other group companies.  This will allow the company to optimize its capital structure and more aggressively pursue growth.

-  Demonstration Effect.  
The project would be IFC's first investment in a Turkish technology firm.  An IFC investment at this time would support a later-stage technology company that has successfully grown to become one of the leading IT companies in Turkey.  It would also provide the company with capital in a difficult financing environment.  Following the 2001 financial crisis, it has been extremely difficult for Turkish companies to obtain hard currency credit, and it is still difficult for companies to raise financing from sources outside of Turkey.

OPET Petrolculuk,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,Türkiye,OPET PETROLCULUK AS,Regional Industry MAS MCT,2003-09-22T04:00:00Z,2003-10-23T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"Opet Petrolcülük A.S. (Opet or the company) is a retail distributor of petroleum products in Turkey, owned 50% by the Koç Group of Turkey and 50% by Opets founding shareholders, the Ozturk family.  The project is aimed at strengthening the companys position in the Turkish petroleum products distribution industry and enhancing its competitiveness in advance of further liberalization.  The project is comprised of :-  the construction of a greenfield marine terminal and tank storage facility which will increase the companys oil products storage capacity from 320,000 m3 to 766,000 m3; and,-  expansion of the companys existing retail distribution network, with new stations primarily located in the larger cities of Turkey.  The distribution expansion network will enhance the companys brand recognition in the lucrative Istanbul, Izmir and other larger retail markets. In addition, the project will enable Opet to import larger parcels of products, store in-house, reduce transportation costs and improve the reliability of supply, while simultaneously supporting growth in its fuel distribution business. Opet hopes to take advantage of its strategic location at the mouth of the Black Sea to offer bunkering facilities for Caspian oil products. The intense sea traffic in the region will also give Opet the opportunity to purchase low-cost petroleum products.","","","","","","","","","Development Impact:The proposed project will have a number of beneficial impacts, including:-  enhancing the long-term viability of a Turkish company which operates in a cyclical industry;  Opet will gain economies of scale, improve its operating efficiencies, and raise standards resulting in potentially lower fuel prices to consumers when the market liberalizes;  -  increasing competition in the automotive LPG and retail petroleum and products sectors;  -  enhancing existing retail distribution offerings and providing cleaner roadside facilities to consumers in the Istanbul and Marmara regions; -  enhancing investor confidence in working with a strong Turkish company;-  putting the company in a position to take advantage of the market liberalization anticipated under the New Petroleum Law; -  allowing oil products to be stored and distributed in compliance with EU quality standards;-  allowing Opet to demonstrate its commitment to sustainable business practices;       -  allowing Opet to continue to be one of the more significant tax paying entities in Turkey.IFC Role:The IFC investment will enable the company to lower its funding cost and secure funding of longer maturities, thus stabilizing its cash flow through periods of cyclicality.  Current market conditions in Turkey do not indicate that alternative sources of long-term finance will be available anytime soon. Under these conditions only larger multinational players such as BP and Shell have access to finance for the upgrading and modernization of their distribution networks.  IFC has a key role to play in the mobilization of long-term capital under the IFC B Loan program and in assisting parallel lenders such as FMO and DEG.  The proposed B Loan aims to provide reasonably priced long-term financing, which is important not only for ensuring profitability in an increasingly competitive domestic distribution market, but also for positioning the company to take advantage of changes in the market expected under the New Petroleum Law.  IFC has provided in depth advice on marketing and technical issues pertaining to the proposed Marmara marine terminal, as well as an important role in ensuring proper environmental compliance.  Finance facilities provided to the project will also help remove the need for petroleum product distributors in the Thrace region to transport supplies over the two Bosphorous bridges by tanker.","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria. The review of this project consisted of appraising technical, environmental and social information submitted by Opet as well as visits to the proposed terminal site on the Sea of Marmara and the existing Opet terminal in Ismit.  The following potential environment, health, safety and social impacts of the projects were analyzed.-  Site selection and land acquisition;-  Compliance of the marine terminal and storage facilities with IFC, international, and Turkish environmental,      health and safety (EHS) requirements; and      -  Labor and community issues.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityThe Opet environmental documents will be posted in the following places for local disclosure:-  at the corporate headquarters in Istanbul; and  -  at the site of the proposed terminal.","Opet Shareholder Structure:From its inception in 1992 through November 2002, Opet was owned 100% by the Ozturk family, which had over 20 years trading experience in the Turkish petroleum sector.  In  December 2002, the Koç Group purchased 50% of Opets shares from the Ozturk family for $125 million.  The Ozturk family collectively retained 50% of the outstanding shares.

Total revenues for 2002 were approximately $115 million.  The Company was formed in 1994 as a joint venture between Korea Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. of Korea, local Chinese partners and a consortium of investors.  IFC financed the initial green-field project and is now contemplating the financing of the expansion.The companys current nameplate capacity is 3 million tires per annum, which is insufficient for them to meet demand.  In 2002, the company produced almost 5 million tires, by increasing its working days and shifts, optimizing process flow and substituting bias tire production capacity with radial tire production.  The project is to expand the companys nameplate capacity to 8 million tires per annum, with expectations that it can produce up to 10 million tires on the equipment. The company has a 12% share in the national radial tire market share with strong penetration in the south and east regions of China.  The expansion project will enable to company to meet ongoing demand for tires, and also to produce to a quality standard adequate to meet the requirements of the most advanced OEM customers in China.  NKT will also continue to export a portion of its tires.  The company has had strong financial results in recent years, and intends to finance a portion of the project through internally generated cash flow.","","","","","","","","","The project contributes to the restructuring of Chinas tire industry, which is a key element of the Chinese governments plan to develop the domestic automotive sector as well as a modern parts and components industry.  NKTs plan to enter the northern market of China will promote competition in that regional market.  The project also benefits from utilizing the technological and marketing expertise of KTC.  NKT currently has 1,558 staff which are projected to increase to 2,081 over the project period.NKT will create jobs.  In addition, the increased economic output will create wealth in NKTs value chains which include domestic Chinese suppliers of raw materials and outsourced components, as well as providers of transport, installation and after sales service.  In particular, attention will be given to strengthening the linkages with the SMEs which form part of NKTs aftermarket distribution network.  The expansion will generate economies of scale and will bring in new technology, enabling the company to meet the quality requirements of Chinas leading automotive OEMs.  Finally, the success of the project will provide a demonstration effect, which will encourage further foreign direct investment into China.IFCs role in the project includes the following:- to structure the investment and provide long-term capital, mobilize co-financing, including long-term loans from local banks;- to support technology transfer, leading to improved efficiency, quality standards and profitability;- to support ongoing environmental performance at the company;- to support and develop the companys linkages with distributor SME companies, increasing benefits in the local economy.  Such a program might include management training, consulting, and MIS development.  In this regard, IFC will leverage its experience in other tire distribution linkage programs developed in the project development facilities.","","The companys environmental performance at its existing operation has been adequate for the last three annual reporting cycles.

(BCR or the bank) was incorporated in 1990 and licensed by the National Bank of Romania to conduct all commercial banking activities.  BCR is the largest bank in Romania, with a market share of more than one third of total banking assets in the country as of year-end 2002.  According to International Accounting Standards (IAS), BCR's  total assets as of December 31, 2002 were approximately $4.7 billion equivalent, total equity was approximately $846 million equivalent, and net profits were approximately $106 million equivalent.  The project consists of a pre-privatization equity investment of up to $111 million for a 12.5% shareholding in the bank.  The pre-privatization equity investment fits within a wider framework to support the Government of Romania (GoR or the Government) to promote banking sector reform.","","","","","","","","","Development Impact:

The restructuring and privatization of banks continues to be a costly, though essential, exercise through Eastern and Central Europe.  Efficient intermediation of savings into productive investments is vital to the future growth of the region.  Given the relatively limited alternative vehicles for intermediation, the banking sector has a disproportionately significant role to play.  By supporting the privatization of the largest bank in Romania, IFC's developmental impact is expected to be particularly high.  Enhancing the credibility of the bank privatization process is particularly important in Romania as it is a key pillar in the Government's overall privatization program.

IFC Role-  Lending credibility of the privatization process:

IFC has successfully supported high profile bank privatizations in several of Europe's transition economies.  The project is expected to replicate this success and lend credibility to the BCR transaction within the context of the GoR's privatization program for the financial sector.  The delays in BCR's privatization resulting from the global economic slowdown make this a challenging privatization, one where the signaling effect of multilateral support is particularly significant.  The project is expected to catalyze increased investor interest and improve terms and conditions for BCR's privatization.
 
Strengthening BCR's institutional capacity and enhancing its operational profile:

IFC's involvement with BCR prior to the sale to a privatization investor will enable IFC to play a role in strengthening the Bank's operations by requiring the implementation of an Institution Building Plan (IBP) jointly developed by EBRD and IFC.  The objective of the IBP is to strengthen BCR's corporate governance and operations (including upgrades to its systems and risk management), thereby preparing it for full privatization by the end of 2006.","",This is a Financial Intermediary (FI) Type 1 project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.

The Fund will have a global focus.,"","","","","","","","","Through its participation in the Fund, IFC will seek to achieve development impact in several ways.  The Fund will respond to an inefficiency that is common to stock markets in developing as well as developed economies:  as a general rule, investors and market researchers tend to pay less attention to smaller companies.  This is particularly the case for companies that are listed but do not form part of the most commonly used market indexes and, therefore, do not automatically get picked up by investors who want their portfolios to track the market.  As a result, market analysts pay less attention to these stocks, which reduces their visibility to investors and consequently limits trading volumes and liquidity.   By demonstrating the value of analyzing and investing in these companies, the Fund will contribute to increasing liquidity in this asset sub-class, which is expected to expand the range of stocks available to investors, attract a broader range of local and foreign investors and encourage greater coverage by market analysts.

IFC will play a catalyst role in attracting other investors to the Fund.  By giving a green light to the project, IFC will serve as an anchor investor, attracting private sector investors that otherwise might not invest in the Fund.   In line with the lessons learned from prior funds, IFC's investment in the Fund will demonstrate our commitment to supporting existing managers with a good track record.","","This is a category C project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.

As of June 30, 2003 RSB had the net worth of $61 million and total assets of $247 million equivalent and is in the process of increasing its capital by additional $20 million.  Proceeds of the IFC financing would be used to expand RSB's consumer lending and to help prepare the Bank for securitization of some of its consumer loans in 2004.","","","","","","","","","Consumer finance is one of the most promising sectors in the Russian banking. However, access to funding remains a serious constraint to consumer lending expansion and RSB continues to have limited access to financing sources.  By providing much-needed funding to RSB, IFC would both promote consumer lending development in Russia and support an existing client.  IFC support would be in large part used for expansion of RSB's activities in the regions, where demand for retail banking services is even greater than in Moscow.

As the Russian economy continues to stabilize, more successful banks and companies increasingly rely on ruble-denominated assets.  Borrowing in dollars exposes these companies to a currency risk.  Therefore, many current and potential IFC clients, including RSB, have expressed interest in ruble financing.  In response to this request, the proposed loan package may include a ruble-denominated component.

Specifically, IFC's financing will: 
-  Provide funds for expansion of consumer lending in Moscow and regions of Russia through a convenient,               flexible structure.

Cairn Corporate,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,South Asia,Southern Asia Region,Cairn India Holdings Limited,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2003-11-04T05:00:00Z,2003-12-09T05:00:00Z,B,Loan,"Cairn Energy PLC (Cairn or the company) is a growing oil and gas company in the United Kingdom, with a strong focus on India and Bangladesh (96% of reserves.)  Over the last few years, it has carried out a strong exploration and appraisal program, which has now started to yield significant discoveries.  As a result, Cairn has turned its attention to the development of its assets.  The company has asked IFC for a seven-year $40 million revolving corporate facility to finance their growing development expenditure needs in India and Bangladesh.","","","","","","","","","Development Impact-  Promoting development of domestic oil and gas resources:  Cairns operations will contribute to developing India''s scarce domestic gas reserves, as well as Bangladeshs domestic gas market. India is the world''s sixth largest energy consumer, but is strongly deficit in oil and gas. In the case of Bangladesh, demand for gas in the domestic market continues to grow and Cairn is supporting this demand.-  Enhancing availability of higher quality fuel: India''s power sector is strongly dependent on more expensive naphtha supplies or relatively inferior coal brought from India''s central and eastern states. Cairns activities strengthen the availability of locally produced fuel sources for power generation and for small industry.  Increasing availability of fuel sources, especially gas, offers advantages of promoting use of a more clean and convenient fuel.  -  Promoting private sector participation in India:  Since the mid nineties, India has implemented policy changes to encourage private and foreign investment in its E&P sector. Although success remains modest, a number of quality foreign companies such as Cairn have successfully entered the sector and seek to grow their operations. IFC''s investment will help support growing foreign investment and private sector role in the upstream Indias hydrocarbons sector. Dedicated foreign investment in Bangladesh:  Lack of an export market for gas in Bangladesh has led many foreign investors to cease investment in the country.  Cairn remains dedicated to Bangladesh, focusing on the development of the countrys domestic market, through its interest in the producing Sangu gas field and other exploration blocks.Direct economic benefits:  The governments of India and Bangladesh will receive payments from royalties, production sharing and corporate taxes.IFC RoleIFC will support the development of a dynamic oil and gas company with a strong focus  in Indias liberalizing E&P sector and on Bangladesh, where appropriate harnessing of its gas resources could make a significant impact on economic development.  IFC plays a number of important roles in this investment: -  Firstly, IFC will provide longer term financing to Cairn than is available from the market. -  Secondly,  IFCs  financing  gives comfort on political risk issues as the company becomes more a long-term investor in India and Bangladesh, again because of its transition to a developer and producer of oil and gas (rather than only exploration). International E&P companies have faced difficulties in Bangladesh and Cairn hopes to benefit from  the WB Groups broader  dialogue with the country on the energy sector. -  Thirdly, IFC has conducted a full-fledged audit of the standards and capacity of Cairn in the area of environment and social impact of its operations. If necessary, IFC will work with Cairn to upgrade its environmental standards and capacity. -  Finally, given the fact that Cairns major assets are gas reserves, IFC will support the development of gas as a clean and competitive fuel.","","This corporate loan facility is a category B project according to IFCs environment and social review procedure.

CGL's business operations are organized into four Strategic Business Groups (SBGs) namely power systems, industrial systems, consumer products, and digital (networking and telecommunication). The net turnover of the company in FY03 was $328 million equivalent.

The proposed corporate investment and debt restructuring program would enable CGL to further cut costs and enhance the competitiveness of its products in both domestic and international markets and increase the average maturity of CGL's debt.

Local Development: 
CGL is moving its operations from high costs areas (e.g., Mumbai) to low cost less developed areas. The manufacturing operations will help local economies not only through employment but also through the consumption of privately contracted specialty services, operations and maintenance assistance etc. 

Benefits to Employees: 
The project will ensure continued employment for several thousand people, despite rationalization in Mumbai, as well as generate new jobs in low income areas. Formal training, an important benefit to employees, combined with the on-job work experience, will allow workers to increase their skills and improve their earning potential.

IFC's role in this project is manifold. IFC would provide access to much needed long-term capital to assist CGL in implementing the ongoing modernization and restructuring, and in refinancing the company's high-cost maturing debt, as other sources of long-term financing are generally not available to CGL in the current market scenario. IFC presence would support the turnaround strategy. This would help the company obtain a favorable credit rating in due course and enable it to access the Indian bond market for long-term funds on a sustainable basis in the future.

(Drujba) is the result of the merger in April 2003 of Stind A.D. (Stind; located in Sofia) and Drujba (which originally consisted solely of a plant at Plovdiv, in southern Bulgaria), both of which have been owned by Yioula Glassworks S.A (Yioula), Greece, since their privatizations in 1997 and in 1998, respectively. In 2002, the combined sales of Drujba were Euro 46.9 million ($ 49.8 million) and net earnings amounted to Euro 5.4 million ($ 5.7 million).  

After the merger, the company's share of the Bulgarian market is about 72%. The combined capacity at the two plants (after full commissioning of the new furnace in early 2004) will be approximately 264,000 tons per year.  The merger of Drujba's original Plovdiv and Stind operations aimed at more efficient production planning, better capacity utilizations, and more efficient use of management time. Although the sponsor had sought the merger several years ago it was delayed due to lengthy regulatory requirements of Bulgaria's State Securities Commission and various other regulatory agencies.

The proposed project is to refurbish and modernize the operations of an existing Bulgarian glass manufacturer, Drujba.  The project involves an investment in a modern 120,000 tpy natural gas fired furnace and related production lines at the company's plant in Plovdiv.   Capacity at the company's Sofia operation will not increase.","","","","","","","","","The proposed project will allow Drujba to improve its production in order to meet the more stringent requirements of the EU and neighboring markets in terms of specifications and quality, while maintaining its dominant position in Bulgaria.  

Drujba is already a lower cost supplier to its local and export markets and is expected to further lower its production costs by implementing the project. The project represents a low cost expansion of effective capacity.

The proposed project will have a positive environmental and social impact.  The Dujba plants originally consisted of old equipment and congested workspace.  The company's investment program will upgrade the overall environmental standards and allow both plants to realize about 60% to 75% energy savings and increase the amount of recycled glass used.  It will also improve the working conditions of the employees.

The proposed project will encourage the development of local enterprises in a commercial way by supporting a small machine tool and mold manufacturer.

IFC's Role:
IFC supports Bulgaria's privatization efforts by focusing on financing recently privatized enterprises, and by supporting manufacturing opportunities in various sectors which have strategic importance for Bulgaria.  

IFC's role in the proposed project involves: 

--providing long-term funding which is not readily available from local financial institutions; 
--supporting environmental sustainability and higher health and safety standards, 
--establishing a relationship with a reputable sponsor who has further expansion plans in other emerging markets (e.g. Serbia and Romania), 
--helping the company address its accounting issues, and 
--assisting the company to develop an improved capital structure.","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

The IFC investment will assist in the development of the micro and small business enterprise sector in the Kyrgyz Republic by augmenting financing to existing MSEs. It will also have a strong institution-building role. By providing Ineximbank with training and technical assistance, the project will seek to address the shortage of banking skills that are necessary to establish a market-based banking environment, especially with respect to MSEs.

-  Upgrading business practices:  The project will have a catalytic effect in developing and improving the quality of  local suppliers and producers.  Since part of the product range is expected to be sourced locally, the company will
have to work closely with local suppliers and producers to improve their quality in order to meet NL's quality standards.  
-  Promoting SME and private sector development:  The project would have a positive effect on the development of the home repair/improvement and construction services industry, which was underdeveloped during the years of state planning.  
-  Demonstration effect:  The project would provide a significant demonstration effect, as its success would encourage other companies pursuing investment opportunities in Ukraine, as the country' s perceived risk begins to diminish.

The NBFCs receiving these funds will use them to on-lend to the Small and Meduim Enterprise (SME) sector in the form of leases or medium term loans.  IFC's local currency guarantee is also expected to lengthen the debt maturities of the selected NBFCs and help reduce maturity mismatches by allowing these companies to partially retire existing short term debt.,"","","","","","","","","Foreign investment in Pakistan has been negatively impacted by recent tension in the region.  Through the facility, IFC will play a catalytic role in supporting the SME sector and evolution of a few selected NBFCs.   IFC's participation will attract the participation of  major commercial banks to lend on a longer tenor to NBFCs.  It will also create a new source of medium term funding for selected NBFCs.

IFC's role in this project is:
- to encourage Pakistan NBFC's to expand lending to SME's and 
- extend the term funding available to NBFCs to 5-7 years as against the 2-3 year funds that are currently available to them.  Local banks remain risk averse for longer maturity lending, especially for leasing companies which are operating in a highly competitive environment.","","This is an FI Type 1 project. The borrower will be required to develop an environmental management system. The borrowers must require that investments under relevant operations meet host country environmental, health and safety requirements. IFC will assess the borrower''s capacity for environmental review and will provide training as necessary.Location of environmental documents in locally affected community","NBFC's play a pivotal role in mobilizing savings in the Pakistani financial system accepting term deposits of differing maturities and providing financing to a variety of sectors of the economy, with SMEs and consumer being the areas of especial focus.  Parallel to the broader banking sector, in the early 1990's, the financing activities of these institutions registered healthy growth under the market reforms instituted.  In 2000 NBFC's were able to report Prs.351.7 billion in assets ($6.1 billion equivalent) and Prs.93.3 billion in public deposits ($1.6 billion).  During this period NBFCs in Pakistan underwent a significant shakeout due to a program of comprehensive financial sector reform which included: 
- liberalization of the foreign exchange market and interest rates; 
- increased autonomy to the central bank and its focus on monetary policy and banking supervision; 
- establishment of an independent regulatory department at Securities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) for capital markets and NBFCs; 
- upgrading of legal and regulatory frameworks; 
- reduction of NPLs in the banking sector, and 
- restructuring of government-owned financial institutions.  

Recognizing the role that NBFC's play in mobilization of long-term savings and sustainable investment in Pakistan, IFC intends to use this project to support the business development of a select group of NBFCs.  The provision of long-term local currency funding will enable these NBFC's to offer improved access to financial services for SMEs, and in turn support a key growth sector of the Pakistan economy.","The proposed investment will be structured as a local currency credit line, partially guaranteed by IFC.  The credit line is expected to be between $30-50 million, with a tenor of 5-7 years, including up to a 2 year grace period.

Hence the proposed structure of an IFC guarantee facility is more appropriate for the clients.  Against IFC's guarantee, one or two commercial banks will extend Pakistan Rupee loans to the NBFCs.

CCAP, with a potential shareholding of 45-50% in the GP, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Colony Capital ('Colony').  Colony is led by its founder and CEO, Thomas J. Barrack, Jr. (56), and ten other principals, who on average have worked at Colony for eight years with an average of 22 years of relevant business and investing experience.  Colony is one of a few unaffiliated, privately-held distressed asset fund organizations having the capability to source, execute and realize investment opportunities in the global markets.  

SIIC, a potential shareholder with 45-50% stake in the GP, is incorporated in Hong Kong with executive headquarters in Shanghai.  SIIC has been the 'window' company of the Shanghai Municipal Government since 1981, with the core mandate of attracting global capital to Shanghai.  Its flagship operating entity, Shanghai Industrial Holdings Ltd., is a Hong Kong-listed Hang Seng Index company, 40% owned by the public.  SIIC's total assets of over $4.1 billion (as of December 31, 2002) are invested in real estate, financial services, health care, consumer retailing, infrastructure and logistics, information technology, and the Chongming Development Area.  With a dozen offices across China and nine international offices, SIIC has sought to combine local knowledge with global expertise in various sectors through alliances with international players, including Temasek, Salomon Smith Barney and Goldman Sachs.

CCAP and SIIC are also committed to ensuring an optimal alignment of all investor's interests by investing an aggregate of up to 10% of the fund's total capitalization.  If IFC participates in the GP, 10% of IFC's total commitment would count toward this GP obligation.

CCAP has been in discussion with various Asian and U.S. institutional investors about participating in the fund.  Initial feedback indicates that IFC's involvement in the fund is viewed by those institutions as essential to validate the fund concept and mitigate certain risks.","The project entails an equity investment of the lower of :

Sokhna Port Development Company,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Middle East and North Africa,"Egypt, Arab Republic of",DP WORLD SOKHNA,Regional Industry - INF ME & Africa,2004-01-13T05:00:00Z,2004-02-19T05:00:00Z,B,Loan,"The Sokhna Port Development Company (SPDC or the company) operates the Port of North El Sokhna (Sokhna or the Port) under a 25-year concession agreement awarded in mid-1999.  The Port began commercial operations in October, 2002, and is the first fully private port operating in Egypt.  It provides a deep water facility able to handle post-panamax vessels serving the Cairo area as well as the Suez Special Economic Zone (SSEZ), a 9,000 ha industrial development zone being developed adjacent to the Port.  The Port benefits from a strategic location close to the southern entrance of the Suez Canal where it can become a gateway for cargo between Egypt and Asia as well as East Africa.  

The proposed project is to help finance the company's 2001  2004 equipment and civil works investments.  The project will help complete the first two phases of the company's operating plan for the container, bulk, general cargo, and fertilizer terminals at the Port and increase the container terminal's capacity to 250,000 TEUs per year.","","","","","","","","","The project's development impact will be substantial as Sohkna develops into the gateway of choice for Egyptian trade to and from Asia and the Middle East.  Asian and Middle Eastern cargo volumes are expected increase in the future, but a lack of adequate port facilities could restrict growth.  The proposed IFC investment will strengthen the Egyptian port sector by providing a well managed and efficient container and general cargo facility.  This, in turn, will give shipping lines and shippers a significant incentive to call on Sokhna to avoid additional costs and delays of navigating through the Suez Canal to call on Mediterranean ports.  Sokhna's improved customs procedures, EDI systems and increased productivity will also incentivize other Egyptian and regional ports to improve their procedures and efficiency.  This should lower the delivered cost of both imported and exported goods and stimulate new export activities, thereby benefiting shippers, shipping lines and consumers alike.  New export activities would also improve Egypt's balance of trade and bring foreign currency to Egypt. 

The project will provide revenues to the Government of Egypt (GOE) in the form of fees paid to the Red Sea Port Authority and additional employment and upgrading of skills for local employees.  Furthermore, the development of Sokhna will encourage further development of the SSEZ as well as warehousing, light/medium manufacturing and regional distribution, thus enhancing economic activity in the region and providing greater employment opportunity for the local population.  As the first privately owned and operated port facility in Egypt, Sokhna will also improve the transfer of know-how from international port experts to the local management and staff.

IFC's funding would support GOE's efforts in attracting private capital to public infrastructure.  IFC's funding would also bring foreign currency lending at a tenor which is essential for this project but not available from local or other foreign sources.  This would provide a strong demonstration effect for future similar projects as a market based limited recourse financing for an Egypt based infrastructure project with local sponsors. The sponsors have asked for IFC's participation to benefit from IFC's accumulated experience in structuring successful financing arrangements and in advising with terminal operations.","","This is a Category B project.  The review of this project consisted of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the project completed by the Dutch consultants Solid Waste Consultancy B.V., discussions with staff who visited the project site, and a telephone conversation and information exchange with the Sokhnas Security, Safety and Environmental Manager.  The following potential environmental, health, and safety impacts of the project were analyzed: -  environmental, health and safety management -  site selection; -  maintenance dredging; -  stormwater management; -  handling and storage of dangerous cargos and hazardous materials; -  waste management; -  emissions to air; and -  emergency response planning and preparedness.

Many of the species of flora and fauna in the reserve were discovered there and some have not been found elsewhere in Peru.Despite Inka Terra S.A.s desire to promote forest conservation, the IER has remained largely unmanaged because the company has been largely occupied with running its tourism operations.

A transcontinental road has been built on the back (north) of the reserve, going to Brazil.  Since it is still a dirt road it does not have heavy traffic yet, but it has nonetheless facilitated encroachment upon the reserve.  The threat of logging has also been exacerbated by the road. Furthermore, several communities have arisen on the border of the IER.

RZB has a strong commitment to this region and has in many cases been one of the first foreign banks to invest.  Unlike many other foreign banks in the region, RZB has developed a clear focus on local customers.

The countries in which Raiffeisen International operates are still poorly served by their banks. The banking contribution to GDP in the more developed markets of Raiffeisen International (Czech Republic and Slovenia) is at the level of approximately 50%. This is still low relative to developed countries such as Austria or Germany where the comparable figure is over 100%. This shows that there is still significant growth potential and also a development lag.   In addition, other countries in Raiffeisen International's portfolio lag further behind in terms of banking development.  IFC's support of a well-run bank in these countries will have an important developmental impact.","",This is an FI Type 1 project.

AP Paper Mills,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,South Asia,India,INTERNATIONAL PAPER APPM LIMITED,Regional Industry - MAS Asia & Pac,2004-02-17T05:00:00Z,2004-05-01T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"The Andhra Pradesh Paper Mills limited (APPM, or the company), with sales of about 157,000 MT per annum of paper, is the fourth largest integrated pulp and paper manufacturer in India.  The company was established in 1920 and is listed on the Mumbai and Hyderbad Stock Exchanges.  In October 2000, APPM acquired 71% stake in Coastal Papers Ltd. (CP) with a capacity of 55,000 MT p.a. of printing and writing paper from straw pulp and packaging paper from waste paper and newsprint.  With the proposed project, it will focus on shifting CPs production to printing and writing paper based on pulp transferred from APPM.  The proposed project consists of:-  enhancement of pulp capacity -  improvement of the product mix -  increase in production capacity and efficiency -  improvement of environmental management systems and       -  increase in the existing farm forestry program.  The project also includes the restructuring of part of the companys existing short-term debt and the recent completion of the companys privatization through the purchase of the remaining government shares.","","","","","","","","","Development Impact:Farm Forestry:  IFCs Industry, Environment and Social Specialists have visited APPMs farm forestry nurseries and plantations.  Since 1989, APPM has distributed quality seedlings to more than 14,000 farmers to cover a total plantation land of more than 27,000 hectares.  The company maintains twelve nurseries and employs 50 to 100 workers per nursery.  The total target seedling production for FY03 is 35 million.  Approximately 70,000 person days of labor are required for this, which will generate about Rs 4.2 million in wages for local laborers.  APPM also provides technical know-how to farmers from low cost planting to post harvest stage, through establishment of demonstration plots, audio, video and printed literature, and personal interactions with the farmers.  With this project, APPMs requirement for wood resources is expected to increase by over 33%, and the company will further increase its farm forestry program.Environment:  IFCs Industry and Environmental Specialists have visited APPMs plants and have identified significant environmental benefits of the Project.  In the Coastal Paper unit of the company, the existing 10,500 MT p.a. rice straw pulping section that is heavily polluting, will be closed down.  This will be replaced by pulp from the new Pulp Mill at APPM.  The Project will also help to achieve better pollution controls in the APPM plant.  The new Pulp Mill will bring down absorbable organohalogens (AOX) in the effluent discharge from present levels of 2kg per MT of pulp to 0.5 kg per MT, and reduce APPMs water consumption and odoriferous emissions to comply with the World Bank guidelines.  This will build on the companys existing green platform and allow it to continue to pursue its commitment to the environment.Employment:  APPM will provide direct employment to about 3,200 people, out of which 480 employees will work in the proposed Pulp Mill.  Additionally, with the increased wood fiber requirements as a result of the Project, APPMs farm forestry operations are expected to support over 25,200 farmers and cover over 50,000 hectares of land by 2007.IFC RoleLong term funding:  IFC will provide long term debt, which is generally not available and without which, it would not be possible to complete the financial plan.  In so doing, IFC will play an important role in stabilizing the companys debt profile, ensuring a proper match of cash from operations with debt service requirements.  APPM believes that IFCs involvement as a lead financier will help attract other local banks for lending long term in the current market scenario.  IFC will also inject additional equity in the company, which will provide needed support to the companys financial plan.Promoting sustainability:  IFCs environmental requirements for forest management will mitigate potential environmental problems and lead to sustainable forestry operations.  IFC is expected to assist the company to comply with the new World Bank Groups Forest Strategy and Policy.  The companys farm forestry operations offer a good example of development at the local farm level.  The closure of a straw pulp process will stop high pollution levels.","","This is a category B project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.  Environmental and social issues which were reviewed as part of the appraisal of this investment included:  implementation of an Environmental Management System to cover all operations; compliance with air emissions, wastewater effluents and solid waste handling requirements;  worker health and safety; implementation of social programs; and compliance of forest harvesting operations with IFC policy and guidelines.  The review found that all operations will be managed in compliance with the World Bank Group policies and guidelines.

The project is to establish a 1 million tons per annum export-oriented merchant metallurgical coke production plant at a total cost of $119 million. Coke, made from coal, is a major reactive material for iron smelting and its demand is linked to downstream steel production. IFC is requested to provide a loan of up to $70 million.","","","","","","","","","
Development Impact: The project supports the restructuring of the coke production sector in which China has a strong comparative advantage. In line with the Chinese government's efforts towards modernizing the industry and phasing out notoriously polluting beehive coke production units, the sponsor intends to substitute sales of coke from such facilities with production from a modern plant under their control. The high impact of this project comes from the sponsor's strong orientation towards an environmentally friendly and sustainable long-term business model. It will further the development of a competitive local company in the interior Shanxi Province of China through increased industrial activity, job creation, and an increase in the direct and indirect demand for goods and services.

IFC Role:  Although there has been a significant increase in credit growth in China recently, private companies still experience difficulty accessing large loans on a long-term basis for projects in the interior of China. The sponsor has the ambition to develop into a globally competitive coke producer. Despite its solid reputation, it operates in a heavy industry in the poorer interior of China and therefore needs IFC's long-term financing which will enable the project to maintain a sound balance sheet. Given its long-term goal of listing the project company abroad, it seeks partnership with IFC not only for the provision of long-term capital but also for IFC's capacity to share best practices in environmental management and corporate governance.","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result that can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

The EBFP will work with FIs to introduce best practice SME finance tools and training, as well as with SMEs to build local capacity to develop and support viable business plans. The EBFP will proactively develop the GEF-eligible SME market through market assessments, know-how sharing and best practice dissemination, as well as through activities that expand market size and scope, and raise consumer awareness.  In addressing the key obstacles (lack of access to financing, limited capacity and a weak supportive environment), the EBFP aims to create a market for sustainable, mainstream GEF-eligible SMEs.

Banque Internationale Arabe de Tunisie,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Middle East and North Africa,Tunisia,BANQUE INTERNATIONALE ARABE DE TUNISIE,Regional Industry - FIG Africa,2004-03-10T05:00:00Z,2004-04-15T04:00:00Z,FI,Loan,"The project comprises of up to $50.0 million subordinated loan to Banque Internationale Arabe de Tunisie (BIAT or the bank). BIAT is the largest private bank and the third largest bank in Tunisia in terms of asset size ($2.3 billion) and equity ($186 million). BIAT operates as a full-service bank, offering corporate/SME banking services as well as consumer banking through a network of 100 branches and 72 ATM's.  Founded through the merger in April 1976 of the local branch operations of the British Bank of the Middle East and of the French bank Société Marseillaise de Crédit, it is listed on the Tunis and London (through GDRs). BIAT is characterized by a widely diversified ownership. European and Arab banks together hold about 28% of BIAT's shares, Tunisian institutions almost 26%, and private Tunisian investors the remainder. 

BIAT's capitalization-- although adequate by Tunisian standards, with a BIS solvency ratio of 9%, exceeding the minimum Tunisian regulatory requirement of 8%--is on a declining trend.  With loan growth expected to continue at over 10%, in line with BIAT's market-share objectives, there is a critical need for  BIAT to enhance its equity to meet its growing volume of activity.  IFC's loan will partially meet this need.  IFC's proposed subordinated loan is expected to count as Tier II capital and will bolster BIAT's capital base and facilitate its growth particularly in the consumer and SME segments. More importantly, the proposed transaction is expected to serve as an enabling element for Tunisian banks as it will represent the first Tier II capital instrument to be introduced in the sector.","","","","","","","","","The project will have the following impacts on development:

-  Impact on Customers: 
the proposed loan will allow BIAT to provide new products and additional loans to existing clients, particularly to SMEs, as well as expand in the more profitable consumer and personal banking area.  Customers will therefore benefit from increased access to financing sources possibility at competitive rates. 

-  Impact on Financial Sector: 
BIAT is considered the most sophisticated Tunisian bank. It is the leading customer-deposit collector through product innovation and sophisticated marketing.  By expanding its presence in the market, BIAT is likely to improve practices and standards in the financial sector. Considering that the proposed IFC loan will be the first tier 2 capital instruments in the sector, the project is expected to introduce a new funding class to the market that can be replicated by other Tunisian banks with capital adequacy constraints. 

Impact on the Economy: The successful implementation of BIAT's development strategy will achieve the following results:

-  promote lending in the economy 
-  develop financial intermediation by increasing the depositor base and 
-  underpin the overall growth in the economy, as higher loan volumes will benefit customers, suppliers and new entrants. 

The three key developmental indicators to be monitored will be:

-  the number of loans originated by BIAT; 
-  the increase of its depositor base and 
-  the diffusion of best practices in the financial sector. 

IFC Role: 

This IFC transaction is expected to 

-  help improve the financial fundamentals of the bank by increasing capital adequacy ratios 
-  support BIAT's in its diversification strategy into the consumer lending market and the growth of its loan book, and 
-  lead the way for other financial institutions to access the subordinated debt market by launching a landmark transaction in Tunisia, representing the first Tier 2 instrument in the banking sector","","This is an FI Type 1 project.

BIAT was  established in early 1976 by a group of investors composed of local institutions and individuals, and Arab and European banks, who acquired the domestic branches of the British Bank of the Middle East and Société Marseillaise de Crédit.  In its early years, BIAT expanded rapidly, and in the 1980s it had become the largest private bank in Tunisia. IFC involvement with BIAT goes back to 1998 when it underwrote the first international equity offering in Tunisian in the form a GDR  in which IFC invested (currently holding 1.13%).   BIAT is considered the most sophisticated Tunisian bank. It is the leading customer-deposit collector through product innovation and sophisticated marketing. Historically the Bank had a strong involvement with domestic corporates and SME's which it is now complementing with new developments in the more profitable consumer/personal banking. This developmental strategy should help the bank broaden its large deposit base, diversify its sources of income, reduce its average risk per customer, and report higher profitability. Overall, BIAT enjoys a strong market franchise among its clients as evidenced by a stable market share of about 11% of loans and 15% of deposits over the past four years.","

Comgas,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Brazil,COMPANHIA DE GAS DE SAO PAULO,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2004-03-11T05:00:00Z,2004-04-23T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"Comgas is the largest natural gas distribution company in Brazil, with a network of 3,250 km of pipelines covering 41 municipalities in the State of Sao Paulo, and reaching over 400,000 residential, commercial and industrial consumers.  Comgas' predecessor companies date to 1872, with its present operations beginning with privatization in April 1999.  Comgas was acquired by a consortium consisting primarily of British Gas and Shell Groups.  The company aims to expand the use of natural gas as a cheaper, more environmentally-friendly option than alternative fuels, such as coal, fuel oil or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).  

Comgas operates under a 30-year concession to distribute natural gas  covering  177 municipalities in Sao Paulo state.  Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo.  The concession contract establishes expansion goals for the company, which include achieving 70,000 additional customers and 400 kilometers of new networks within the first 5-year period and a total of 200,000 additional customers within 10 years.  

Comgas is also active in the promotion of natural gas for vehicles (NGVs), which offer savings of up to 70 % over gasoline and emit less pollution.  This commitment includes the operation of nearly 200 NGV filling stations and the conversion of over 100,000 vehicles by the end of 2004.  The company expects to reach 200,000 converted vehicles by 2008.

Comgas obtains its gas supplies from two geographical sources  Bolivia, via the Bolivia-to-Brazil (BTB) transmission pipeline, and offshore Brazil, by the GASAN/GASPAL transmission pipelines from the Santos/Campos Basins.","","","","","","","","","IFC funding will allow Comgás to continue to implement projects with a substantial development impact. A strong factor that encourages industries to start up in or relocate to the São Paulo region is the increasing availability of natural gas. It is expected that São Paulo will continue to attract new industries as the Comgás network is expanded to new industrial areas envisaged under the project. The economies of scale generated by operating in close proximity to the significant market represented by São Paulo's 24 million population are also important. This combination of economies of scale and the availability of gas (at the right price) will be a powerful magnet drawing enterprises to the region.  Also, the expansion of the gas distribution network will increase economic activity due to requirement for domestically manufactured goods, as well as lead to an increased requirement for construction jobs.

IFC support will strengthen Comgás as a company that proactively seeks to promote community development programs, including the Comgás Apprentice program, the Corporate Volunteering, and the Environmental Education and Social Programs. The expansion of the company's operations to new areas under the project is expected to result in the expansion of the Comgás social development programs accordingly. The expansion of the Comgás distribution network also carries important safety benefits. The inherent physical characteristics of natural gas give it a higher ignition point, and a higher required concentration for an explosion, than either gasoline or LPG thereby reducing the risk of a catastrophic accident.

The continuous distribution of natural gas through the pipeline by a safety-conscious company such as Comgás, reduces risks associated with accidents in the transport of LPG cylinders, and eliminates the need for storage facilities. Comgás will also widen access of natural gas to more lower income consumers than at present, that will derive benefit from the avoided cost in terms of time and in the handling and change-out of LPG cylinders and the increased convenience of natural gas. Natural gas is the cleanest burning of all the fossil fuels, and environmental benefits include large reductions of nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and total organic emissions compared to emissions from combustion of fuel oil commonly used in São Paulo. Consequently, environmental benefits and a lower contribution to greenhouse gas generation will result from further development of the gas market by Comgás. In time the substitution of diesel in the heavy vehicle transport sector may also provide significant pollution reduction benefits. Other benefits accrue from the cast iron mains replacement where leakage is reduced (natural gas itself being a greenhouse gas).

Comgás is an exceptional candidate for IFC support as a key player in facilitating the expansion and consolidation of the gas distribution system in the state of São Paulo.  The natural gas distribution industry, due to regulatory controls, is typically characterized by relatively long pay-back periods and moderate financial rates of return, which substantially underestimate its very important economic and environmental benefits.  Appropriate long-term financing is essential for such projects.  Since its inception in 1999, Comgás has been able to partly finance its network expansion through a combination of medium and short-term financing of five years or less in maturity.  

IFC's funding would enable Comgás to continue with its expansion plan with a more stable financing structure.   IFC would also be mobilizing substantial international commercial bank financing which would otherwise not be available.  As such, the company lacks access to the more traditional longer-term debt or capital market financing normally available to larger gas distribution companies under more favorable macroeconomic conditions.","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.Environmental and social review of this project consisted of appraising information submitted by the project sponsor and a report prepared by a technical consultant to IFC.  This review addressed the compliance status of Comgas'' current operations, including right-of-way alignment and land acquisition, and how liabilities such as land contamination and labor obligations associated with pre-privatization operations are managed.

Kusadasi Cruise Ship Terminal,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,Türkiye,Ege Liman Isletmeleri A.S.,Regional Industry INF MCT,2004-03-18T05:00:00Z,2004-04-30T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"Ege Liman Isletmeleri A.S, (Ege Ports) is a special purpose Turkish company specifically incorporated to operate a cruise ship terminal in Kusadasi (the Kusadasi Port) under a 30-year concession granted by the Government of Turkey (GOT) in July 2003 following a competitive bidding process.  Kusadasi Port is the largest cruise ship terminal in Turkey and is a popular port of call on cruises that originate in Greece, Italy, France, Spain and Turkey.  Ege Ports offers the following basic services to ships calling at the port:  
-  tugging, 
-  pilotage, 
-  sheltering, 
-  clean water supply, 
-  disposal of solid waste, 
-  underwater diving inspection, and 
-  fuel supply.

The proposed project comprises the operation and expansion of the Kusadasi Port, including the financing of the $24.3 million concession payment to the GOT;  construction of a new passenger terminal;  extension of the existing berths and purchase of equipment necessary for carrying out operations of the Kusadasi Port.  The proposed project will bring Kusadasi Port operations into compliance with the International Port and Facility Security (ISPS) Code.","","","","","","","","","The development impact of the project would be substantial.  The major revenue earner in Kusadasi is tourism and the main asset in this regard is the Kusadasi Port.  The privatization of Kusadasi Port will ensure, through more efficient operation; enhanced security; and a focused marketing program internationally, long-term economic growth of various local small businesses in Kusadasi which depend on the cruise ship traffic.  In addition, efficient and effective management of the Port will attract additional cruise lines to make Kusadasi their port of choice.  The revenue generated by tourism in the region is essential for the ongoing maintenance and development of the areas' historic sites.  The main tourism destination for passengers from the cruise ships arriving at the Port of Kusadasi is Ephesus and the surrounding area.  Hence, the links between the successful operation of the Port and the development of Kusadasi and the Ephesus area are very strong.  Furthermore, the proposed project would ensure that the port is operated in an environmentally sound manner.

IFC's investment in the proposed project would provide long-term financing necessary for a concession-based project at a reasonable cost.  In this context, IFC will also help catalyze long-term financing from a financial institution(s) through the B loan.  Long-term limited recourse financing is practically nonexistent in Turkey from either domestic or foreign sources.  This was evidenced by the cancellation of the first concession granting process due to the winning bidder's inability to raise financing.  In order for the GOT's privatization program to be successful, private sector companies need to be able to raise long-term financing.  The proposed project is the first major cruise ship port privatization in Turkey and its successful financing would also have a strong demonstration effect on potential investors in other privatizations of other ports in Turkey.","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental, social and cultural impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

Specifically, IFCs Corporate Citizenship Facility (CCF) is coordinating with the FSM in the development of a program to establish community-managed nurseries to supply the mine''s reforestation needs. CCF would supply funding for a consultant to provide TA to the communities in getting the nurseries up and running and possibly provide marketing assistance.  In addition, as part of project supervision, IFC would assist FSM with monitoring and evaluation of its various programs.   This program would lay the groundwork for further IFC involvement including IFC SME assistance. The objective would be to not only create supplier linkages but also opportunities beyond the mine, thereby creating employment in the mine communities that should outlast eventual closure. -  Local Hiring and Skills Transfer: Montana intends to train and hire as many local residents of surrounding communities as practical.  Montanas local hiring target is 80% of the operations workforce.  -  Local Capacity Building and Infrastructure Improvements:  Through FSM, Montana will assist local governments and appropriate non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the development and improvement of community facilities and services, such as health care, schools, utilities and municipal management.  -  Demonstration Impact:  Marlin will be one of the first mining investments in Guatemala in years.

Through this financing IFC will assist the bank in expanding its mortgage lending operations and reaching its growth objectives by using the best practice underwriting policies and procedures.  The project will also encourage competition among the local banks engaged in mortgage lending and increase clients access to longer term financing, making the home ownership more affordable.   Housing finance is a relatively new, but a fast growing banking sector in Romania, whose potential is limited by the availability of long term bank funding.  Over the last decade, low quality of the existing housing stock, general housing deficit, and low housing affordability translated into a high demand for mortgage products.  With the recent appearance of longer tenor financing, this pent-up demand led to a steep increase in mortgage lending in Romania.  Starting from a low $100 million sector wide mortgage portfolio in the end 2002 it is expected to surpass $1 billion by 2005.    The bank started extended housing loans in 2002 and continued with mortgage loans in 2003.  BT has been an active participant in the mortgage lending, holding about 12% market share and having about half of its mortgage portfolio in the Transilvania region.  The banks objective is to double the size of its mortgage portfolio by the end of 2004 and to this end BT requires more term funds.  With the term of up to 10 years, the IFCs financing package would allow Banca Transilvania to increase the tenors of its mortgage offering for up to 15 years.","","","","","","","","","The housing finance market in Romania is still in its infancy though the demand for mortgage products is very strong.  An important developmental impact of this project is to provide critically needed long-term funding to support the extension of long term mortgage loans to families that wish to purchase or renovate their homes.  The tenor of IFCs loan would enable BT to provide long-term, and thus, more affordable mortgages.  With increased affordability, more individuals could access funding to purchase new or renovate existing homes.  Furthermore, through linkage effects, the development of the housing industry stimulates the supply of labor and materials for the construction and improvement of homes, a significant contributor to economic growth in Romania.  IFC will play a major role in ensuring that the banks mortgage products are structured using the best practice underwriting and mortgage servicing standards, including the transparency of mortgage information disclosure to the banks borrowers.  Through its long term financing IFC will assist in diversifying the funding base and extending the funding tenor of a dynamic regional bank, which is active in the underrepresented regional housing segment of the Romanian banking sector.

The project entails the expansion of  the mine from the existing 1million tonnes of bauxite per annum to produce up to 6 million tones per annum and to start early works on the construction of an associated alumina refinery. This is the initial phase of the larger integrated project that includes the bauxite mine, an alumina refinery and an aluminium smelter and which will be one of the largest new investment projects in Russia.","","","","","","","","","This project represents Phase I of one of the largest greenfield projects in Russia to date. The project should have a major development impact on the Komi Republic which to date has had a limited industrial base. The overall size of the integrated project is expected to be in excess of $2 billion. IFC involvement will help secure longer term financing for the project than is currently available and will establish the project on the international financial markets, thereby allowing the SUAL Group to secure further financing for Phase II (refinery construction) and Phase III (smelter construction). IFCs extensive technical experience of the aluminium sector is being used to enhance the technical assessment and design of the mine and refinery.IFC is proposing a large donor funded effort to stimulate local supply chains to the project and improve the climate for SMEs in the Komi Republic. This initiative also envisages the establishment of a financing facility for local SMEs. IFC involvement will also help ensure that best practice is employed in minimizing environmental and social impacts.","","The Phase I project is a category A project as it is considered a key component of the future Integrated Project. There are no major environmental, health and safety risks associated with this expansion project as mining bauxite does not require the use of chemicals or of a process flow generating emissions or effluents. Starting in about 6-8 years the dewatering of certain pits will require caution, and proper mitigation measures and a management plan will be in place by that time. The Phase I project is not anticipated to result in major social and cultural property impacts, as it is an existing site located in a remote and unpopulated area. SUAL Group has agreed to carry out a detailed environmental, social, health and safety assessment of the mines. The due diligence of the mining project was undertaken in two separate phases. The first one, phase 1a, consisted of an environmental and social audit of the current mine (1 to 2.5 mtpa capacity), a detailed review of the SUAL Groups environmental and social management and the initiation of the public consultation and disclosure (PCD) process. Phase 1b includes an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment for the expansion to 6 mtpa, a detailed environmental and social action plan (ESAP), a formal PCD strategy supported by key stakeholders and the necessary environmental documents for initiating permits and early civil works at the refinery site. Strong emphasis was especially put on public consultation, land acquisition, mine decommissioning, water resource management, and local economic development activities (supplier and other SME development, training, etc). As a result of IFC involvement the SUAL Group has hired key environmental and social executives and implemented the first steps of an Environmental Management System (EMS).Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityA dedicated web site is being maintained by the SUAL Group, including all the public documents in downloadable format in both the English and Russian languages.

Chenming LWC,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,East Asia and the Pacific,China,"Jiangxi Chenming Paper Co.,Ltd.",Regional Industry - MAS Asia & Pac,2004-03-30T05:00:00Z,2004-06-03T04:00:00Z,A,Loan,"The project is a $487 million investment in Jiangxi Chenming a greenfield paper facility in the Changbei economic development zone, Nanchang city, China. The facility will produce 350,000 tpy of light weight coated (LWC) paper and will be built and operated by Shandong Chenming Paper Holdings (Chenming or the sponsor), the largest Chinese-owned paper company, and Shinmoorim Paper MFG Company (Shinmoorim), South Koreas second largest coated paper producer and IFC client.  The project will be implemented over an 18 month period and consist of: -  installation and operation of an LWC paper machine with an annual capacity of 350,000 metric tons per annum (tpy); -  a Bleached Thermo Mechanical Pulp (BTMP) plant with an annual capacity of 187,000 tpy; -  a De-Inked Pulp (DIP) plant with an annual capacity of 136,000 tpy; -  a co-generation power plant with a total capacity of 100 megawatts; and -  ancillary infrastructure, including wastewater treatment and port installations.This purpose of this project is to support Chenmings strategy of becoming a major international paper company within the next five years and it will also facilitate Shinmoorims expansion in China.  In so doing, it will bridge a market gap in the availability of LWC paper in the Asia-Pacific region, which is a limited producer and net importer of coated paper.  Given that market trends indicate an increasing demand for LWC paper, local Chinese production of this light-weight paper will reduce costs for end-users, especially those in advertising and print media.","","","","","","","","","IFC will play a major role in the supporting the project by-  working closely with Chenming to educate the sponsor about international financing options, corporate governance, and financial risk management.  IFC has helped Chenming identify key risks such as aged receivables and excessive reliance on short-term debt, and will work will the client to optimize its capital structure, -  acting as a honest broker between Chenming and Shinmoorim, its technical partner and the projects other international investor and -  ensuring transparency and strong corporate governance at the level of the project company by taking an equity stake.  IFCs advice will also enhance Chenmings efforts to attain world-class operations, management and governance at the project company.  IFCs role also includes introducing Chenming to international financiers through the B Loan / parallel financing initiative, as well as providing advice related to sustainability practices, particularly with respect to the companys plantation effort and environmental management policies.  In essence, IFC will play a critical role in taking Chenming from the largest Chinese paper company to a leading and ranked player in the worldwide pulp and paper industry.  The development impact of this project will help construct a world-class LWC plant to meet the rapidly growing demand for lightweight coated paper in China.  Chenming has a competitive advantage over imports due to lower transport, co-generation power, and labor costs.  These advantages more than offset the higher fiber in the Chinese market.  In addition, The projects large scale and high quality technical know-how will advantage it over other local suppliers.  In addition, the project will have the following benefits:  -  Regional Development: The project will result in a large-scale investment in Chinas paper sector thereby resulting in increased output, productivity, employment and associated rise in income.  This is especially relevant in rural areas such as Jiangxi, where there are relatively few employment options for the local population.  In addition, the presence of project facility will help develop the local area around the industrial park, creating retail and other business opportunities for the surrounding community.-  Technology Transfer:  The project will receive equipment and technical advice from Metso (Finland) and Andritz (Austria), which will greatly enhance the technical know-how of the company, which will help improve standards across the local paper industry.-  Environment: The project will greatly enhance Chenmings environmental management system and controls beyond local requirements to achieve standardization among the Group companies and international best practices.  All environmental, health, safety and quality activities will be implemented through integrated management systems at all plants to ensure that the environmental conditions are maintained and that the safety and health of the employees is protected, ultimately resulting in cost savings and improved employee morale;-  Corporate Governance:  IFCs guidance vis-à-vis corporate governance, especially as it relates to Chenmings financial risk management policies, will be extremely valuable to the sponsor.  At present, Chenming does not adhere to the stringent financial risk mitigation policies put in place by many of the top P&P producers in the world.  By supporting the project, IFC will be able to guide the sponsor on corporate governance policies that will allow it compete effectively internationally, implement standards prevalent among global P&P companies, and obtain long term financing from international investors.","","This project was defined as an environmental and social Category A project because following project pre-appraisal significant, adverse and sensitive environmental and social impacts were anticipated.  These impacts result from resettlement associated with development of the greenfield site and emissions to air from the boiler plant required to service the 100 MWe power station.

Upon completion of the acquisition, China Greens portfolio will include the following:  -  Jiaxing Jinjiang Cogeneration Co. Ltd. -- a 50 MW CHP plant (currently being expanded by 12 MW); -  Yuhang Jinjiang Environmental Energy Ltd. -- a 12 MW waste to energy (WTE) plant utilizing MSW as primary fuel; -  Jiande Jinjiang Comprehensive Utilization Ltd.  a 12 MW plant that utilizes bone coal as primary fuel; -  Zhengzhou Xinjin Green Environmental Energy Ltd.  a 24 MW WTE plant (currently being expanded by 12 MW) utilizing MSW as fuel;  -  Henan Dengfeng Xinjin Comprehensive Utilization Ltd.  a 24 MW plant utilizing low grade coal as fuel; and -  Yima Jinjiang Comprehensive Utilization Ltd.  a 270 MW plant currently under construction and will utilize low grade coal as fuel.IFCs investment involves an IFC A loan of up to $20 million to China Green, with detachable warrants that give IFC the right to subscribe up to $10 million of the Companys common equity.   IFCs loan will assist the company in completing the acquisition of HZJJs interests in power generation assets in China.  IFCs investment will also assist the company in improving its corporate governance policies and preparing it for an IPO in an international stock market.","","","","","","","","","China suffers from severe pollution problems caused by huge numbers of small, inefficient, coal-fired heating boilers that supply steam to residential, commercial, and small industries.  China also suffers from solid waste pollution problems caused by fast paced urbanization on one hand, and the lack of planning, resources and technology to efficiently handle the increasing amount of MSW on the other.  The projects to be owned and developed by China Green are addressing these concerns in efficient ways such as; the company''s use of specialized boiler technology and emissions controls reduces pollution linked to the handling of MSW, current practices for burning of low grade coal, and the stockpiling of waste coal at mines and processing sites. These well-run larger plants enable the shutdown of many of the small boilers.  The success of China Green will demonstrate that environmentally compliant, well-managed power projects can be financially viable in the PRC market, and set a benchmark for other operators.  This project would be the first IFC investment to a leading domestic group in the Chinese power sector, and it will be a concrete example of IFCs support to the government policy reform to encourage more private sector participation in power and other infrastructure areas.  In addition, as an important part of IFCs investment, IFC will take an active role in helping the company improve its corporate governance policies and bring international best practice to the company.  IFCs presence is also important to provide comfort to other international investors and thus help the company access the international capital market.  IFCs involvement will also ensure that existing plants, owned by China Green, are environmentally upgraded to the practical extent, and that new facilities will be constructed to meet World Bank Group guidelines.","","IFC will effectively invest at the corporate level in a power development company, with the investment linked to specific projects.

Trade & Development Bank of Mongolia,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,East Asia and the Pacific,Mongolia,TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT BANK OF MONGOLIA LLC,"Global Industry, Financial Markets",2004-04-27T04:00:00Z,2004-05-27T04:00:00Z,FI-1,Loan,"Trade & Development Bank of Mongolia (TDB or the bank) was established in October 1990 by Government resolution under the name of State Bank of Mongolia (International), and started operations on January 1991 with the main purpose of managing the foreign trade and commercial activities of the Government of Mongolia. In October 1993, the bank changed its denomination to TDB. 

In April 1998, the Government of Mongolia sold 24% of its shares to employees while retaining the remaining 76% and, in December 2002, as part of the 2001-2004 privatization strategy, TDB was totally privatized.

IFC is considering an investment of up to the equivalent of $1.5 million representing an up to 10% equity stake. In addition to the equity investment, IFC is also considering a US$ denominated subordinated loan of up to $3.5 million, with a tenor of 7 years.","","","","","","","","","-  Development Impact:

Since TDB's privatization in December 2002 both Consortium and ING representatives have commented favorably on the constructive role which IFC and ADB representatives and consultants have played. Given TDB's prominent position in Mongolia's fragile economy, there can be little doubt of the important developmental role that a future IFC investment would fulfill.

-  Catalytic and demonstration effect: 

IFC's investment will demonstrate to the general public that privatization has produced clear and tangible positive results for Mongolia. IFC's support for the current Government of Mongolia privatization policy demonstrates that it is fair and in the country's best interest. 

In time, and with the support of IFC, TDB expects to act as a catalyst for the development of a legal framework for new financial products such as mortgage lending, leasing, factoring and general and life insurance  basic financial service activities which are currently at inception or weak to the point where they impinge upon the country's ability for further development.

-  Financial reforms and FDI attraction: 

Mongolia has seen only limited foreign direct investment to date. IFC's investment in TDB following its successful privatization will raise awareness within the international community as to Mongolia's financial stability. It will create an environment in which foreign investors will feel less exposed and will be a sign to foreign corporations that IFC is sufficiently confident in Mongolia's banking sector and future investors will feel less exposed.

-  Promotion of competitiveness in banking sector: 

This investment is designed to strengthen Mongolia's commercial banking sector. Although TDB's ING-seconded management has been given full authority by the Consortium to manage the bank without intrusion, both the Consortium and the ING management is keen for IFC to play a leading role in terms of the development and implementation of best practices in Mongolia's largest bank which, in turn, will set higher standards for the entire sector as well.

Advancement of best practices and corporate governance: 

IFC will be teamed with financial partners of international standing to promote quality services such as ensuring borrowers' compliance with good corporate governance requirements, hedging currency and metals price risk, ability for co-financing and loan syndication, handling of trade related requirements in the framework of specific projects. Introduction of new financing techniques will be cost effective for borrowers and will result in trade promotion. This proposed investment represents a clear signal that IFC has confidence in TDB's management, strategy, and potential.

IFC Role:

Mongolia's financial sector remains in its nascent stages. The sector requires support from the international financial institutions to develop all its aspects in accordance with international best practices, including retail and corporate lending, mortgage finance, leasing, and insurance.

IFC's investment in TDB will help to ensure the future sustainability of Mongolia's largest and longest standing financial institution and will have a significant developmental impact. As a minority shareholder, IFC would have access to valuable market intelligence and that would prove to be an excellent source of information as to the major issues facing business in Mongolia, including banking regulations, tax and bankruptcy laws. The lessons learned from this investment should result in other investment opportunities that contribute to the sustained growth of Mongolia's financial sector.","","This is an FI Type 1 project. TDB will be required to develop an environmental management system. TDB must require that investments under relevant operations meet host country environmental, health and safety requirements.Location of environmental documents in locally affected community","TDB shareholding structure is currently the following: Globull Investment & Development Management S.A. ('Globull') with 76.0%, Mongol Postal Bank with 13.9% (2.9% direct and 11.0% indirect participation) and other minority shareholders with 10.1%.

Globull was established by Ernst & Young at the request of the consortium consisting of Gerald UK (a wholly owned subsidiary of GMI) and BCL in Luxemburg in December 2002, with registered head-office in Luxembourg.

GMI, the leading partner in the Consortium, has over 30 years of trading and merchant banking experience in Asia, including a 20-year physical presence in the region, and its interest in TDB stemmed from its historical links to the Mongolian copper and gold trade. On its turn BCL may participate in some of the GMI initiated Mongolian-sourced merchant banking transactions and, at some future time, transfer their asset management expertise to TDB.

This is especially relevant in poor / underprivileged areas south of Cali, which is in the conflict area and which otherwise offers few employment options; -  Regional Focus: Carvajal is embarking on a program that will result in investments in most Latin American countries, including those which have limited access to capital markets (such as Central America), and those in which private sector investments have decreased substantially, such as Brazil; -  High-quality products / services: the focus on reducing operating costs as well as improving employee training and product quality will result in competitively priced, high-quality products for consumers in the region.  In addition, in becoming a more important player in the publishing/editing business, the company is expected to develop into the preferred venue for Spanish-speaking writers or overseas publishing houses wishing to find distribution channels throughout Latin America.  Moreover, increasing the supply of written material in Latin America at more affordable prices is expected to have a positive impact in the populations reading index throughout the region; -  Competitiveness: the investment will make Carvajal more internationally competitive, thereby allowing Colombia and other Latin America countries to increase sales to export markets and improve technical know-how; -  Environment:  the Project will raise the companys environmental and safety standards, often times also resulting in cost savings and improved employee morale, and -  Community development: the success and profitability of Carvajal will help to extend the operations of the Carvajal, Hernando Carvajal B, and Propal Foundations in the communities in Aguablanca and Caloto. IFCs involvement with the company will signal a strong vote of confidence for the Colombian private sector.  Given Colombias loss of its investment grade rating in 1999, recent economic recession, political uncertainty and liquidity constraints in the domestic banking sector, consistent access to long-term investment capital (especially from foreign sources) has decreased even for the blue chip companies.  IFCs investment in the company will provide long-term financing for an independent, professionally-managed Colombian conglomerate and show support for the countrys private enterprises.  In addition, IFCs investment is expected to allow the company to accelerate its investment program, notably with respect to acquisitions.  IFCs involvement and advice is also expected to positively impact the Companys environmental, corporate governance and financial reporting standards with the goal of bringing them in line with international best-practice standards.  The project would also extend support to cross-border market operations in Latin America, including those in poorer Andean and Caribbean countries where Carvajal operates.","","The project is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental impacts may result or which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

The loan would have a final maturity of seven years and will be used by the bank for on lending to private Moldovan enterprises, including those operating in the housing sector.

Over the last couple of years the recovery of Moldovan economy has led to the rising demand for housing.  Generally the country is faced with the low quality of the existing housing stock, increased housing deficit, and a low housing affordability.  Recently this situation translated into a lot of construction starts and rising real estate prices due to the increased purchasing power of the population and unmet demand for quality dwelling.  Concurrently, Victoriabank began lending to real estate developers and extending housing  loans to individuals. The bank is planning to continue developing this business line.  However, the local banking sector is still facing difficulties in accessing long term funding.  By extending a seven-year loan to VB, IFC could provide Moldovan companies and individuals with much needed financing of longer tenor.

(TRG or the company) was awarded a 25-year lease through a public tender in 1997 to expand and operate the container terminal (the Terminal) in the port of Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.  The Terminal was the second Brazilian container facility to be privatized and is currently the second largest container terminal in Brazil, accounting for approximately 12% of the country''s total container movement.  The proposed project is the expansion of the Terminal, and comprises civil works associated with building a third berth of 250 meters and improvements in the container stacking area, together with purchase of additional equipment, including two additional Post-Panamax gantry cranes, three rubber tired gantry cranes and seven trucks.  The expansion will increase the annual capacity of the Terminal from 300,000 container-moves to about 525,000 container-moves, easing capacity constraints and allowing TRG to capture unmet demand for the Terminals services.This project would be the second one to be financed by IFC.  In December 1998, IFC financing (a $31 million loan comprising an A-Loan of $7.5 million, a B-loan of $18 million and a C-Loan of $5.5 million) supported the purchase of four cranes, a 300-meter extension of an existing quay, and repair and upgrading of various facilities.","","","","","","","","","TRG has had, and will continue to have, a significant development impact with notable private sector development and substantial benefits accruing to its stakeholders.  The project is expected to continue raising the overall efficiency of transportation infrastructure in southern Brazil, reduce transport costs for exporters in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, provide increased employment in the town of Rio Grande, and generate increasing amounts of foreign exchange, tax and other revenues for federal, state and local government including the Port Authority of Rio Grande (SUPRG).  Since 1997, TRG has provided its customers better service and the ability to move more containers through the terminal while simultaneously lowering tariffs; it has also made a substantial contribution to the regional and state economy by generating employment, taxes and royalties and by providing financial support to a number of social projects and activities in the community.  TRG has also devoted significant effort in building and maintaining a productive and amicable relationship with the stevedores union, which views this relationship as best practice.  In the seven years since inception, TRG has increased its own employment by ten-fold and increased its use of non-employee contract labor (stevedores and tallyclerks) by three-fold.  Looking forward, the proposed project will enable TRG to build upon its existing strengths and continue to generate significant development impact for its customers, employees and the community.IFCs investment in the proposed project would provide TRG necessary long-term financing, thereby assisting a local, medium-size company in expanding a highly successful operation that will further enhance transportation infrastructure in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, strengthen the competitiveness of exports from the region, generate significant economic and social benefits for the region and provide additional foreign exchange revenues for Brazil.

Business Partners International (Proprietary) Limited,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Africa,Africa Region,BUSINESS PARTNERS INTERNATIONAL (PTY) LTD,Regional Industry - FIG Africa,2004-05-17T04:00:00Z,2004-06-17T04:00:00Z,FI,Equity,"The proposed project is to establish a fund management operation, Business Partners International (BPI or the company), as the basis for expanding the Business Partners SME financing model to other Sub-Saharan African countries.  The project is designed to support IFC's strategy to develop financing vehicles capable of providing funding and technical support to SMEs on commercial terms and in a sustainable manner.  

Although the SME sector is the engine of economic development in most countries, funding SMEs in the developing world has suffered from three main obstacles:  

-  because of the absence or under-development of real property rights or ownership in many developing countries, it is difficult for borrowers to provide collateral against loans and even more difficult for banks to enforce claims over the collateral;  
-  since most SMEs are lifestyle businesses and small in scale, there is limited upside potential for the equity investor; and 
-  the small size of SMEs means that the costs associated with identifying, processing and monitoring an investment are very high relative to the size of the investment, making most SMEs unattractive for investors.

The project will overcome these obstacles by using quasi-equity instruments that do not necessarily require full collateralization and by using efficient processing and monitoring systems that will improve cost efficiencies.  The project is also designed to support IFC's development of the SME Solutions Center (SSC) network across Africa.  BPI fund management companies in Africa will be co-located within the SSCs to maximize synergies in developing deal flow and providing technical assistance services.
It is expected that initially BPI will establish 3 pilot-phase single-country funds in each of Madagascar (8.5 million or equivalent of $10.0 million), Kenya ($15 million) and a third country in Sub-Saharan Africa to be determined ($10 million) to provide local currency financing for SMEs and to manage a technical assistance facility that will provide technical support and advice to investee companies in each country.","","","","","","","","","
-  Development Impact

The project is expected to have a powerful developmental impact by overcoming the difficulties associated with funding the SME sector discussed above.  This project will address these obstacles and develop a model for investing in SMEs by:

-  structuring and pricing investments as self-liquidating instruments that will not necessarily require collateral;
-  obtaining cashflow rights that maximize the alignment of interests;
-  using low cost and efficient processes to assess, structure and monitor investments; and
-  providing coordinated and highly focused technical assistance that must demonstrate an acceptable financial return and a solid commercial basis.

-  IFC Role

IFC will play an important role in funding the establishment of BPI and also as an anchor investor in each of the three funds.

-  Fit with World Bank Strategy

Since its inception in 1981, Business Partners has developed an effective process for evaluating, structuring and monitoring investments in SMEs.  The process minimizes the cost of processing small investments with little upside potential and aligns the interest of investment staff to maximize value from the investments.  The process also provides critical support and mentoring to the investees and, importantly, could be easily adapted to incorporate a formal technical assistance program.

Although banks typically dominate lending to SMEs in South Africa, Business Partners services an important niche by providing quasi-equity and unsecured lending, an expertise that would be critical in financing SMEs elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Remgro Ltd, controlled by the Rupert family who founded Business Partners, holds 16% of Business Partners.  Khula Enterprise Finance Ltd, a government owned entity, holds 20%.  The remaining shareholders are mainly large South African mining companies and financial institutions keen to support the development of access to finance for SMEs.","The actual project costs are difficult to establish in advance, given the nature of the project as a start-up and as the first of its kind in each country.

The project's main objective is to address the scarcity of term finance in Nigeria, which has forced Nigerian commercial banks to rely on their capital, or take the maturity risk in order to finance longer-term projects. The lack of term funding results in unsustainable levels of maturity mismatches in the banking system, lost opportunities for financial sector development and lower national economic growth.  Despite a recent improvement in political stability and a commitment to market-oriented economic reform, Nigeria has yet to attract a level of foreign investment in line with the size of its economy. This is creating a critical constraint in the country's development goals, particularly as significant investments are needed to upgrade private sector productive capacity and operations to sustainable levels, and finance the privatization of major industries which the government has planned.

The principal source of feedstock for this plant will be collected in and shipped from appliance, electronics, and office equipment recycling facilities in Japan.  The company has requested the Environmental Opportunities Facility (EOF) of IFC to provide an equity investment of $1.2 million in the company.   The proposed investment would support MBA's planned expansion into markets where costs of virgin materials are relatively high and materials 'take-back mechanisms' have been mandated in producer countries.  MBA estimates that its proprietary recovery and refining process, producing high-quality recovered materials, is a minimum of two years ahead of any competing process.
MBA is providing a high-quality, market-driven product which addresses the environmental issue of  ETP disposal.  In those countries where take-back mechanisms have been legislated, ETP is usually burned in municipal waste incinerators or landfilled.  A very small percentage is currently recovered/recycled despite its high value  exceeding that of other recovered waste materials, including aluminum and PET bottles.

The Group is engaged in the development, production and sale of cosmetic packaging components and offers a fully integrated supply chain. 

The expansion program comprises of the following components: 

-  improving the current technology, facility and working environment of anodizing process and production; 
-  increasing the capacity of the existing operations; and 
-  the development and manufacture of mascara and pump-based line of products.

Successful implementation of the project will allow the Group to become better integrated into the global cosmetic and toiletry supply chain and increase its market share in this growing sector.","","","","","","","","","The project is expected to have a significant development impact as follows:

It will help Fangxin become a larger and more efficient packager of C&T products.  The success of Fangxin will rely on the industry experience, market access and good track record of its founder and the additional capital and operational and  debt restructuring provided by this Project. Fangxin is the top quality producer in China and with the new capital should serve as a benchmark in the industry in China.  The country will gain from the development of this industry as the major C&T companies turn increasingly to lower cost countries for packaging their products.  

IFC's role in the proposed project could be valuable for on the following grounds:

- Transfer of International Best Practices:
Through the technical assistance initiative, IFC is helping the Group evolve from a family-owned business to a leading manufacturer in China with improved financial and strategic management and corporate governance practices, thereby enhancing its access to international financial markets and setting the stage for a future IPO. 

- Provide flexible corporate financing:
As a young company, it has limited access to long-term funding from local banks for the proposed expansion.  IFC will provide the required long term money to Fangxin that will allow it to acquire the scale its operation needs. Moreover, IFC's involvement has helped attract additional financing from DEG and encouraged Fangxin's existing local banks to provide longer tenors to the Group.

- Supporting the development of a competitive local manufacturer:
Fangxin has expressed the desire to work with international experts that provide both financial and strategic advice that will help the Group to grow from an emerging, family-run business to a global player with requisite skills to exploit its competitive advantages.  In addition, IFC also provides the stamp of approval that global players like Maybelline, L'Oreal, Revlon are looking for when making critical outsourcing decisions.

- Corporate Governance:
IFC, through its proposed investment, will help to instill corporate governance that are necessary for Fangxin to evolve from a family business to a professionally managed company with appropriate organizational structure, internal processes and functions. This would also prepare Fangxin for its future IPO.","","This is a category B project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP),Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Pending Approval,World,World Region,Global Trade Finance Program,Global Trade & Supply Chain,2004-10-13T04:00:00Z,2004-11-11T05:00:00Z,C,Guarantee,"
The project is to establish the Global Trade Finance Program or 'GTFP', a $500 million trade program, that will provide IFC with a flexible platform from which to support the extension of trade finance to under-served clients globally. The objective is for the Corporation to be in position to quickly supplement liquidity where and when it is needed in the system, assist local banks in every region in developing credit relationships with international commercial banks and to arrange training and technical assistance wherever most needed to improve their trade finance capabilities.  

The program will respond to on-going demand from clients for the Corporation to support trade-related business, both during normal market conditions as well as during periods of liquidity constraints. The inherent flexibility of the proposed framework will permit IFC to respond globally to shifting market and client needs without implementation delays or extra cost. The GTFP will be built up gradually to ensure diversification of the portfolio. Full utilization is anticipated in the fourth year of operations, however, since this is a new program, the rate of growth could be faster or slower.

The program will add significant value to local banks, importers and exporters by creating a comprehensive global network of trade finance providers that can be mobilized to extend efficient, responsive, client-driven service.  Trade between countries with a limited bi-lateral trade history can be difficult since financial institutions are risk-averse when there is no track record of successful transactions.  Hence easy access to a large global network of banks is fundamental to the success of trade finance. Through the GTFP, the Corporation will enhance trade finance capacity in local banks, both by facilitating trade credit as well as through technical assistance.  The training of local staff in the practice of trade finance is an important component of this program. In most markets, this will have the greatest net effect on SMEs which are most reliant on the support of local banks as foreign banks typically focus on the larger transactions and top-tier commercial entities.  The GTFP will guarantee amounts as low as $10,000 to ensure the SME sector is well supported.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a category C project according to IFCs environmental policies.

Novatek Gas,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,Russian Federation,"A ZAO NOVOTEKH-R, FIL",Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2004-10-15T04:00:00Z,2004-11-26T05:00:00Z,B,Loan,"Independent Russian gas producer OAO Novatek (the sponsor) has requested IFC assistance in the staged expansion of a large natural gas and condensate field in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Region of Russias Arctic Circle.  The Yurkharov Gas Field is operated by OOO Yurkharovneftegaz (YNG or the company), a wholly owned subsidiary of OAO Novatek.  Discovered in 1970 by a Gazprom-affiliated exploration company of the Soviet era, the field was deemed too small for Gazproms development threshold.  OOO Yurkharovneftegas was formed in July 1998, and YNGs existing ownership structure was put in place in October 1999.  Production at YNG commenced in January 2003 with 3.115 bcm of gas produced that year.  Gas production is expected to reach 9 bcm/y by the end of 2006. YNG operates the Yurkharovskoe field (approximately 200 sq. km.), which has 208 billion cubic meters (bcm) (7.4 trillion cubic feet (tcf)) of gas and  106 million barrels (mmbbls) of condensate.  The IFC-funded project is to increase YNGs production of gas to 9 bcm/y (Phase I). Two subsequent phases will increase production to 18 bcm/y and to 27 bcm/y.  The companys production will be transported through the regions extensive gas and liquids infrastructure to industrial consumers and gas traders in the domestic market.","","","","","","","","","The CAS for Russia (#24127-RU, May 14, 2002) emphasizes the importance of improving the business environment and enhancing competition, including encouraging reform in the energy sector and increasing effective financial intermediation and opportunities for entry and growth of new firms.  Investment in the natural gas sector is a key part of IFCs oil and gas strategy.  IFCs involvement would stimulate the competition in the natural gas sector, currently dominated by Gazprom, and support a relatively small, local company (Russias natural resource sector is dominated by large companies).  With a recent consolidation in the oil sector and formation of world-scale companies, it is even more important to support the development of smaller, local players who are willing to develop natural gas fields that large companies are not.  IFC will play a role in: -  supporting the development of a locally-owned and operated company, which provides employment in the region, -  providing long-term financing to the company, otherwise unavailable to it, -  advising Novatek on corporate governance issues, and -  helping to streamline Novateks social contributions to the indigenous people in the area of the project.  As this is the first private-sector natural gas financing in Russia, IFCs involvement will have an important demonstrative effect  it will indicate that IFC supports the role of private companies in Russias natural gas sector, and this could encourage other local, private players to participate.  Finally, IFCs investment will increase the supply to the domestic Russian market of a clean, environmentally-friendly source of fuel.IFC plans to monitor the developmental impact of employment, assistance levels to indigenous peoples, and payments made by Novatek to local and federal governments.  -  Environmental and Social BenefitsThe 2002 CAS for Russia also emphasizes the importance of mitigating environmental and social risks, particularly through addressing environmental hazards and improving environmental management; and improving the design, targeting, administrative capacity, and financing of social protection programs.  IFCs involvement in this project supports this pillar of the CAS by bolstering the Companys efforts towards improved environmental and social management.From an environmental perspective, IFC is supporting YNGs efforts to manage operations to international environmental, health, and safety standards.  The Novatek Group is committed to implementing a Corporate Environmental Management System in line with ISO 14001 standards.  Additionally, YNG will complete a Safety and Operability Study of all its operations, workshops, support services, and transport.  An Occupational Health & Safety Management System in line with OHSAS 18001 to ensure ongoing management of worker health and safety is a key element of the operations.-  Benefits to the CommunityIFC has helped the company prepare an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP), which places emphasis on providing assistance to nomadic Nenets, who are normally difficult to support in comparison to more settled Nenets.  As with other oil and gas companies in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Region, YNG has agreements with the local (raion) governments and the local branches of the regional indigenous NGO to provide benefits to the local communities and reindeer breeders.  In cooperation with the Nadym and Tazov region, YNG is committing to programs for university scholarships, assistance to local hospitals and boarding schools, including helicopter time to move the children of reindeer herders to and from the boarding schools, support for the traditional economy and medical care for migrating herders.  Support for the traditional economy will include purchasing fish and reindeer meat for use by staff of the company and finding new markets for traditional products.  The company also assists in the delivery of foodstuffs to herders, who do not have access to shops.  YNG is also providing support for educational and social safety net programs undertaken by the local branches of Yamal for Descendents, the regional non-governmental organization representing the local indigenous peoples.Novatek has committed to publishing annually the amounts paid to local governments, NGOs, and other recipients of funds associated with indigenous peoples.  This information will be distributed to communities within the region by local news outlets and the Yamal for Descendents local branches.On its own, YNG will potentially provide, after further consultation, a service center for reindeer herders migrating through its area.  Additionally, it will be supporting a development plan for Nakhodka, a community next to its license area, and further field research on the migratory herders passing through its production and license areas.  In all, YNG is committing to $5.3 million in expenditures for these programs, including the programs in association with the governments and NGO, over the five years from 2005 to 2010.-  Benefits to the GovernmentThe IFC-financed project will be a source of tax revenues to both the federal (albeit a small portion) and local governments.  According to IFC base case calculations using a production scenario of 9 bcm/y, an average of approximately $40 million per year from the project will accrue to governments in the form of production taxes, excise taxes, profit taxes, export duties and other payments over the life of the project license (until 2020).  About 11% of the tax revenues generated from the project will go to local governments while 89% will go to the federal government.  The Novatek Group publishes taxes paid to the government, including production taxes, excise taxes, property taxes, and others, in its annual audited financial statements.-  Governance ContextThe IMF and the World Bank are both involved in Russia, though to a limited extent given the countrys high foreign exchange reserves.  The 2002 Russia CAS suggests strengthening public sector management by enhancing accountability mechanisms and information flows within and across different levels of government; improving fiscal management at the national and sub-national levels; and improving the efficiency and quality of public service delivery.  In 2003, IMF commended Russia for sound macro-economic policies.  Along with recommendations for continued structural reform, management of oil revenues and in other areas,  IMF also welcomed decisions taken to proceed with new data and fiscal transparency.  In 2004, IMF made a number of recommendations on the operation of the oil stabilization fund set up to manage oil revenues resulting from prices above US$20/bbl.  The stabilization fund has played a role in helping Russia deal with recent windfalls from high oil prices.  In its Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) Fiscal Transparency Module (August 2004), IMF Staff found that Russia had made considerable progress in fiscal transparency and financial management since 1999, although a number of important reforms remain to be undertaken.The revenues contributed from this project to the federal government are relatively small with respect to the total revenues of the Russian government.  In addition, 11% of the taxes from the project go to the local governments, and a portion of these are earmarked for the development of indigenous communities over and beyond what Novatek has already committed to spend.  Given IFCs role and developmental impact and benefits from the project to the community and local government, and given the overall framework of governance in which the project takes place, IFC believes this is a project in which it should invest.","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific social and environmental impacts may result that can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

The Fund will also subsequently introduce a forestry-backed securitized instrument to the Chilean capital markets supported by the net proceeds of the harvest and commercialization of such forestry assets under long-term administrative and off-take agreements with two of Chile's leading forestry companies. 

The Fund's activities will follow the project design of SIF Sociedad Inversora Forestal S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of Fundación Chile that sold a long term bond backed by forest assets in November 2002.  The Fund will pay an annual fee for the land use rights to plant eroded lands and will also share a portion of the net margin of the harvest proceeds with these participating landowners.   The owners of standing forests will receive a negotiated price for the land use rights that terminate after the final harvest of the standing forests.

The two major forestry companies in Chile, Forestal Celco S.A. and Forestal Mininco S.A. (the Forestry Companies), will administer the Fund's forestry assets and acquire the harvested logs under long term administration and off-take contracts. 

The Fund will be created as a Chilean public fund, will be registered in the Santiago's Stock Exchange in Chile and will be regulated by the Chilean Fund Regulator (Superintendencia de Valores y Seguros or SVS).","","","","","","","","","By supporting the Lignum Fund, IFC will be supporting the introduction of a long-term financial mechanism that will help small landowners and farmers increase their income and overcome a number of constraints that are preventing them from effectively managing and optimizing the value of their properties, including: 
-  relatively small holdings; 
-  lack of access to credit; and 
-  unmechanized management and harvesting procedures.   
The project will also have an important environmental impact through the afforestation of eroded land with marginal alternative agricultural use, and will ensure that sustainable forestry management practices are applied to all of the land and forestry assets under its management.

IFC's support and fund structuring expertise will help to mobilize investment from Chilean institutional investors and will also help the Project achieve it's objective of introducing an innovative securitized financial instrument that can be replicated over time, providing Chilean institutional investors an alternative to invest in the forestry sector while also providing a new financing source to Chile's forestry products industry.","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of adverse environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

N.V.) and the Is Bankasi Group, merged with Aycell, the fourth mobile telephony operator, owned by Turk Telecom.  The resulting entity, Avea, is a company with a nation wide GSM network, covering over 80% of the Turkish population, with a market share of about 15% at end of September 2004.  The company had about 4.7 million subscribers as of June 2004 and about 1,000 employees.  The project financing will include the restructuring of Aveas existing debt and the funding of the following:-  working capital requirements and -  the integration, expansion and maintenance of the combined GSM network.  Total project cost is estimated at $2.1 billion, inclusive of approximately $1.1 billion of refinancing of existing debt .","","","","","","","","","Although the Turkish wireless penetration rate has surpassed fixed line penetration, the wireless sector in Turkey has suffered form a lack of effective competition.  The existing cellular providers have, until recently, focused their marketing efforts for the most part on the wealthier demographics for both individual customers and business clients.  The emergence of a strong third operator, which this project seeks to support, should promote greater competition and make cellular communications more affordable and available to larger segments of the population.  In addition, one of Aveas main shareholders, TIM, is an industry leader in cellular innovation.  The project should result in significant technology transfer with respect to increasing use of new value added services for mobile telephony.  Finally, given the strong reservations that investors have towards Turkey due to its history of economic crisis and perceptions of tenuous political stability, a project of this dimension should serve as a way of enhancing investor confidence in foreign direct investment and working with stronger Turkish companies.Significantly weakened market appetite for telecom projects as well as the unavailability of long-term capital in Turkey make critical the strong participation of a multilateral institution such as IFC in a large scale project financing such as this.  Recognizing this, Avea has appointed IFC (together with ABN AMRO) as a joint global coordinator for the financing.  IFC will play a key role in the following aspects:-  providing long term capital; -  attracting international banks under the IFC B Loan program; -  coordinating financing from various sources including local banks and export credit agencies; -  assisting Avea in structuring a complex financing package.","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedure.

The project marks a significant step by FirstRand towards satisfying the BEE requirements of South Africas new Financial Sector Charter.  In addition to the ownership transfer financed under this project, FR will allocate another 3.5% of its shares for the benefit of its black South African staff and non-executive directors.  Together, these share transfers will amount to 10% of FRs outstanding shares.Under the terms of this project, FirstRand will create the FirstRand Empowerment Trust (the trust), an entity which will hold 6.5% of FRs common shares with an approximate value of ZAR4.5 billion (appr. $740 million), and whose beneficiaries are four BEE groups.  FirstRand will capitalize the trust with ZAR1.5 billion (appr. $245 million) by donating an equivalent of 2.1% of FRs shares to be issued.  The required funding of ZAR3.0 billion (appr. $490 million) for the rest of the 4.4% of FRs shares will be raised from senior and subordinated (mezzanine) lenders.  IFC is one of the mezzanine lenders with a proposed participation of $30 million equivalent.  The funded shares will be acquired directly from select shareholders of FirstRand.  Black ownership and control through board representation constitute only one element of FirstRands BEE program.   In accordance with the Financial Sector Charter, which was voluntarily developed by the entire sector, FirstRand is committed to a host of measures to address the social and economic inequalities which hold back South Africa from realizing its full economic potential.   These measures include skills development and training for black professionals and managers, senior appointments, access to financial services,  procurement and sourcing from black owned ventures.  In brief, FirstRand is pursuing a comprehensive transformation program, with specific and measurable targets over the next decade.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category C project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects.

It is listed on the JSE Securities Exchange South Africa (Bloomberg: FSR JJ) and the FirstRand Bank Holdings Ltd., which comprises about 75% of  FRs business, is rated investment grade by Moodys (Baa2), S&P (BBB) and Fitch (BBB).  As of June 30, 2004 FirstRand had about $68 billion in assets, over $33 billion in loans, and close to $4 billion in equity.  The group held about 15% market share of the South African banking sector by asset size.Trust beneficiaries are four BEE groups:-  Kagiso Trust,-  Mineworkers Investment Trust,-  WDB Trust, and-  FirstRand Empowerment Trust.Based on the BEE experience in SA, the groups were selected so as to be broad based rather than represent a small number of black stakeholders, have integrity and good reputation, and share principles and common developmental objectives with FirstRand. The selected BEE groups satisfy the above criteria and represent a broad social development agenda in line with the spirit of the Financial Sector Charter.  Kagiso Trust (KT) was established in 1985 during the struggle against apartheid as a conduit for donor funding from the European Community''s special program for the victims of apartheid.  During the first twelve years of operation, KT became the largest black-led development agency in South Africa.  By the mid 1990s, KT was disbursing funds of approximately R300 million per annum.  For many years the European Community remained the largest funder while the governments of Japan, France, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Swedish International Development Agency contributed sizeable amounts. Since 1986, KT has injected over R 1 billion of grant funds into various development projects in the fields of water and sanitation, training, health, education, small business development and agriculture across the country.Mineworkers Investment Trust (MIT) was founded by the National Union of Mineworkers in July 1995 to make a direct contribution to elevate the economic and social development of mineworkers, ex-mineworkers, construction and energy sector workers and their dependents. Since 1997, MIT has disbursed R62 million to fund its social development projects and program that focus on poverty alleviation, local economic development, enterprise development, job creation and education. WDB Trust was established in 1992 with the purpose of supporting and elevating the economic conditions of poor black women in rural South Africa.  Its specific objectives are to provide poor women with access to finance through not for profit micro-credit, to educate women about developing their own businesses, to enhance their household livelihoods and to improve the position of women in society overall. WDB emphasizes a banking relationship based on mutual trust, credit discipline, collective responsibility, accountability and savings. Since its establishment, WDB has reached over 14 000 women in rural areas with its training and micro-credit programs.  The micro-credit program has disbursed in excess of R25 million through the issuance of over 22 000 micro-loans for income generation activities.   WDB also provides training in mother tongue functional literacy, computer literacy, business development skills and micro-credit delivery.The FirstRand Empowerment Foundation (which may be renamed at a later stage) is an entity which will be created pursuant to the BEE transaction. The FirstRand Empowerment Foundation will be a BEE entity, with the majority of its trustees being black South Africans and its objective will be to economically uplift black South Africans. Its trustees will be drawn from amongst FirstRands non-executive directors, trustees of the BEE trusts, staff members and independent people with appropriate experience. Amongst its initial programs, the FirstRand Empowerment Foundation will focus on the educational and professional development of black South Africans for the industry and to support the growth of a future skills pool to underpin FirstRands transformation initiatives.

Ransa's consolidated USD revenue has grown at an average of 15.2% p.a. from 2000 to 2003, storage volume has increased by 7.8% p.a. for the same period.  To accommodate this growth Ransa has been leasing space from Minka, a sister company operating wholesale and retail space in Lima.  Minka has given notice to Ransa that it will terminate the lease in 2004.

As a result of the lease termination, and to accommodate future growth, Ransa has now decided to embark on a capacity expansion project consisting mainly of the following components:

-  the construction of a 13,500-m² warehouse for general merchandise, 
-  the construction of a 15,000-m² warehouse for distribution, and 
-  the acquisition of a 86,600-m² plot.  

In addition the project includes investments in MIS, other capital expenditures, and debt refinancing.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

The Romero Group is not an incorporated (holding) company but rather represents the Romero Family interests' consolidation.  Only those Companies in which the Family has a controlling position are included in the Group; hence, the financial sector interests' are excluded from the Romero Group (refer to 'The Romero Family Financial Sector Participation' section below for additional information).  To date the Romero Group is composed of the following companies:
-  Alicorp, 
-  Ransa, 
-  Palmas e Industrias del Espino, 
-  Romero Trading, 
-   Industria Textil Piura, 
-  Universal Textil, 
-  Consorcio Naviero Peruano,

Banco de Crédito del Perú (BCP) was the first bank to be established in Peru (founded in 1889) and is now the largest banking institution in the country.  In December 2002, BCP acquired Banco Santander Central Hispano-Perú (BSCH-Perú), whose financials are included in BCP's consolidated financial statements since such date.  BSCH-Perú was merged into BCP on February 28, 2003. 

BCP is 97% owned by Credicorp, a financial holding company incorporated in Bermuda in 1995 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  Credicorp is owned by the Romero family (18.7%) and directors and senior officers of the group (3.2%); with the remaining shares held by other investors.  The Romero family controls Creditcorp with 25% of the voting rights.  Credicorp is now the largest financial services holding company in Peru and is closely identified with its principal subsidiary, BCP.  Credicorp is engaged principally in commercial banking (through BCP and Banco Tequendama in Colombia), insurance (through El Pacífico-Peruano Suiza), and investment banking (through Atlantic Security Holding Corporation).",The total project cost is estimated $20 million.

The project diverts the Tinguiririca River and its major tributary Azufre just upstream of their confluence.  At a gross head of 367 meters and a design flow of 50 m3/s, the installed capacity is 155 MW in two generating units equipped with vertical Francis turbines in a surface powerhouse.  Firm capacity is estimated at 128 MW and average annual energy production at about 840 GWh.  A 38 km long transmission line will be built to connect with Chiles central grid at San Fernando.","","","","","","","","","The project will contribute to the expansion of cost-effective hydroelectric generation capacity to support electricity demand growth in the Central Interconnected System of Chile (SIC).  As the projects water inflows are primarily determined by snow and glacier melting, La Higueras hydrology is not closely correlated with that of the system.  Hence, it is expected La Higuera will be available to dispatch at full load from November through March during the dry season, when the hydrology in the system is below average and the cost of generation tends to be higher (as increasing costly units are dispatched in merit order).       In addition, the project will generate significant direct and indirect employment in the project area.  It is expected that about 500-600 local jobs will be created directly in connection with the construction of the project.  Also, the project will contribute to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as emissions of local pollutants by displacing electricity, particularly during the dry season, that would otherwise have been generated by thermal  plants.IFC, by supporting the project, is therefore playing a key role in ensuring additional power capacity is built in Chile that will help meet the countrys future power demand growth, without being affected by external events such as the recent gas disruption from Argentina to Chile.  In addition, given hydropower projects are generally capital intensive and as a consequence are in need of long-term debt financing, IFC has an important role to play in this transaction in providing 15-year A and C loans and mobilizing a B Loan with up to 13 years in maturity.","","This is an environmental and social review category A project.

It is the first such initiative in the education sector. IFC would provide a partial guarantee of up to 9.5 billion cedis ($1.1 million equivalent) to The Trust Bank (TTB, the Bank, or the company) on loans extended to eligible private schools in the Accra region. These loans will be used to finance construction, purchase of educational materials, and other capital expenditures.  In parallel with the financing facility, a comprehensive technical assistance program is under preparation. The program will be designed to strengthen schools' financial, management, and educational capacities; improve the business environment for private education; and foster the development of an independent provider of educational services to private schools. 

Currently, few local banks are lending to private primary and secondary schools, and those that do, generally lend for less than two years. Thus, even if schools are able to secure bank financing, the tenor of that financing is generally not long enough to support expansion or modernization projects. Such projects thus proceed in a piecemeal fashion, resulting in a great deal of inefficiency and lost potential revenue. Further, expansion by such means cannot keep pace with the huge growth in demand for private schooling. IFC's guarantee would be structured to encourage the Bank to extend maturities to 3-5 years, tenors more appropriate for financing capital investments. 

Despite the impressive growth of private schools in Ghana over the past 15 years, most remain fundamentally weak in their financial and managerial capacities, as well as in their ability to develop more effective educational delivery mechanisms. The majority of schools has minimal financial expertise, weak information systems, if any, and limited opportunities for teacher training and curriculum development. The technical assistance program designed in conjunction with the financing facility is intended to address many of these shortcomings for participating schools, and, in addition, to strengthen the environment for private school operators.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category FI Type 1 project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.

The initial capitalization of the company is expected to be $5 million and will be expanded to $15 million by the end of its fourth year.  The sponsors of this project include First International Merchant Bank (FIMBank)  as a 40% equity investor, Commercial International Bank Egypt S.A.E. (CIB)  as a 40% equity investor, and IFC holding the remaining 20% of the company's shares.  FIMBank will play the key role as technical partner capitalizing on its international expertise in factoring.  CIB will bring its local market expertise and client base into the new venture by leveraging on its existing market presence.  The company plans to start its operations with international factoring representing between 50-60% of the total business volume, and the rest divided between local factoring and small-ticket forfaiting.  Initially, the company will fund itself through equity, going forward other funding sources will be sourced at the local level.    

The project would create Egypt's first factoring company and is expected to cater to the needs of Egyptian exporters who currently require additional liquidity to fund their growing business needs.  With 38% of Egyptian exports flowing to the United States and Europe (countries with significant factoring activity), Egypt's export-oriented firms would be ideal for export factoring, given the exporters' short-term financing requirements and the relatively lower importer risk. The company would aim to be a one-stop-shop for exporters in Egypt and is expected to have a strong positive impact by enhancing the level of credit being made available to exporters in Egypt.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a category C project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.

The project's main objective is to address the scarcity of term finance in Nigeria. Despite a recent improvement in political stability and a commitment to market-oriented economic reform, Nigeria has yet to attract a level of foreign investment in line with the size of its economy. This is creating a critical constraint in the country's development goals, particularly as significant investments are needed to upgrade private sector productive capacity and operations to sustainable levels, and finance the privatization of major industries which the government has planned.

GTB was founded in the early 1990s by Mr. Fola Adeola, (member of GTB's Board) and Mr. Olutayo Aderinokun (current Managing Director/CEO).  The two sponsors, who both had prior banking experience, felt that the time was right to start a niche bank because of the void created by the departure of most foreign banks from Nigeria.  GTB was incorporated in July 1990, obtained its banking license in August 1990, commenced operations in February 1991 and was listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange in 1996.   GTB provides a full range of financial services to its customers, mainly mid to top tier corporate and institutional clients, and high net worth individuals. GTB is predominantly a commercial bank with a national branch network covering the major commercial/industrial centers in Nigeria. The operations are supported by a strong technology platform which links the entire branch network via a Wide Area Network with real time capabilities. GTB is also diversifying its activities both in terms of services and geography. Over the last two fiscal years, the Bank acquired an insurance company and opened two subsidiary in Gambia and Sierra Leone.

Project rationale:  The project would allow YUCE to build on its continuous growth in private education and equip a leading Turkish school with modern facilities and improve the quality of its curriculum.  Improving school development, the quality of teaching and introducing education technologies into schools are key components of the system of education reforms allowing Turkey's accession to the EU.  The project will also allow a leader in educational software development to further increase its business volume as a provider of education management systems in a growing market.  Finally, the project would assist the sponsor in reducing expensive short-term debt and hence high financial charges, with long-term funding that is more adequate for capital investments. 

YUCE was established in 1983 in the Kizilay district, downtown Ankara, initially as a private preparatory school, providing students enhanced skills to allow them to pass the national university entrance exam.  The passing results of its students was so exceptional that YUCE soon acquired a very good reputation and established in 1988 the first private Scientific High School in Turkey, with a major focus on basic sciences such as mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology.  Today, YUCE has a K-12 operation with over 1,500 students, the YUCE IT Academy which opened in November 2000 and offers long-term IT career courses and YUCE Information Systems for software development and certified professional computer programs.","","","","","","","","","","","This a category B project according to IFCs environmental and social review because a limited number of specific environmental and/or social impacts may result which, can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

Kingamyambo Musonoi Tailings SARL,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Africa,"Congo, Democratic Republic of",KINGAMYAMBO MUSONOI TAILINGS (KMT) SARL,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2005-03-22T05:00:00Z,2005-05-12T04:00:00Z,B,Equity,"This SPI has been revised in order to reflect a slight change in the wording related to the process of categorization of any potential future investment in this project to ensure consistency with IFC procedures.The project is to prepare a definitive feasibility study (DFS), including marketing, technical, and environmental and social impact studies, for the re-treatment of processed oxide tailings from the Kolwezi concentrator, located in Katanga province, which began operations in the early 1950s. Owing to the poor recovery rates obtained at the time, valuable amounts of copper and cobalt were discharged in the form of tailings. The tailings reserve consists of 112 million tonnes grading 1.49% copper and 0.32% cobalt. Preliminary technical studies indicate that a leaching and solvent extraction plant costing about US$300 million could produce 30,000  tonnes per annum (tpa) of copper and 5,500 tpa of cobalt, although technical,  marketing, and financing factors, to be considered during the DFS, may dictate a staged development. The project company is Kingamyambo Musonoi Tailings SARL (KMT), a Congolese company which has been created for the purpose of exploiting the tailings.","","","","","","","","","The DRC is emerging from a prolonged period of instability and conflict. The countrys mining sector offers the best prospect for generating significant economic activity in the near term. For this reason, one of the World Banks priorities after re-engaging in DRC was to assist with updating DRCs mining code and detailed mining regulations. With these now passed into law, a key pre-condition for foreign investment in the mining sector has been met, and it is hoped that the early start up of some major private sector mining projects will send an important signal to both the people of DRC and to foreign investors, that the reform process is on the right track. The tailings at Kolwezi represent one of the most technically viable projects in DRCs mining sector, and their commercial exploitation should be relatively fast, because no mining would be involved. A successful DFS should enable financing and development of the processing plant to proceed relatively quickly, which would have the following development impacts: (i) it would generate significant foreign exchange earnings, and pay royalties, income tax and dividends to the government of DRC; (ii) it would stimulate the revival of regional infrastructure through the transport of goods; (iii) it would provide significant training and employment (estimated at 700 direct jobs for a full scale project); and (iv) it would have a powerful demonstration effect for other investors, and hopefully serve to encourage other mining investments in DRC to proceed. IFCs early engagement in the production of the DFS will enable it to play the following roles: (i) it will work with the Sponsor to maximise the sustainability of the future operation, and to ensure that the environmental and social baseline and impact studies that will be prepared as part of the DFS will be fully compliant with IFCs policies and guidelines; and (ii) IFCs presence in the Project should help attract other investors to complete the financing plan and enable the commercial development of the tailings project.","","This project has been categorized as a Category B project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedure as it is an equity investment to provide funding for a feasibility study, detailed engineering and environmental and social assessment (ESIA) documentation. Any future mine development financing would be appraised by IFC as a new project, with a new environmental classification based upon the projects risks and impacts. Based upon review of existing environmental documentation, it is considered likely that IFC support for future mine development financing at the site would be classified as a Category A project according to IFCs Environmental & Social Review Procedure.The Category A ESIA documentation is currently under preparation and will be reviewed and approved by IFC to ensure that, prior to financing and construction, the development stage meets IFC environmental and social standards.Location of environmental documents In locally affected communityThe Environmental Review Summary (ERS) and the initial Environmental Audit completed by SRK during 2003 and the Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan (PCDP) as well as the Public Scoping Report (PSR) are available at the offices of CMD and KMT in Lubumbashi and Kolwezi for consultation by the public, at the following addresses:KMT SARL, Villa Munua, Route de Golf, Golf, Lubumbashi, DRCKMT SARL , 617 Avenue Lumumba, Zone Manika, Kolwezi, DRCThe Sponsors Environmental and Social Policies, Community Development Policy and PCDP can be found on Adastras website: http://www.adastramin.com/","KMT is currently owned 82.5% by Congo Mineral Developments Limited (CMD), 12.5% by Gécamines, the state-owned mining company, and 5% by the government of DRC.

Lukoil Petrotel,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,Romania,PETROTEL - LUKOIL SA,Regional Industry - MAS ECA,2005-04-05T04:00:00Z,2005-05-05T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"OAO Lukoil is Russia's largest integrated oil company.  In 1998, Lukoil acquired the Petrotel refinery from the Romanian government through a privatization process.  Since then, Lukoil has expanded its downstream operations in Romania to include about 300 retail petrol stations, 60 LPG filling skids and 8 petroleum distribution centers throughout the country.  Through these targeted investments, Lukoil succeeded in creating a fully-integrated business chain starting at the oil well in Russia and going all the way downstream to the pump in Romania.  Apart from the Romanian fuel wholesale and fuel retail market, Lukoil's Romanian operations also cater to the Moldavian market and other export markets through Lukoil's international trading company, Litasco International S.A.  

The project involves the modernization and revamping program of S.C. Petrotel-Lukoil S.A. (Petrotel), its Romanian refinery.  The project is aimed at:

-  providing high quality petroleum products to Romanian consumers that comply with European Euro-3 and Euro-4 standards, 
-  improving refinery operations by increasing the output of higher value petroleum products and reduce emissions and energy consumption; and providing high quality petroleum products to Romanian consumers that comply with European Euro-3 and Euro-4 standards.  

This in turn will strengthen the overall long-term competitive position of Lukoil's entire downstream network.","","","","","","","","","
The proposed project will have the following development impacts: 

-  As part of Lukoil's operations in Romania, Petrotel forms a crucial element of a professionally run downstream business, which can serve as benchmark for other players.

-  Romania's refining sector is a legacy of the COMECON time with too many refineries at sub-optimal size.  Lukoil's investment in the downstream industry will facilitate rationalization of Romania's refining sector, by helping to remove overcapacity and loss-making players.  By streamlining the industry, the overall economics of the refining sector in Romania will be strengthened, allowing for a market-driven approach.

-  Together with the privatization of Petrom, which was acquired in 2004 by Austria's OMV, the project will reduce the need for the Government of Romania's involvement in the downstream industry.  This by itself is a benefit for the entire economy as western business practices are increasingly adopted.

-  Lukoil's investments in the Romanian economy will also be perceived as a showcase for a successful privatization.  Not only has Lukoil honored its commitment to carry out the modernization program as part of the privatization contract, but it will keep investing in the Romanian economy through the expansion of its gas station network and other activities.

-  In view of Romania's aspired EU accession, Petrotel's modernization program allows Lukoil to supply Euro-3 and Euro-4 fuels (the latest EU fuel Specifications) to Romania, as well as bring new technology to the country's debilitated refining sector, moving Romania's refining industry closer to EU best practices.

-  Due to the modernization program, Petrotel's air emissions have been reduced and meet IFC, EU and Romanian emissions standards, as low NOx burners are installed in boilers and heaters. 

-  As part of the modernization program, $11 million were spent for a wide-ranging environmental improvement program as part of Lukoil's obligation to the Government of Romania to carry out environmental clean-up work.  

-  Lukoil has trained and will continue training its Romanian staff to improve on current working practices, as well as health and safety standards.

-  Petrotel has total direct employment of 1,241 staff.  Moreover, Lukoil has currently 3,819 staff employed at its petrol station network and distribution facilities throughout Romania, which brings the total employment for Lukoil to 5,060.  All of Lukoil's operations will create substantial backward linkages in the country's economy.

The proposed project fits well with the World Bank Group strategy of promoting private sector development in a key sector that has been traditionally important for Romania.  In addition, it is in line with IFC's strategy of supporting the increase of foreign investment flows and investor confidence in the country.

IFC's participation in the project would enable the company to obtain adequate long-term financing at reasonable terms.  In addition to providing direct financing, IFC would serve as a catalyst by mobilizing sources in Europe via a B loan syndication at a time when limited access to long-term financing is available in Romania for these type of projects.  IFC has played a key role in structuring the financial plan, and evaluating environmental issues, thus reducing the project's risk profile.  In view of the perceived macroeconomic and political risks of investing in Romania, IFC's participation together with Lukoil, a regional leader in oil, gas and petrochemicals, will have a significant demonstration effect in supporting foreign direct investment in Romania.","","This is a category B project according to IFC''s Environmental Review Procedure.  Key environmental issues associated with this project include environmental and social management capacity, soil contamination, air emissions, liquid effluents, solid waste management, fire/explosion safety and emergency response, storage and transport safety, and logistics and safety handling for product distribution system.

Key social issues include public/community relations and community development including the possibility of implementing SME initiatives.

Throughput at Lukoil's refineries amounted to 43.8 million mt in 2004.  Lukoil's shares are publicly traded on the Russian stock exchanges (RTS, MICEX, SPICEX, SSE) and its ADRs and GDRs trade on the US over-the-counter market and exchanges in London, Berlin, Frankfurt, Munich and Stuttgart. Lukoil became the first Russian company to obtain  London Stock Exchange (LSE) listing in 2002.  

In September 2004, the Russian Government sold its remaining 7.59% stake in Lukoil to Houston-based ConocoPhillips, who has since indicated it will increase its stake to up to 20% and become a major equity investor.  

Following an internal reorganization in 2000, the sponsor's international assets were placed with Lukoil Overseas Limited B.V. for upstream operations and Lukoil International GmbH for downstream operation.  Petrotel's shares are owned by Lukoil Europe Holding B.V., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lukoil International GmbH, (93.67%), the investment company S.I.F.

However, in the interest of expediting the refinery modernization, the sponsor provided its own bridge financing to commence project implementation.

The first phase of the proposed project, after being developed, will be able to accommodate up to 3,000 students and staff. The project will be the first for-profit, wholly foreign-owned university in the country. The government of Vietnam promulgated, on March 6, 2000, a new decree governing wholly foreign-owned, for-profit, medical, educational, and technical training institutions. RMIT Vietnam is the first company licensed under this decree.The project will alleviate the acute shortage of high-quality colleges and universities in Vietnam. Only one out of six applicants can enter a college or a university in Vietnam at present, which leaves every year one million candidates to either prepare for the next year's exams or look for jobs. In addition, Vietnam has a huge shortage of people with foreign languages, business management, computer and other technical skills. The project, by providing degree programs, and short-term foreign languages and professional training adapted to the market needs, will make significant contribution to the development of human capital in Vietnam. It will also make it possible for thousands of Vietnamese students, who do not have the financial means to study abroad, to receive western-style university education in Vietnam. The project will help enhance the quality of higher education in Vietnam by introducing well-developed academic programs, quality assurance systems, and professional management, at the level of those offered in Australia.

Cinema Park was established in 2002 and currently operates from its offices in Moscow.,"","","","","","","","","The project's expected development impact are in the following areas :

-  Affordable Leisure: 
Providing affordable, safe and good quality entertainment and cultural options for the Russian middle class, especially for the young.  In-doors entertainment is particularly important in Russia given its severe weather conditions for most part of the year.

-  Infrastructure: 
Providing infrastructure for a modernizing and fast growing media sector, with spillover effects to other sectors of the economy.  In addition, cinemas help create traffic and extend hours of shopping malls, which is critical to the success of modern retail, a sector IFC is promoting. Clustering leisure facilities like stores, cinemas and restaurants makes efficient use of urban infrastructure including parking lots and access facilities or services
-  Environmental and Social: 
The project will elevate environmental and social standards in the Russian cinema sector.  The company will produce a Master Fire and Life Safety Plan following international standards (German DIN or equivalent), to be designed by international expert consultants acceptable to IFC.  Cinema Park's cinemas will include special facilities for the disabled at international standards, including special hearing aids for the hearing impaired in selected cinemas.

-  Local Content: 
By creating the audiences that creates demand for investors to inject money to the production side of the chain, the Project will indirectly support the production of local films.  The company plans to become an advocate of local film production by supporting the Golden Eagle Award for young local film producers.  

-  Piracy: 
The project will also help counter piracy in media products by increasing the supply of affordable, legitimate products widely within the Russian Federation and supporting an industry whose development will depend on a continued battle against piracy.

- Job Creation:
The project is expected to create over 500 permanent jobs throughout the country.

-  IFC Role: 
Through its investment, IFC will support the development, growth and diversification of a locally-owned and successfully operated company, a role IFC has played in only a select few of its general manufacturing projects to date in Russia.  IFC also has a role to play by providing long-term financing that is otherwise not available in Russia today for projects in the media/entertainment sector.  IFC's participation in the project will also lend credibility to Interros on international markets which, given Interros' considerable contribution to Russian GDP, will have a positive effect on the Russian economy as a whole.","","This is a category B project according to IFC''s Environmental and Social Review Procedure because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

Jamaica Energy Partners Expansion,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Jamaica,Jamaica Energy Partners Limited,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2005-04-18T04:00:00Z,2005-05-20T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"Jamaica Energy Partners (JEP) is a 74.2 MW barge-mounted power generation plant using medium-speed diesel engines burning heavy fuel oil.  Developed as a fast track project in 1995, it was the first Independent Power Producer commissioned on the island of Jamaica. The project sells its capacity and energy to Jamaica Public Service Company (JPSCo), the national integrated public utility and the grid operator, which was publicly-owned at that time, under a twenty-year (20) PPA contract and a thirty-year (30) electrical license. IFC provided financing for JEP in 1997.  

Jamaica relies almost entirely on imports of fuel oil to power its generation plants.  The high cost of fuel and other factors contribute to the high electricity tariff in Jamaica.  Under a long-term development plan, the Government of Jamaica is seeking to build larger and more efficient plants and secure cheaper sources of fuel for Jamaica.  However, to meet the continuing demand growth on the island, a 50 MW capacity addition was urgently needed by end 2005.

In 2004, JEP and JPSCo signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to deliver additional capacity.  As per the MOU, JEP will increase its capacity from the currently installed level of 74.2 MW to 123.6 MW by building a 49.5 MW barge-mounted plant based on updated diesel engine technology burning the same heavy fuel oil.  The new barge will be located at a leased site, 200 feet alongshore the existing barge.

JPSCo, 80% owned by Mirant Corporation of the US since 2001, will purchase JEP's aggregate capacity and power under a 20 year Power Purchase Agreement.  Petrojam, the current fuel supplier of the existing capacity, will continue to supply fuel oil under a Fuel Supply Agreement.   

The Project also involves restructuring JEP's existing debt (which has a final maturity in 2007 and 2009) with debt of longer-maturity (15 years). This will reduce JEP's debt service burden, allowing it to offer JPSCo a lower charge for the capacity of the whole expanded plant which will benefit Jamaican consumers also. The IFC's involvement in the financing will not only mobilize financing from commercial lenders in a difficult market but demonstrate as a vote of confidence its support of private participation in the development of the infrastructure to the Jamaican economy thereby boosting investor confidence in the country.","","","","","","","","","","","An environmental impact assessment (EIA) has been prepared for the project to meet the requirements of the Jamaican environmental agency, NEPA.  The key environmental issue for the project is air quality impacts and cumulative air quality at Old Harbour.  JEP has developed a mitigation plan for SO2 emissions to address this issue.  Other issues analyzed for the project included dredging and site preparation, noise from plant operation, cooling water discharge, discharge of sewage and storm water, spill control, occupational health and safety, and environmental compliance of the existing JEP plant.Location of environmental documents in locally affected communityDr. Bird Power Station, Old Harbour Bay ,

Until 2000, when a 14% stake of the Bank was sold to external parties, the Bank had been 100% owned by the RoB.  In late 2003, 72.5% of the Bank was acquired by companies related to the Nikoil Financial Corporation (Nikoil FC), a major Russian financial group that owns and controls two commercial banks, IBG-Nikoil Bank (Nikoil) and Avtobank-Nikoil (Avtobank) as well as several other banking financial companies such as factoring, leasing, insurance and asset management.  The acquisition of the Bank was part of an expansion process initiated by Nikoil FC to bring together one of the most complete financial groups in Russia. The new merged group will be among top 5 banking institutions in Russia.
.","","","","","","","","","This project is expected to have a significant development impact in developing the financial sector and the private sector in Russia.  As one of the first post-crisis IFC loans to a Russian bank with a large regional network, it will help increase geographical diversification and outreach by making credits available to SMEs throughout Russia.   Moreover, the IFC loan will provide additional resources for the banking sector, thereby allowing it to play a more effective role in the development of the private sector through financial intermediation.

By providing this loan, IFC would:

Help a major Russian bank with a strong presence in the regions to expand its funding base and extend its maturity profile, thus enabling it to provide longer-term funds to its SME clients.  
Support UralSib's growth and therefore, improve financial intermediation and foster competition among new and existing players.
Improving operational standards at UralSib FC, thereby setting a positive example for other Russian banks.
Send a positive signal to international financial community about IFC's commitment to Russia and to the development of the private sector in the country.

IMB, established on January 2005, will offer variety of products ranging from housing purchase loans to housing improvement loans.  Local banks in Ukraine currently lack expertise in housing finance sector and this new specialized bank with its standardized underwriting guidelines will act as a role model in development of housing finance sector in Ukraine.","","","","","","","","","Project Development Impact:

The development impact of this project should be positive in many respects.

-  This project will provide a world class model for mortgage origination and servicing that can be used as an objective standard for the rest of the market to follow.

-  This project will stimulate a higher level of competition in the primary market which can only benefit the market as a whole.  Consumers will have more choices, lower prices and better customer service.  The lenders will bring their craft to a higher level of performance and productivity.  Finally, long term investors will realize a higher level of confidence and more readily seek mortgage products in securitized form, benefiting the development of the capital markets.

-  This project and its positive effects on other primary market participants will stimulate new home building, causing existing construction firms to offer affordable products perhaps of improved quality, while stimulating new entrants into the construction sector.  The flow-through effects of this on employment in both the professional trades and in the unskilled labour forces should be quite significant.

The increased level of homeownership engendered by all the forces described above and the increased expenditures stemming from new homeowners on improvements to their new homes will act as a catalyst in development of downstream industries and the economy of Ukraine at large.

IFC's Role

The primary mortgage market of Ukraine needs to be bolstered.  The mortgage market needs to be competitive and consumers need to have choices.  Both consumers and participating institutions will benefit from new competition.  This competition will be an antidote for the relatively low level of transparency currently found in many banking firms in Ukraine today.  IFC's most obvious role is to foster this competition.  In addition, bringing this new primary market originator and mortgage loan servicer will introduce a world class model for other participants to emulate.  IFC by virtue of its world wide experience and staff expertise is best positioned to champion and help sponsor the introduction of a world-class competitor to this emerging mortgage market.  

The proposed investment fits well within IFC's strategy and the overall Bank Group strategy for Ukraine as this will be the first attempt to establish a specialized housing finance institution in the country, with the intentions of providing alternative source of funding to purchase residential real estate and further deepening Ukraine's financial sector.","",This is an environmental and social review category C project.Location of environmental documents in locally affected community,"The Western NIS Enterprise Fund is a not-for-profit corporation formed to promote the development of the private sector and the policies and practices conducive to such development of the Western NIS region, which consists of Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova.

The Project, a $26 million investment program, will assist DAF in the following:

-  capacity buildup with expansion from 112 beds to 138 beds and establishment of a training center for para-medicals;
-  the acquisition of an existing hospital in Cairo;
-  a regional expansion through the opening of 4 outpatient clinics in the KSA and the Gulf region;
-  a refinancing of a portion of its existing debt in order to extend maturities.

The company is increasing its share capital through a private placement arranged by Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) for an additional 600,000 shares representing 34% of the share capital of DAF.  400,000 shares have already been placed.

Project Rationale: The project will support much needed quality healthcare in Egypt and will expand DAF's high margin/high growth tertiary care services.  IFC's equity/quasi equity investment will contribute to:

-  further dilute public sector ownership through participation in the private placement; 
-  enhance DAF's credit profile for a potential IPO which timeframe is estimated to be within the next 3-5 years; and 
-  assist the hospital in its regional growth/credit enhancement with local banks and allow maturity extension of existing debt. 

The Hospital has been accredited in 2002 with the ISO 9000-2001 certification and has very recently (July 2005), been accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.  Its accreditation was carried out through one appraisal visit by JCAHO, which is unusual, more often two or even three visits are required to complete accreditation.","","","","","","","","","","","This is a category B project according to IFCs Procedures for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

The project will allow the company to grow its housing finance operations and establish a market based housing finance program. IFC will also consider taking a small equity/quasi equity position in KIC. The rationale for the equity investment would to help KIC develop its business further along industry best practice lines and to eventually become a housing finance bank once the law establishing housing finance banks in Saudi Arabia has been enacted.

Through its investment, IFC will help the company in its preparation and transition to becoming a non-bank housing finance institution IFCs equity investment will be considered following due diligence and only if there is a robust role for IFC, and a potential for an upside can be established as well as appropriate exit mechanisms can be identified or negotiated with the sponsors.  IFC will play a catalytic role in introducing the company to a potential technical partner (HDFC etc) in helping them convert into a housing finance bank.   Under the proposed securitization, KIC will issue MBS backed by a pool of Shariah-compliant housing finance contracts originated in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The issue will represent the first Shariah-compliant MBS issued in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. The MBS would allow the KIC to diversify its funding sources by tapping the regional capital markets and enhance its liquidity needed to originate additional housing finance contracts especially as the company launches a new growth phase of its housing finance operations. The project will also introduce a high quality new shariah compliant asset class to the regional markets. KIC has engaged Unicorn Investment Bank (UIB) out of Bahrain as arranger/placement agent, Lovells (London), who has an extended legal practice in Islamic financing and securitization, as the lead counsel and White and Case (Saudi Arabia) as local counsel for the MBS.

Mr. Bazhaev's original business was based on trading petroleum products and crude oil, which he bought in Russia and sold on international markets.  Several years of trading, combined with high-level management assignments in then troubled oil companies, allowed Mr. Bazhaev and his team to develop expertise in managing petroleum related businesses.  When founded in 1998, the Group offered its turnaround management services to troubled companies operating in the areas of oil and gas extraction and refining, petroleum product distribution, machine building, petrochemical production, and transport logistics.  Assignments were carried out in exchange for fees and equity stakes or equity options in the underlying companies.  As the acquired companies were turned into profit-making enterprises, this resulted in the creation of significant shareholder value for Alliance Group.
