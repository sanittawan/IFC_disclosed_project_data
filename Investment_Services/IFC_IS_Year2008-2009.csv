Banco GyT,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Guatemala,BANCO G AND T CONTINENTAL S.A.,"Global Industry, Financial Markets",2008-01-09T05:00:00Z,2008-02-28T05:00:00Z,FI,Equity,"The proposed investment consists of the subscription of Tier I capital in a locally-owned Guatemalan bank through an IFC injection of up to $68 million in preferred shares to be issued by Banco GyT Continental S.A. (Banco GyT or the client).  

Like all other Guatemalan banks, Banco GyT has a portion of subordinated debt, which the client and the regulatory authorities consider as Tier II capital and include it in the calculation of regulatory capital ratios.  However, when rating agencies assess a bank's adjusted risk capital, this subordinated debt is currently not being included as Tier I capital, leading to substantial undercapitalized ratios and excessive penalization of the client's credit rating.  Based on preliminary discussions between the client, IFC and the rating agencies, preferred shares can be considered as Tier I capital and, consequently, improve capitalization ratios.  Currently, the client's Tier I/Total Assets ratio, is 6% (as of October 2007). With the proposed investment, Banco GyT's ratio would increase to above 8.35%. 

Given its closed shareholding structure and its centralized decision making, the client does not prefer to open up its common shareholding to external investors at this stage and prefers to materialize this capital injection through preferred shares.","","","","","","The objective of IFC's proposed investment in Banco GyT will address some of the Guatemalan banking sector's deficiencies, thereby creating the following development impacts:

- Recapitalization:  

One of the financial sector's most pressing needs is the infusion of fresh Tier I capital into the system.  The proposed investment will help recapitalize a major player and will go a long way to improve the system's solvency issues.

- Restoring the Banking Sector's Credibility:  

The need for intervention of Bancomer and Bancafé put the regulatory authorities in an awkward position and has partly undermined the sector's credibility, even though the authorities managed to reduce wide spread damage.  The fact that a foreign institution will invest in Tier I capital will enhance Banco GyT's credibility and bolster the sector's overall image.

- Reducing Fragmentation: 

Given its size, Guatemala's banking industry has too many players, and they therefore have not been able to reach the crucial size to achieve efficiency levels common in this sector in other countries.  The investment in a leading player's Tier I capital will equip it to grow its balance sheet and have the means to acquire smaller competitors in the domestic market.  Thus, the proposed investment will contribute to further consolidation.

- South-to-South Investments:  

As part of its strategic plan, Banco GyT intends to further expand into neighboring countries through merger and acquisitions.  A stronger capital base will facilitate the implementation of the client's expansion.

- Access to Finance:  

Guatemala is one of the most under-banked markets in Latin America, but banks with economies of scale and higher efficiencies are better prepared to provide access to financial services to underserved regions.  While certain areas of Guatemala's urban centers are well penetrated, large swaths of rural areas are poorly or not at all served.  A strong capital base will provide the means to a player with a strong market presence to reach the unbanked.","","","","","This transaction has been classified as a Category FI project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

- corporate banking for medium-sized and large companies, 
- banking for small businesses,

The proposed project is IFC's first significant initiative to help develop Turkey's nascent market for Energy Efficiency (EE).  The loan will finance the expansion of YKL's leasing portfolio to SMEs with a special focus on financing EE projects. 

In addition, the German development agency, Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW), is also considering to finance up to EUR30 million for EE related subloans on similar terms and conditions to IFC's financing. In this respect, the proposed project is part of a broader partnership between IFC and KfW to support the development of EE finance through Financial Intermediaries (FIs) in Central and Eastern Europe.","","","","","","The project is expected to have multiple development impacts, including: 

- Promoting EE Finance: 

IFC support in development of leasing financial products for energy efficient and renewable energy equipment will help the end users to find proper financing and to raise awareness.  

- Reduced Energy Consumption and Reduced Pollution: 

The leasing sub-projects are expected to reduce energy consumption for the relevant industries i.e. light industries (textile, printing, food), power and heat generation etc.) as well as in industrial and commercial buildings. Reduced energy consumption is a global priority, as well as important at the national level in the interest of reducing dependence on imported energy.  Investments in energy efficiency offer a cost effective way to meet growing energy demand while reducing emissions.  Benefits to environment will result from reducing pollution emissions (as a result of reduction of energy use and materials).  Reduced pollution may result in improved health and living-environment quality for those in the vicinity of the plants. Reduced pollution, particularly CO2, will also contribute to efforts to mitigate the effects of global warming. 
 
- Increasing Access to Finance for SMEs: 

This project will help expand SMEs' access to critically-needed term finance for non-EE projects as well.  Leasing companies have traditionally been one of the key providers of term finance for SMEs, and this project will help make term finance available to more SMEs by working with an SME-focused leasing company.","","","","","This project has been classified as a Category FI project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

Sabanci is one of the leading industrial and financial conglomerates in Turkey, and Verbund is the largest vertically integrated electricity group in Austria.  The joint venture will develop and operate a generation portfolio of hydropower, gas, coal, and wind power plants, as well as distribution and supply and wholesale/trading.  IFCs funds would not be used for any nuclear power investments by the company.Through its own development, EnerjiSA currently owns and operates four natural gas-fired combined cycle and combined cycle-cogeneration plants (65 to 120 MW electricity capacity), and as a result of acquisitions owns and operates four hydroelectric power plants with capacities ranging from 7 to 48.5 MW.  The project is to finance the first phase of EnerjiSAs capital investment program, covering the 2008 to 2012 period. The first phase envisions the construction of the 933 MW Bandirma natural gas fired thermal power plant in western Turkey adjacent to the Marmara Sea, and  according to current planning  ten hydroelectric power plants with total capacity of 972MW, including Cambasi (45 MW) in the Solakli River basin in northern Turkey; Kusakli (29MW), Kavsakbendi (175 MW) Yamanli II (79 MW), Kopru (120 MW), and Menge (55 MW), located in the Seyhan River basin in the south of Turkey; and Dagdelen (11MW), Kandil (214 MW), Hacininoglu (142 MW), and Sariguzel (103 MW), located in the Ceyhan River basin in the south-east of Turkey.  A technical and economic optimization of the individual projects is going on.

(EnerjiSA or the company), secured with its underlying portfolio of energy assets and contracts, to finance the first phase of EnerjiSAs capital investment program for the 2008 to 2012 period.  IFCs proposed investment will be in parallel with financing arranged by the Turkish commercial bank Akbank and the European commercial bank WestLB headquartered in Germany.The project consists of the construction of a portfolio of one natural gas-fired thermal plant (TPP) and  according to current planning  ten hydroelectric power plants (HPP) in various locations throughout Western and Southern Turkey with total capacity of approximately 1.9 GW with an estimated cost of $2.0 billion (EUR1.4 billion) (Phase I), representing the initial phase of Enerjisas overall capital investment aimed at developing 5.0 GW in generation capacity by 2015.","","","","","","Turkey is facing a serious electricity shortage, expected as early as 2009, due to a combination of sustained economic growth and lack of adequate investments in the energy sector in recent years. To address the critical situation, the Government of Turkey (GOT) has embarked on implementing an on-going liberalization program of the Turkish electricity sector, including the preparation for the privatization of state-owned electricity distribution and generation assets. Consequently, several of the local private groups, many of which are already auto generators for their own industries, have begun expanding their power generating capacity, either independently or by the means of partnerships with experienced international power operators. Despite the growing risk appetite from commercial lenders to finance power generation assets, the sector exhibits significant commercial risks and regulatory uncertainties during the transition period, impeding the availability of long-term financing for the merchant power projects, in the absence of long-term power purchase agreements (PPA).The project will have a high development impact as it will: - contribute to the development of a merchant power operator in Turkey where ongoing structural and regulatory changes have introduced additional uncertainty for prospective investors; - finance the construction of power generation capacity of approximately 1.9 GW and meet incremental power demand in Turkey given the expected supply shortage in 2009; - support the power sector reforms in Turkey as the plants built within the scope of the project will not benefit from any government guarantees contrary to the existing independent power producers. Moreover, the project is expected to demonstrate the viability of a liberalized power sector to other potential private entrants to the sector.  Due to its reliance on hydro and natural gas as energy sources, the project will contribute to reducing Turkeys reliance on coal, thereby reducing carbon intensity and improving security of supply.","","","","","The proposed project is a corporate loan to EnerjiSA, for which the funds will be used for construction of specific power plants.

- Providing financing and active management oversight to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that demonstrate potential for profitable growth in sub-Saharan Africa, starting out with seven countries, namely, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa, and then identifying and expanding to more countries using the same transferable business model;
- Providing returns to investors through dividends and capital gains from these investments in small businesses.  The Manager plans to reach more than 500 companies, in contrast to a typical private equity fund that invests in 10-15 companies.","","","","","","The Fund will deliver strong development impact by: 

- Providing access to financing for up to 500 SMEs in Africa which lack risk financing.  The Fund will make investments ranging from $50,000 to $1 million in target companies.

Nitol Solar,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,Russian Federation,NITOL SOLAR LIMITED,"Gbl Ind, Manufact, Agribus & Services",2008-03-12T04:00:00Z,2008-04-17T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"The proposed transaction is a $75 million loan and equity investment in Nitol Solar Limited (Nitol or the company), to facilitate the construction of a 3,700 metric tonnes per annum polycrystalline silicon (PCS or polysilicon) manufacturing facility in Russia at a total cost of about $450 million.  Nitol is a vertically integrated chemical and silicon gas producer based in Russias Irkutsk region (south-eastern Siberia), with access to abundant rock salt and low cost energy.  The company is currently one of the largest Russian producers of chlorine based compounds, such as trichloroethylene, calcium hypochlorite, epichlorohydrin and polyvinylchloride (PVC) emulsion, as well as silicon gases.","","","","","","- Supporting Growth of Renewable Energy:  Solar power is developing into a key renewable energy source and globally, the sector is witnessing growth rates in excess of 30% per annum.  Nitols Project will be producing polysilicon, the main material from which solar cells are manufactured.  Upon completion of the Project, Nitols polysilicon output would be equivalent to about 300MW of solar power per annum.- Employment Preservation:  Nitol has about 5,100 employees and is a key source of employment for the immediate region.  The Project would support Nitols future growth by allowing the company to diversify away from commodity chemicals into polysilicon, a high growth sector.  As a result, the company expects to preserve the employment of its existing workforce and also create additional jobs (directly and indirectly) as it grows.  This would be a key development impact, promoting stability in a less developed region (Irkutsk GDP is 16% below national average).- Environmental Correction:  Land adjacent to Nitols chlor-alkali facilities has legacy contamination issues from mercury sludge generated by the facilities prior to their privatization.  Although, this land is owned by the local authorities, Nitol has volunteered to conduct a base-line study to assess the degree of contamination and, subsequently, develop a remediation program to address the issue.  - Resource Diversification:  The project would be adding value to domestic non-hydrocarbon resources, thereby, helping diversify the countrys dependence on oil and gas revenues as well as generate export revenues.  - Enhancing Domestic Corporate Governance Standards:  Nitols intended listing on London Stock Exchange would be the first full listing for a Russian company (i.e. not a GDR or AIM listing) and includes Nitols commitment to conform to the UK Combined Code of Governance.  This would have a demonstration effect to other Russian companies, given their reputation for limited transparency.","","","","","- Environmental ConsiderationsNitol has a corporate EHS coordinator, who oversees the EHS activities of Nitols operations.  It also has dedicated personnel at each of its two divisions to ensure the operations comply with:- the local EHS requirements; - Nitols corporate EHS initiatives; and now; - IFC requirements.  The company is also working towards ISO 14001 and OSHAS 18001 for all its operations.As part of managing the environmental conditions of its operations, Nitol conducted an environmental audit of its chemical division in 2007 and also commissioned an EIA for the TCS project.  For the polysilicon project, Nitol will commission a second EIA which is expected to be ready in July 2008.Nitol complies with the local requirement about maintaining a buffer zone (sanitary protective zone) between the industrial complex and the communities.  The sanitary protective zone, which surrounds the industrial site, extents in a 1.5 km radius.  The company has an ambient air monitoring program in place to assess the impact of its operations in the communities. The monitoring results obtained indicate that the communities are not affected by Nitol operations.  With Nitols mitigation measures for the new project, the communities will not be affected either.The company has procedures to conduct training of employees and contractors and has in place a rigorous system to conduct monitoring of air emissions, ambient air, liquid effluents, soil and ground water, and workplace conditions.  SGB will also develop procedures as well as hazard assessments. Since the beginning Nitol has been upgrading and improving the chemical division operations to reduce the amount of harmful compounds being released to the atmosphere, the surface waters and the disposed wastes.  In 2006, it reduced pollutant concentrations in the wastewater by 17%, total air emissions by 30% and total solid wastes by 12%.  However, it needs further enhance its operations to fully comply with the local and IFC requirements.  Even though, both the chemical and solar divisions have air pollution controls in place, the chemical division emits high particulate concentrations from several of its operations.  The on-site wastewater treatment plant is not sufficient to control high concentrations of chlorine, mercury, and hydrogen chloride.   The generation of wastes containing harmful compounds is also significant.  To that effect, Nitol has engaged in an action plan with the local authorities and now with IFC through an ESAP to implement measures that will install additional controls and upgrade processes to reduce air emissions, upgrade the wastewater treatment, upgrade the pipelines conducting liquid effluents, and other measures to allow the operations to reach compliance with the established requirements.From previous state ownership, up until 1998, Nitol produced chlor-alkali with mercury cells technology.  Poor practices and handling of wastes left a legacy of soil and ground contamination, mainly mercury, as well as a series of contaminated buildings.  Even though, it appears that this environmental liability has not been inherited by Nitol, the company is proactively working with the Irkutsk environmental authorities to establish the contamination baseline.  A study to be ready in April 2008 is being commissioned.  IFC is expecting to review such study to determine whether further evaluation is required.  In such a case IFC will use German trust funds who are highly interested in supporting this initiative. To further prevent soil and ground water contamination from its existing operations, Nitol will upgrade the conditions of several storage tanks still operating without double containment to reduce the likelihood of soil contamination from accidental spills.  Nitol has an on-going program to upgrade the safety of these tanks.  The new project at the solar division will improve existing controls and it is expected it will ensure satisfaction with all requirements.   Even though, Nitol operations mostly comply with the local requirements, such requirements are developed based on data submitted by the companies and the performance of the operations rather than established pre-set standards. The maximum allowable concentrations imposed to Nitol facilities by the local authorities are, in general, much higher that those in other local regulations.  From time to time, Nitol pays fines to the local environmental authorities for none-environmental compliance.  The low financial penalties imposed by the local authorities are an incentive for paying a fine rather than solving the environmental violation.- Occupational Health and SafetyThe health and safety condition of the operations is properly handled.  Most of the operations have emergency response and spill prevention programs, and/or alarms and overall safety prevention measures (i.e., alarms systems, fire prevention measures, use of personnel protective equipment, H&S signaling, employee training, etc.).Even though the company conducts EHS training for its employees, and personnel protective equipment is widely used, the work related statistics show that many of the incidents/accidents are caused due to lack of commitment to safety.  The chemical division has had few lethal accidents in the past.  The company has implemented response measures to prevent those from happening.  Nitol relies mainly on railroad and on trucks within its own premises to transport and deliver its raw materials and products. The railroad systems is operated by the local governments, however the company owns a fleet of railroad carts used for Nitols transportation needs.  To ensure that it minimizes and properly handles transport related accidents, Nitol has developed a Safety Transportation Plan.Nitol is contracting services to assist the company improving the overall management of its operations through the OSHAS 18001 certification.  As part of this program, Nitol anticipates to introduce risk based management tools to assess and reduce the operational EHS hazards, establish the framework to effectively manage the EHS aspects of the operations, and develop procedures to implement those initiatives. - Social AspectsIn addition to having programs to ensure the well being of the employees, Nitol also carries out social programs at the various subsidiaries.  It has a variety of programs to support the neighboring communities.  It has programs to support environmental education, enhance and embellish the town. Support in case of town wide disasters, etc. Nitol makes a practice of maintaining the community informed about its EHS performance by periodically publishing updates in local and regional communication media (i.e., newspapers, radio.)  In addition, Nitol has established a grievance mechanism through which the community can place complaints and in turn Nitol resolves, follows-up, registers, and monitors these complaints.Nitols human resources department structures awards and recognition programs for its employees, develop on-job training programs, and develop competence standards.Nitol has been reducing its labor force at the chemical division and it will/will not continue doing so as part of its overall operations enhancement.  However, for the new project, Nitol will generate employment and in temporary basis will also generate jobs during the construction phases.  Even though Nitol indicated that it complies with the local labor requirements, the company needs to prepare a retrenchment plan indicating the magnitude, rationale, and timeframe of the redundancies that already took place in addition to those scheduled in the near future.The company will not buy land for its new project nor will it be in sensitive ecological areas or areas of indigenous communities or cultural heritage.As part of this project Nitol will be required to - upgrade its wastewater treatment systems to reduce levels of harmful pollutants; - install air pollution controls to reduce particulate, chlorine and hydrogen chloride concentrations; - upgrade its operations to reduce generation of hazardous wastes; - develop a retrenchment plan; and - implement actions to avoid further soil and/or ground contamination from existing operations.","The project company is Usoliye Sibirskoye Silicon (USS) based in Ikutsk, Russia.  Nitol, which is based in New Jersey, owns 100% of USS through a group of holding companies.  Nitol is wholly owned by EcoLive (the Parent), an international investment holding company, based in Luxembourg.

Due to growing tourism, further encouraged by the current negotiations on an open skies agreement with Europe as well as major tourism and industrial developments planned to sustain the countrys growth, the upgrade and expansion of Tunisias airport infrastructure is a key Government priority. In 2007, the Government of Tunisia awarded two concessions to TAV of Turkey: - a concession to upgrade and operate the Monastir airport, and - a concession to build, finance and operate a new airport at Enfidha, also located in the Central Eastern part of Tunisia, 45 km away from the Monastir airport. Both airports will serve the major tourism areas of Monastir, Sousse and Hammamet, located on the Mediterranean coast.  The decision to build a new airport at Enfidha stemmed from the fact that the Monastir airport cannot be expanded on site, owing to geographical and environmental constraints.TAV created TAV Tunisie, a special purpose company which will be the concessionaire of the two airports.  The proposed project is to finance: - the concession for the construction and operation of a new international airport at Enfidha, for an initial capacity of 7 million passengers and - the concession for the operation of the existing Monastir international airport (4.2 million passengers in 2006). The project, with total costs of approx EUR560 million (approximately equivalent to $840 million), will be one the largest recent private sector investments in Tunisia and the 1st airport private sector concession in the Maghreb region.","","","","","","The proposed project is a central element of Tunisias growth strategy: by expanding and modernizing the airport infrastructure of Tunisia, the project is expected to directly contribute to the success of the Tunisias economic strategy, which is built on two pillars: - export-oriented industrialization, in particular with a specialization in low cost light manufacturing and - tourism development, with major efforts underway by the Tunisian Government to increase tourist arrival numbers and re-position Tunisia towards the higher end of the market. The project furthers both those goals as: - it will be critical to the development of the Enfidha industrial district and - it will considerably expand Tunisias tourism capacity by offering a new gateway to Tunisia, as the Monastir airport has reached saturation. The project, one of the largest private sector investments in Tunisia in recent years, will also be the 1st private airport concession in the Maghreb region and is a key factor in the success of the Tunisian Governments PPP strategy in infrastructure.","","","","","This project has been classified as a Category B project owing to the limited number of specific environmental and social impacts that may result from upgrading existing airport facilities and from construction of the new airport at Enfidha. These impacts, including land acquisition and resettlement (being implemented by the Government) are being managed closely and in accordance to international best practice. The new airport has been planned since 1998 and the Government has conducted several public meetings regarding the proposed development.  The Monastir Airport has been in operation for 40 years; the terminal will undergo minor modification, including safety, security and waste management upgrades, as part of the project.  The Enfidha Airport is currently under construction and will meet international standards.  Based on the location of the village of Hergla and the presence of two Important Bird Areas (IBA) 13 km north and south of the Concession, the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development required the suppression of a second (originally planned) runway to eliminate low level flights (and their subsequent noise impact) over human populations and sensitive habitats.  No impacts on these IBAs are anticipated due to the project.  The Government has developed a Master Plan for this region of the country which includes development of a deep water Port, Tourism Zone and an Industrial Zone.  Consultations on the proposed plans have occurred over the past several years and the project is well known at the local and national level.  A Cumulative Environmental Assessment and a Groundwater Study for the Master Plan are currently underway.  The Enfidha Airport is not anticipated to have any negative impacts on surface or groundwater.  While the project does include Government managed and implemented land acquisition and a small amount of resettlement (20 houses), this process is being managed through a very well defined process as mandated by Tunisian law and consistent with IFC Performance Standards.  Titled landowners are being compensated at independently negotiated market rates and all households will be given titled land adjacent to the concession.  Tenancy and livelihoods are expected to be improved as part of this process as all families are being given titled plots adjacent to the Concession and will be compensated for structures and losses.  TAV has presented plans to address the impacts and other requirements, and will, upon implementation of specific agreed measures, comply with the IFC Performance Standards on Social and Environmental Sustainability.","The projects sponsor and major shareholder (99.99%) of the project company (TAV Tunisia S.A.) is TAV Airports Holdings (TAV Airports), a Turkish company headquartered in Istanbul, specializing in airport operation and management.TAV Airports was established in 1997 after being awarded the BOT concession for the new international terminal in Istanbul and has grown fast to become a fully integrated airport services provider with affiliated companies are also involved, without limitation, in duty free operation (ATU), food and beverage operations (BTA) and ground handling (Havas).

The airport will have one 3,300m long runway and two apron areas, allowing for a total capacity of 32 aircraft stand. Upon completion of the 1st phase, the airports capacity will be 7 mn passengers.  Subsequent expansions will be realized as needed to satisfy traffic growth.  It is expected that the Enfidha airport will cater mainly to tourists.","This project has been classified as a Category B project owing to the limited number of specific environmental and social impacts that may result from upgrading existing airport facilities and from construction of the new airport at Enfidha. These impacts, including land acquisition and resettlement (being implemented by the Government) are being managed closely and in accordance to international best practice. The new airport has been planned since 1998 and the Government has conducted several public meetings regarding the proposed development.  The Monastir Airport has been in operation for 40 years; the terminal will undergo minor modification, including safety, security and waste management upgrades, as part of the project.  The Enfidha Airport is currently under construction and will meet international standards.  Based on the location of the village of Hergla and the presence of two Important Bird Areas (IBA) 13 km north and south of the Concession, the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development required the suppression of a second (originally planned) runway to eliminate low level flights (and their subsequent noise impact) over human populations and sensitive habitats.  No impacts on these IBAs are anticipated due to the project.  The Government has developed a Master Plan for this region of the country which includes development of a deep water Port, Tourism Zone and an Industrial Zone.  Consultations on the proposed plans have occurred over the past several years and the project is well known at the local and national level.  A Cumulative Environmental Assessment and a Groundwater Study for the Master Plan are currently underway.  The Enfidha Airport is not anticipated to have any negative impacts on surface or groundwater.  While the project does include Government managed and implemented land acquisition and a small amount of resettlement (20 houses), this process is being managed through a very well defined process as mandated by Tunisian law and consistent with IFC Performance Standards.  Titled landowners are being compensated at independently negotiated market rates and all households will be given titled land adjacent to the concession.  Tenancy and livelihoods are expected to be improved as part of this process as all families are being given titled plots adjacent to the Concession and will be compensated for structures and losses.  TAV has presented plans to address the impacts and other requirements, and will, upon implementation of specific agreed measures, comply with the IFC Performance Standards on Social and Environmental Sustainability.","","","","",26913,"","BD - Other Support Activities for Transportation (Grain Terminals, Cargo Terminals, Airport Operations)","","","",""

Petlas has traditionally focused on producing tires for tractors, heavy duty equipment and heavy commercial vehicles (HCV) and positioned itself as the clear leader in these segments in Turkey. Revenues from the passenger cars and light commercial vehicles (LCV) segments have historically been lower, the company continues focusing on commercial markets through the investment projects described below.Petlas revenues increased significantly thanks to the strong market presence and distribution network of AKO and the focus on export markets following the acquisition in March 2005. AKO is undertaking an investment program to expand its distribution network and modernize Petlas operation (altogether, the project). Strategically, AKO aims for Petlas to maintain its position in tires for tractors and heavy duty equipment, while playing an increasing role in the automotive tire sub-sector in the aftermarket.The project, estimated to cost around $188 million, includes the following components: Around $32 million investment to increase the capacity and modernize the operations of Petlas in automobile tire manufacturing.

Green Resources,Investment,Environmental Documents,Completed,Africa,Tanzania,Green Resources Limited,Regional Industry - MAS Africa,2008-03-14T04:00:00Z,"",B,Other,"Deforestation in Africa currently affects about 4 million hectares (ha) of land annually (55% of total global deforestation). Tanzania has lost 15% of its forest area since 1990, Uganda 25% and Mozambique 4%.  The three countries lose on average a combined area of 550,000 ha per year through harvesting for firewood and charcoal, burning and conversion to low-yield grazing and agricultural uses.  The impact of deforestation globally, through burning, is estimated to contribute 20% of the recent rise in CO2 in the atmosphere.  In addition, rural populations in Africa spend up to 50% of their day securing firewood from these rapidly diminishing forests. Green Resources AS (GRAS) is a plantation, forest products; renewable energy and carbon offset company with an active focus on addressing the damage created by deforestation in the East Africa region. The Company, which was established in 1995, is a private, profit oriented Norwegian company with 60 shareholders. It employs 2000 people and has invested more than $35 million in its African operations.  Green Resources has activities in Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique.GRAS is implementing an investment program over the next three years to expand and modernize its saw mill operations in Sao Hill, Tanzania, and establish additional plantations in Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique. The program will include:  - achieving internationally recognized certifications including FSC, CDM and ISO 14001/9001; - planting 9,000 ha of land with eucalyptus, pine, teak and indigenous trees; - expanding its equipment for harvesting and wood transportation; - modernizing an existing saw mill to increase efficiencies and capacity; - retrofitting a small wood waste to energy plant at the mill, and installing a new wood waste-fired Combined Heating and Power (CHP) facility; and-  associated miscellaneous capital expenditures. GRASs plantation and wood waste-to-energy projects will address the issues created by deforestation by:- increasing the amount of trees planted every year, thereby functioning as a carbon sink, - creating carbon offsets that will add to revenues, - generating electricity from fuels produced by sustainably managed forests,- providing a source of power poles for electric power distribution systems, and- generating significant employment in rural areas for some of the poorest people in the countries where it operates. Approximately one person is employed for every plantation hectare planted.  In addition, the increase in available electricity will decrease the demand for firewood, and will improve the living conditions of surrounding communities.Green Resources Limited (GRL) is the largest afforestation company in Africa.  GRL expects to plant 5,000 ha in 2008 and to increase to more than 10,000 ha/year by 2011. GRLs Tanzanian plantations have received 233,000 tons of Voluntary Emission Reductions (VERs), certified by SGS utilizing Kyoto and Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) criteria.  VERs were credited to the 1998-2005 period.  The credits can be sold at a market price in the web-based voluntary market.  GRL expects strong growth in annual offsets in the future but because of the negative effect of new planting during the first 2-3 years there may be little ongoing sequestration.  However, there will be strong growth in annual offsets thereafter.  GRL will also generate additional carbon offsets from its existing plantations in Uganda.Modification and expansion of the Sao Hill Industries Limited (SHI) sawmill will enable SHI to more fully utilize an existing government forest concession in Tanzania.  This concession consists of mature pine and eucalyptus forests, which are currently licensed by the Department of Natural Resources to SHI with a sustainable harvest of 250,000 m³/year.  The SHI sawmill is the largest in East Africa, producing utility poles and logs respectively from eucalyptus and pine trees. Renovation activities will include consolidation and expansion of pressure treatment for utility poles and sawn lumber as well as de-bottlenecking of existing operations.  SHI expects that the sawmill, within three years, will procure directly from GRLs own plantations at lower cost than from government plantations, and with a different mix of species available for sawn lumber production.  GRLs proposed new CHP biomass-fired power plant at SHI will ensure much greater reliability of power supply both to the sawmill and to local consumers, who frequently have erratic electric supply. The biomass-fired CHP plant will utilize sawmill wood waste to generate electricity and steam. The steam will be used for thermal processes such as dry kilns and a portion of the electricity generated will be used to operate the sawmill.  Excess electricity is to be sold to Tanzania Electric Supply Company (Tanesco) or to local industries nearby. The size of the biomass-fired CHP plant is still under review pending a fuel study and associated preliminary engineering.","","","","IFC staff visited GRASs offices in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and met staff responsible for certification programs in the plantations; reviewed the GIS system being developed for data tracking, management and utilization of all plantations resources;  conducted visits to sales yards where lumber products are marketed to the public; conducted a conference call with GRLs senior compliance manager in the Netherlands; and met with local ministries including Department of Forestry and Beekeeping, the Designated National Authority (DNA) for CDM Projects within the Ministry of Environment, and the Tanzanian Electric Supply Company Limited (Tanesco). And, IFC staff conducted a physical inspection of GRL plantations in the southern Tanzanian highlands and the Sao Hill (SHI) sawmilling company situated in the vicinity of government pine and eucalyptus plantations in Tanzanias southeastern highlands, and met with management staff for all field operations. The IFC team reviewed diverse company documentation including annual reports, business plans and the existing CHP audit and proposed reconstruction plan.","","","","","","","","","","","","The B categorization is applicable as there are no elements of the project with diverse, unprecedented negative environmental impacts.  There are issues to resolve in industrial lumber processing activities; and associated corrective measures are captured in an Environmental Action Plan.  In fact, the project has a number of positive impacts and will address issues created by deforestation by: - increasing the amount of trees planted every year, thereby functioning as a carbon sink, - creating carbon offsets that will add to revenues, - generating electricity from biomass processing waste, - providing a source of power poles for electrical distribution systems in Tanzania, Kenya Uganda and Mozambique, and -  generating significant employment in rural areas as approximately one person is employed for every hectare planted.

Calidra is increasingly targeting sectors such as glass making, water purification and treatment, thermal plants, and food and pharmaceutical industries, which can benefit from the greater use of lime but which in Mexico have historically used comparatively little lime.  Through a more efficient production of lime, several industries will benefit by having access to a higher quality product at competitive prices.","","","","","This is a Category B project, according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review procedures because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

Topic Tunisia,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Middle East and North Africa,Tunisia,TOPIC SA,Regional Industry - INF Africa,2008-03-21T04:00:00Z,2008-04-21T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"TOPIC, S.A. (TOPIC or the company) is a small Tunisian oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) company, with interest in three oil and gas blocks in Tunisia: - 100% interest in the offshore Halk el Menzel (HelM) concession block; - 15% interest in the onshore Jelma exploration block; and - 50% interest in the onshore Douleb West prospecting block.  The company is not currently producing from any of its blocks. IFC has been requested to provide a financing package to the company to partially fund TOPICs 2008-2011 investment program, which includes: - the development of an oil discovery in HelM; - acquisition of seismic data and drilling of exploration wells at HelM and TOPICs other blocks; and - further business development activities.","","","","","","- Fit with the World Bank Group Strategy: The World Banks most recent Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Tunisia, proposes to help the Government of Tunisia (GoT) address three challenges: - strengthen the business environment to support the development of a more competitive, internationally integrated private sector and improve competitiveness of the Tunisian economy; - enhance skills and employability of graduates and labor force in a knowledge economy; and - improve the quality of social services through increased efficiency of public expenditures.  IFCs strategy in Tunisia is to focus on where IFC can add value and foster private sector development especially in sectors currently not properly serviced by Tunisian commercial banks, including the oil and gas sector. The proposed IFC investment is therefore fully consistent with this strategy.- Development Impact:- Benefits to Government of TunisiaThe project is expected to provide GoT with considerable revenues from TOPICs operations in HelM, through the collection of a 10-15% royalty and a 50-75% profit tax (current estimate of about $133 million in revenues to GoT by end of 2012 under IFCs base case).  TOPIC will also have an obligation, as per Tunisias Hydrocarbon Code, to sell 20% of its oil production to the local Tunisian market at a 10% discount to international prices.- Direct and indirect local employment and training:The proposed project and continued growth of the company is expected to bring direct and indirect local employment and training.  It is estimated that the development of HelM alone will generate 200 direct and indirect jobs during construction and 100 during operations. All TOPICs staff are currently Tunisian and it is expected that at least 90% of direct and indirect jobs created will be local.- Local supplier linkages / community development:The proposed project is expected to benefit local communities by way of purchases of local goods and services.  For example, the construction of the production facility for HelM will be built at the port of Sfax, in Tunisia, and will require substantial inputs from local industrial and marine subcontractors.  Over 50% of Project capex is expected to be sourced locally.- Promoting local independent player:The project will support one of the very few locally-owned private sector North African upstream companies and help it grow and reach international best practice on environmental and social issues and corporate governance.","","Benefits from this project accrue from a variety of sources, including employment, supply linkages, and contributions to government revenues.  The projects revenue contributions to the GoT are a small share - less than 0.35% - of total government revenues.  The GoTs share of revenues accrues entirely to the central government. The GoT manages these revenues together with all other government revenues.  For 2008, GoT was expected to spend 38% of its budget on payment of salaries (mainly in administration, education, and healthcare sectors), 21% on development projects, and 23% on debt repayments.  According to Transparency International, Tunisia has a Corruption Perception Index of 4.2 and is ranked in the 61st position out of 180 countries graded in 2007.  In its assessment, IFC has considered the value of the Projects benefits, and governance and other risks to these benefits. IFC believes the risks to Project benefits not being realized, is relatively small. The non-revenue benefits which are significant, such as strengthening domestic energy production, generating jobs, purchases of local goods and services are unlikely to be impacted by weak governance. The Project is also consistent with overall World Bank Group objectives in the oil and gas sector; including helping to strengthen private sector participation in the sector.","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

Summit Oto Finance (SOF or the company), a motorcycle finance company based in Jakarta, Indonesia, and part of Sumitomo Corporation Group. The proposed investment is consistent with all aspects of IFCs strategy. It would represent a stable source of funding which would help SOF to:- expand its motorcycle financing activities to low income consumers, - diversify its funding base, and- reduce interest rate risks and better match its assets and liabilities.","","","","","","Strengthening the Micro and Small Business Sector: A large number of motorcycle owners use these as part of their SME/ micro businesses as an efficient mode of transportation to deliver goods and services. The project will facilitate the increase of motorcycle financing available to SME/micro businesses which is necessary to expand their operations.Deepening NBFI Sector:Indonesias financial sector is still heavily dominated by banks, which account for 80% of the financial sector assets. Indonesia needs to develop Non-Banking Financial Institutions (NBFI) sector, which can efficiently provide financing to consumers and SMEs by lowering operational costs and serving smaller customers than most banks target. Additionally, NBFIs can provide healthy competition to banks which will eventually further foster the development of the financial sector. The project will provide the company with long-term fixed rate financial resources for its growth. The support IFC provides to SOF will help it develop its own funding sources which can provide it with the ability to compete with the banking system on an ongoing basis and provide efficient, competitive financing to consumers.Create Significant Job Opportunities: The vast majority of motorcycles sold in Indonesia have a significant local value added component involving assembly within local factories as well as parts sourced from local suppliers. Not only does the project support job creation within the company, but also as the demand for motorcycles increases due to more availability of financing, the project will also indirectly support job creation along the value chain from local suppliers to distributors.","","","","",This project has been classified as a Category C project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

Cairn India II,Investment,Environmental Documents,Completed,South Asia,India,Cairn Energy Hydrocarbons Limited,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2008-03-31T04:00:00Z,"",A,Other,"Since 2004 Cairn India Limited and its subsidiaries (Cairn or the Company) have made a number of significant discoveries in its hydrocarbon block RJ-ON-90/1 in Rajasthan, northwest India (the Rajasthan Block). The proposed Project will consist of (i) the development of Cairns discoveries in Rajasthan Block including the construction of a crude oil processing facility; and (ii) the development of an approximately 600 km crude oil pipeline to transport oil from the Rajasthan Block to the western coast of India in Gujarat.In Rajasthan the pipeline passes through semi-arid to arid areas in which the physiography  is desert like, including sand dunes covered by sparse xerophytic vegetation. Agricultural practices mainly include extensive livestock production and limited rainfed crop production (mostly millets). Rainfall is seasonal (monsoons) and mean annual precipitation ranges between 200-500 mm. The settlement pattern consists largely of scattered households (dhanis) and small towns, and the pipeline has been sited to avoid resettlement of any households.In Gujarat mean annual precipitation is higher and ranges between 500-800mm, and consequently there is an improved range of vegetation cover. Most of the area is utilized for cropping (rainfed and irrigated) and a wide range of crops are grown, including millets, cereals, pulses, cotton, sugarcane and oilseed. Livestock production is more intensive in Gujarat, including dairy farming. The settlement pattern in the vicinity of the pipeline consists mainly of rural villages and small towns. The pipeline will mainly traverse agricultural and pastoral land, and some barren land, and does not pass through any settlements, and thus resettlement of any households has been avoided.Oil and Gas field developmentCairn has a 70% interest and operates the Rajasthan Block.  Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Indias state owned oil and gas company holds the remaining 30%.  The Rajasthan block is located within the districts of Barmer and Jalore.  The total current development area of the block is 3467 km2, and within the block the fields of Mangala, Bhagyam, Aishwariya, Saraswati, and Raageshwari form the core development area.  The Mangala, Bhagyam and Aishwariya fields are located in the northern part of the block, and the Saraswati, Raageshwari, and Raageswari gas fields are located in the central part of the block.As part of the drilling operation program, Cairn has drilled over 140 exploratory and appraisal wells in the various fields.  These wells may also be converted into production or injection wells.The development plan for the Mangala, Aishwariya and other southern fields includes drilling over 550 wells, which will comprise of production and injection wells. Based on the current estimate the production potential from these fields is over 135000 barrels of oil per day (bopd).  The Raageshwari gas field will be used in its entirety for captive power generation. In addition it is proposed to produce up to 40,000 bopd from the Bhagyam field, located approximately 17 km from the Mangala terminal. The Bhagyam field will be developed as a satellite to the Mangala field, and the well fluid will be  transferred by pipeline to be processed at the existing Mangala Processing Terminal (MPT). The development of the oil and gas fields envisions multi-well pads which will comprise many well heads at one location and the flow lines from each well head will be brought to a common manifold before flowing to the Central Processing Facility (CPF). The development of all the fields is expected to occur in close sequence commencing with the Mangala, Saraswati and Raageshwari fields followed by the Bhagyam and Aishwariya fields.  The Mangala field development plan will entail the drilling of development and injection wells, installation of a Central Processing Facility (CPF) called the Mangala Processing Terminal (MPT) including the Central Tank Farm (CTF), Interconnecting Pipeline Corridor, saline water treatment plant, captive power generation plant, waste management facilities.  The main CPF and CTF located in the MPT will be common to the Mangala and Aishwariya fields and will cater to the Bhagyam field. The interconnecting pipelines will connect the well pads and the processing facilities within the various fields.  Interconnecting pipelines will also be installed from the southern field to the northern field and a dedicated gas pipeline from the gas field in the south to the facilities in the north.  Additionally, there will be a natural gas pipeline to feed the captive power plant.  Interconnecting pipelines will be also installed from the saline water well field to the Mangala Processing Terminal (MPT) and the RO reject stream pipeline from the MPT to the injection field.  The length of the interconnecting pipelines is expected to be approximately 300 km.Mangala fieldThe Mangala field, based on current estimates, has the potential to produce approximately 125000 bopd.  The production process will consist of the well fluid being transported through buried pipelines located within the pipeline corridor connecting the well-pads to the MPT.  The produced water generated after well fluid processing at the MPT, will be transported to the produced water treatment plant located within the MPT for treatment.  After treatment and co-mingling with the de-salination plant reject stream it will be re-injected back into the reservoir through injection wells.  The associated gas generated will be treated for the removal of CO2, gas dehydration, compression and piped to the Captive Power Plant (CPP).  Bhagyam FieldThe Bhagyam field is located about 17-km from Mangala Process Terminal (MPT), and is planned to be developed as a satellite field and integrated into the MPT for processing, storage and export of the crude oil. The Bhagyam field development plan envisages setting up of 15 well pads across the Bhagyam field area and drilling up to a maximum of 81 wells. The current estimates indicate a potential for production of up to 40,000 bopd of crude oil.   Aishwariya fieldThe current Aishwariya development plan estimates a contribution up to 10000 bopd and will share the CPF and CTF with the Mangala fields.  It is expected that the Aishwariya field will have up to 8 well pads.Other FieldsThe smaller fields spread across the RJ-ON-80/1 block will essentially be developed as stand-alone production facilities. These fields are presently estimated to have a comparatively lower production potential. Raageswari Gas fieldThe Raageswari gas field will have up to two well pads, and the gas collection and processing facility will be located in the Raageswari oil well pad location.  The field is being developed to meet the fuel requirements of the Rajasthan field development. Oil Pipeline from Mangala Terminal in Barmer, Rajasthan to Salaya Terminal in Jamnagar, GujaratCairn in association with the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will build an onshore oil evacuation pipeline of approximately 600 km in length with associated facilities from Mangala terminal, located in Barmer, Rajasthan to Salaya terminal in Jamnagar, Gujarat.  The proposed pipeline development will incorporate the following components:Building of an approximately 600 km long 24 inches diameter insulated buried pipeline and an  8 inch diameter gas pipeline;Setting up of associated facilities including thirty two (32) heating stations with captive power generation facilities (approx. 1 MW) and four (4) pigging stations along the pipeline route;Establishment of storage, handling and pumping stations at two locations with captive power generation , namely Viramgam Terminal (8 MW) and Salaya Terminal (10 MW).","","","","The review of Cairn India II project consisted of an appraisal mission in January 2008, to the field development areas and the entire route of the oil pipeline.  However, the Project Sponsor is an existing IFC client, and previous supervision missions have been undertaken to assess implementation and compliance with Cairn Indias HSE and CSR management system.

Cairn India II,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,South Asia,India,Cairn Energy Hydrocarbons Limited,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2008-03-31T04:00:00Z,2008-05-30T04:00:00Z,A,Loan,"In 2004 Cairn India Limited and its subsidiaries (Cairn or the company) made a world-class discovery in its Rajasthan Block RJ-ON-90/1 in northwest India (the Rajasthan Block).   Cairn is currently focused on the development of the Rajasthan Block.The proposed project will consist of: - the development of Cairns discoveries in the Rajasthan Block including the construction of an oil processing facility; and, - the development of an approximately 600km crude oil pipeline to transport oil from the Rajasthan Block to Gujarats western coast.The development of discoveries in the Rajasthan Block was previously disclosed in connection with the debt facility IFC provided to Cairn in 2006. Since then, the company (as operator of the Rajasthan Block) has now taken on the responsibility to construct the pipeline.  Private investment and operation of the pipeline are seen by IFC as a positive step forward in the project, but requires additional financing.","","","","","","Fit with World Bank Groups Strategy:The proposed IFC investment is consistent with the WBGs strategic priorities in India.The current World Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for India focuses on improving government effectiveness; investing in people and empowering communities; and promoting private sector-led growth. The strategy for promoting private-sector led growth is further elaborated in the World Bank Groups Private Sector Development Strategy, appended to the CAS, which proposes that the World Bank and IFC work closely together to: - facilitate greater competitiveness;- improve the quantity and quality of infrastructure through greater private participation;- promote the provision of private health services; and - improve rural productivity and growth through greater private investment. IFC will focus on providing firms with long-term debt and equity which may not be available from domestic financial markets; and on adding value in the areas of global best practices, creating international partnerships, entering new markets, environmental and social sustainability and corporate governance. - Development Impact:Since the mid-1990s, India has implemented policy changes to encourage private investment in its upstream oil and gas sector. Although success remains modest, a number of foreign companies, such as Cairn, have successfully entered the sector. IFCs proposed investment reflects its continuing commitment to enhance the role of the private sector in the upstream hydrocarbons sector in India and help private companies meet the infrastructure challenges related to their activities. The proposed transaction will therefore build on the development impacts envisaged during our previous engagements with Cairn: - Development of Fuel Transportation Infrastructure:Cairns construction of an approximately 600 km crude oil transportation pipeline will help bring the fuel from the large Rajasthan discoveries to market hubs where it can be refined and further distributed to meet Indias growing energy demand. The potential use of this pipeline can later extend beyond Cairns Rajasthan Block to other blocks in Rajasthan where exploration activities are ongoing.- Enhancing Availability of Higher-Quality, Domestic Fuel:The Project is expected to reduce the reliance of Indias power sector and small industry on supplies of relatively inferior coal and more expensive naphtha, respectively. - Benefits to Government: It is expected that the governments of India will receive substantial fiscal receipts from royalties, production sharing and corporate taxes, generated by the oil production from the Project. A sizeable portion of these fiscal payments will accrue to the state government of Rajasthan in the form of royalties.- Import Substitution: At its currently projected production rate of more than 150,000 barrels per day, oil production from the Project would equate to approximately 18% of Indias indigenous oil production and 6% of Indias oil import volumes (both as of 2005/2006 fiscal year). - Creation and Preservation of Direct and Indirect Employment: The Project is expected to generate 450-500 jobs during peak operations (approximately 2,500 during the construction period), benefiting the local community through increased employment opportunities both directly and indirectly.  The Company encourages local hiring in its areas of operations to the extent possible.- Supporting Growth of an Indian Private Oil & Gas Company:Following Cairns discovery of oil in Rajasthan, Cairn took the decision to introduce local shareholding to its Indian operations.  The outcome was the creation of a publicly traded Indian company that has Indian ownership and Indian management.- Supporting Local Communities:  Cairn supports a wide range of community development activities in all its operations. Its work is concentrated in five main areas  health, education, local entrepreneurship development, environment and infrastructure  and benefits from effective co-ordination with local government, NGOs and media. Cairn is currently placing significant emphasis on meeting local community expectations for value-added employment opportunities, as well as further improvements of water infrastructure, medical services, health education, etc.  The key development indicators that are proposed to be monitored during the life of the IFC investment are:- annual production of hydrocarbons,- direct employment levels,- production sharing and fiscal payments accruing to the governments of Rajasthan and India, and- implementation of community development programs.","","An important benefit of the investments supported by the proposed financing is revenue flows to governments in the form of taxes, royalties and other payments, especially in the case of prospective oil projects in India. The World Bank has very active programs in India which is one of its largest borrowers and is generally seen, based on available indicators such as Transparency Internationals Corruption Perceptions Index and the World Bank Institutes Governance Indicators, as having adequate governance capacity.  Accountability for collection and use of revenues at the national level is not seen as a significant risk. The company has agreed to disclose publicly its payments to governments (including production sharing) at the state and national level.  On balance, given the governance context, the expected development impact and the projected benefits, including to communities and local government, IFC believes that this is a project which it should support.","","","The review of the project consisted of appraising technical, environmental and social information, appraising the operations of the company including the field development areas and the entire route of the proposed oil pipeline.

The total amount disbursed to-date is $50 million reaching over 38,000 borrowers of which 25% are female.  The outstanding portfolio, as of December 2007, stands at $10.9 million with Portfolio at Risk > 30 days at 1.11%.  Currently, AKAM's program offers a variety of loan products such as individual loans, group loans, education loans, health loans and home improvement loans.  The loans are extended in local currency averaging $876 equivalency and ranging between 3 to 24 months depending on their specific purpose.  The portfolio is spread across various sectors such as trade, services, and transportation (48%) and agriculture (40%) demonstrating its strong rural focus.

The program's assets and liabilities are expected to be consolidated into First Microfinance Bank (FMFB) Syria, following procedures established by the regulator. FMFB Syria will aim to stimulate income-generation in low-income areas and promote small-scale agricultural and industrial enterprises. It will provide credit and/or deposit products to support micro entrepreneurs, small-scale businesses, and rural development.","","","","","","This project is expected to have a high development impact in the following two main areas:
- Demonstration Effect:  

Consistent with the IFC's strategy, supporting the first microfinance bank to be established in Syria presents an excellent opportunity develop the sector.  Given the large unmet demand and the limited number of existing providers, it is likely that new entrants will replicate FMFB Syria's experience, thus demonstrating the viability of commercial microfinance in frontier markets.

- Access to finance for underserved segments:  

Over the next three years, the project is expected to provide over $100 million of financing to approximately 75,000 new borrowers, 26% of which are expected to be women.  As newer financial products are introduced, (savings, micro-insurance etc) more than solely credit needs of the clients will be serviced.  Additionally, the geographical spread is expected to widen as the Bank develops a nationwide network of outlets.

MDM Bank is the parent company and the lead operating entity of the MDM Group (the Group) accounting for 86% of the Groups assets.  The Group operates a total of two banks, one bank in the Russian Federation (MDM Bank, headquartered in Moscow) and one in Latvia (Latvian Trade Bank).  The Group also owns and operates securities trading and asset management companies and a leasing company. MDM was established in 1993.  Since then it evolved from being a mostly trading institution servicing its shareholders into a universal bank offering a full range of financial services to clients, including: corporate banking, retail banking, investment banking & financial markets, private banking and asset management.  Importantly, the Bank has a clear business model based on financial intermediation between non-related parties (as of 31 December 2007, on and off balance sheet exposure to related parties was approximately 0.1% of total assets).  In 2006 MDM Bank adopted a new strategy focused on expansion into retail and small business banking along with the development of regional branch network.  This strategy was updated in 2007 for the period 2008-2012 in response to changes in the competitive landscape and global financial markets and with input from the Banks new strategic minority shareholders, who joined during 2007.  While Corporate and Investment Banking remain the primary sources of revenue and are a core element of the Banks long-term business strategy, retail banking is one of the key strategic businesses for the Bank and the strongest value driver.  Small business banking was launched in late 2005 and today the Bank is a top six player in the sector by loan portfolio size.  In December 2007 MDM with the support from IFC launched a new energy efficiency loan product. The Bank is rated by international rating agencies, with BB rating from Standard & Poors, BB rating from Fitch Ratings, and Ba1/NP/D+ rating from Moodys.  The Bank is also the only Russian financial organization that has been given a public corporate governance rating by Standard & Poors.  In February 2008 Standard & Poors confirmed the overall Corporate Governance Score at 6+.  The rating comprises four components: - ownership structure and external influence; - shareholders rights and stakeholder relations; - transparency, disclosure and audit; and - board structure and effectiveness.","","","","","","This project represents an effort by IFC to strengthen and leverage an effective strategic relationship with MDM Bank in order to use its nation-wide distribution network to deliver energy efficiency financing to the Russian market.  In July 2007, MDM signed an Energy Efficiency Advisory Agreement with IFC and allocated $20 million from the previously provided IFCs $100 million credit line to energy efficiency loans specifically for SMEs.  In December 2007 the energy efficiency product was officially launched by the Bank and today energy efficiency financing is available for SMEs in 47 Russian cities.  IFCs A loan under this project is aimed at helping MDM Bank to expand its energy efficiency financing to this broader segment of businesses in Russia. Energy prices are increasing rapidly in Russia.  However, many industrial companies are still using energy-intensive equipment that was installed more than 20 years ago  nearly 48% of production assets in Russia date from before 1985.  Company managers take an overly conservative view when it comes to assessing energy efficiency potential.  Financial institutions, on the other side, are reluctant to finance energy efficiency loans due to the higher perceived risk and longer-term financing requirements.  IFCs investments complemented with dedicated technical assistance will enable the Bank to provide long-term energy efficiency loans at attractive rates.  Lower energy cost will improve companies cash flows and increase their competitiveness.  The increased modernization level of the companies will support a sustainable growth of the economy.  Also, the reduction in the energy consumption will translate into CO2 emission reduction while maintaining the same level of economic output, which in its course, will decrease the greenhouse effect and contribute to the slowing down of the climate change. A major Russian private bank with presence across the country, MDM has a significant influence on the stability of the Russian banking sector and economy overall.  The B Loan will help expand the access of MDM to the syndicated loan markets for larger amounts than is currently available and sustain the business expansion of the Bank.  The project is an important component of IFC''s response to the financing constraints faced by Russian banks as a result of the ongoing credit crunch in the international markets.","","","","","This project has been classified as a Category FI project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

One of the main development impacts of the project is the expected positive demonstration effect as the project will demonstrate the feasibility of electricity distribution sector privatization and increase the attractiveness to foreign investment in the MENA region.  The Jordanian electricity sector may set an example for other countries in the region that are considering embarking on the liberalization and privatization of their own power sectors. Another major positive impact for the Jordanian Government will be the privatization proceeds and the permanent transfer of the burden of investment in power distribution to the private sector.  This will enhance fiscal sustainability and enable GoJ to focus its scarce resources to other priority sectors.  Additional investments into better and more modern equipment as well the management of the distribution sub-sector by specialized private sector companies should also improve the quality of service to the end users in terms of availability, power quality as well as customer service.

Green Resources,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Africa,Tanzania,Green Resources Limited,Regional Industry - MAS Africa,2008-04-15T04:00:00Z,2008-05-20T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"Green Resources ASA (GRAS) is implementing an investment program over the next three years to expand and modernize its saw mill operations in Sao Hill, Tanzania, and establish additional plantations in Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique. The program will include:  - achieving internationally recognized certifications including FSC, CDM and ISO 14001/9001; - planting 9,000 ha of land with eucalyptus, pine, teak and indigenous trees; - expanding its equipment for harvesting and wood transportation;- modernizing an existing saw mill to increase efficiencies and capacity; - retrofitting a small wood waste to energy plant at the mill, and installing a new wood waste-fired Combined Heating and Power (CHP) facility; and- associated, miscellaneous capital expenditures. Deforestation in Africa currently affects about 4 million hectares (ha) of land annually (55% of total global deforestation). Tanzania has lost 15% of its forest area since 1990, Uganda 25% and Mozambique 4%.  The three countries lose on average a combined area of 550,000 ha per year through harvesting for firewood and charcoal, burning and conversion to low-yield grazing and agricultural uses.  The impact of deforestation globally, through burning, is estimated to contribute 20% of the recent rise in CO2 in the atmosphere.  In addition, rural populations in Africa spend up to 50% of their day securing firewood from these rapidly diminishing forests. GRASs plantation and wood waste-to-energy projects will address the issues created by deforestation by: - increasing the amount of trees planted every year, thereby functioning as a carbon sink,- creating carbon offsets that will add to revenues,- generating electricity from fuels produced by sustainably managed forests,- providing a source of power poles for electric power distribution systems, and- generating significant employment in rural areas for some of the poorest people in the countries where it operates. Approximately one person is employed for every plantation hectare planted.  In addition, the increase in available electricity will decrease the demand for firewood, and will improve the living conditions of surrounding communities.Sao Hill Industries Limited (SHI) and Green Resources Limited (GRL) are wholly owned by GRAS. GRL it is one of the largest afforestation companies in Africa.  GRL planted 3,000 ha in 2007, expects to plant 5,000 ha in 2008 and to increase to more than 10,000 ha/year by 2011.  Modification and expansion of the Sao Hill Industries Limited sawmill will enable SHI to more fully utilize an existing government forest concession in Tanzania.  This concession consists of mature pine and eucalyptus forests, which are currently licensed by the Department of Natural Resources to SHI with a sustainable harvest of 150,000 m³/year, or ¼ of the annual allowable cut of the entire Sao Hill Forest Project (SHFP), and procure currently unutilized waste and thinning from the remaining ¾ of the harvested wood from SHFP.  The project will furthermore enable SHI to process wood harvested from GRL and other private forests.  The SHI sawmill is the largest in East Africa, producing utility poles and construction timber respectively from eucalyptus and pine trees. Renovation activities will include consolidation and expansion of pressure treatment for utility poles and sawn lumber as well as de-bottlenecking of existing operations.    The proposed new CHP biomass-fired power plant at SHI will ensure much greater reliability of power supply both to the sawmill and to local consumers, who frequently have erratic electric supply. The plant will utilize sawmill wood waste to generate electricity and steam. The steam will be used for thermal processes such as dry kilns and a portion of the electricity generated will be used to operate the sawmill.  Excess electricity is to be sold to Tanzania Electric Supply Company (Tanesco) or to local industries nearby. The size of the biomass-fired CHP plant is still under review pending a fuel study and associated preliminary engineering.","","","","","","The project is expected to help sustainably address strong demand for timber and poles, given the growing regional demand for housing and for rural electrification in Africa. The project will help the GRAS expand its capacity and efficiency of its operations as a result of renovation of the existing saw mill with new and better technology. This in turn will allow the company better utilize its raw materials and save energy while achieving better economies of scale.  This is expected to improve GRs profitability and benefit consumers from the widening product range to include higher quality lumber, and value added products.  The project will also help save energy as the new CHP plant is based on recycled and renewable feedstock where the amount of electricity produced per unit of input is expected to double.  In addition, the project will create significant job opportunities to the local community. The company, along with Unilevers tea processing, are the two largest employers in the region, and the inhabitants rely very much on the seasonal employment created during harvest period.  This in turn expected to slowdown rural migration as it provides job opportunities to the local population. Given lack of adequate electric supply in the area, the company has plans to generate its own electrical power where 80% of the capacity is expected to be sold to the community through the local power authority.","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

Its target industries will span the agricultural value chain, ranging from contract farming at the primary end and key elements of the agricultural supply chain (e.g. cold storage chains) to food processing and rural retail, with expected deal sizes of $3-10 million per transaction. The agribusiness sector in India is currently marked by several small to medium companies of which few have made the transition to global scale and competitiveness. IAF's specialized sector focus and expertise is expected to aid and improve the scalability, operational efficiency and strategic and business development initiatives of these companies. The fund will seek significant minority stakes with investor rights and active board participation.","","","","","","Agribusiness is an identified priority area for the India region for IFC direct and funds investments. Notwithstanding strong and robust growth in the services and manufacturing sectors in the last two decades, the Indian economy is still dominated by agriculture, which also employs a majority of the population in rural areas. However, growth in the agricultural sector has significantly lagged that in other sectors, thereby not only dragging down the overall growth rate but also widening income and social inequalities. Investments in modernizing the agricultural economy are urgently needed and will have a direct impact on reducing poverty. 

The Fund is expected to have a strong development impact as a result of its focus on value-added investing in the Agri-business sector in mid-market companies and SMEs. It is expected to reach companies that IFC would otherwise find difficult to access - many of the investee companies will be located in non-metro locations, and fall below the revenue threshold for IFC direct investments. The Fund Manager's strategy is take an active role in the management of mid-sized companies in the agribusiness space,  including corporate governance improvement through board participation, strategy setting, helping professionalize management, and improving financial and operational performance. The growth and the success of the investee companies will have positive benefits for their financiers, their employees' skills and livelihood as well as on economic opportunities for suppliers of goods and services.","","","","","This project has been classified as a Category FI project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

Ltd (Midas or company) is a Chennai-based Indian telecommunications equipment company which designs affordable and appropriate telecom access solutions for both urban and rural areas in emerging markets.   The companys flagship product is BroadbandcorDECT, which is based on the European Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) standard. The company is also about to deploy a GSM access solution that is specifically designed for high modularity, low power, high reliability and low subscriber densities. It is also developing a 4G voice and data platform based on the IEEE 802.16e standard (Wimax-e) that will have applications for both urban and rural voice & broadband data requirements.  The company also offers some wireline products, namely Ethernet switches and ADSL and Ethernet access systems that connect the backhaul to residential and corporate buildings. The company was founded in 1994 by a group of alumni of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IITM) to develop and commercialize data and voice last mile access solutions for India and other emerging markets. The founders include Rene Abraham, who is the Chief Technology Officer, and Shirish Purohit, who is currently the Chief Executive Officer and the head of Marketing and Sales. Both Mr. Abraham and Mr. Purohit have more than 20 years of experience in the telecommunication electronics industry. Midas focuses on product design and deployment and outsources its manufacturing to world-class contract electronic manufacturers. This allows the company to scale up or down its manufacturing as required, in order to meet customer demand and avoiding high capital expenditures.Midas is seeking $24.5 million in equity funding to scale up its operations by:- continuing to develop its family of access corDECT products while targeting new clients in other low-income, low tele-density countries; - expanding market reach through increased sales & marketing efforts; - deepening existing customer relationships; and - continuing R&D on new promising technologies","","","","","","The project is expected to achieve the following development impacts:- Benefit Consumers in Rural areas: The ultimate beneficiary of Midas technologies will be the end-user in emerging and rural markets whose current access options are either prohibitively expensive or entirely absent. The end-user will benefit by having access to reliable broadband data and voice service at better qualities and lower costs leading to further economic development in rural areas. Increased access to telecommunication will indirectly contribute to economic growth; a recent McKinsey study cites that a 10% increase in tele-density contributes to 0.6% of GDP growth.- Expand Access to Telecoms in emerging markets, including rural areas: Existing telecom access solutions have substantial infrastructure requirements. Such infrastructure is typically available in high tele-density urban and semi-urban markets but is difficult to extend to low tele-density rural markets with poor infrastructure. Traditional telecom networks have only incidentally benefited villages in the periphery of well-connected urban centers and major transportation lines. Rural teledensity in India currently stands at 8% as compared with approximately 60% in urban areas.  The Indian government aims to provide mobile phone access to an additional 270 million people, and to expand the geographical coverage by 20%. Midas low-cost telecom solutions are specifically designed to meet the needs of rural populations, and fit well with the governments plans to increase rural teledensity in India.   - Support an Indian IT product company that is developing core intellectual property: The Indian IT industry contributes more than 4% to GDP and accounts for more than 20% of exports, yet the Indian IT market is primarily comprised of services companies. India regularly produces world-class engineers but this talent has typically immigrated to the United States to find challenging work.  An investment in Midas would support and demonstrate the ability to product promising, world class technology companies in India. - Support a company located in a region has not seen significant private equity/venture stage investment: Most IT investments are focused on companies based in Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai or Delhi.  Companies outside these traditional IT investment hubs tend to have a difficult time raising capital.  An investment from IFC would benefit a company that is not located in this corridor and should spur more private equity/venture stage investor interest in Chennai.","","","","","On May 22, 2008 this SPI was revised to reflect the completion of environmental and social appraisal of the project.

The project also includes a captive 18 MW gas fired power plant which is operational and providing power to the national grid. The project would source steel, mainly hot rolled coil, in the competitive world steel market and process it further to make cold rolled coils and galvanized sheets primarily for roofing material. The project cost is estimated at $162 million, including $34 million working capital. - Purpose of Project: The project would establish the first privately owned galvanizing sheet plant in Pakistan that would domestically manufacture and substitute 75% of the galvanized sheet that is currently imported.  Pakistan imports 200,000 tpa annually or 80% of its requirements.  The imports of galvanized sheet into Pakistan are primarily made by individual traders in small quantities which is inefficient and leads to high costs to domestic consumers.  The projects large and modern manufacturing equipment will lead to lower costs to consumers, allow better matching of the market needs through customized products and achieve significant proximity advantage against imports through shorter lead times.","","","","","","The project will have a strong development impact by locally supplying galvanized sheets that are currently imported, savings over $35 million annually of foreign exchange.  Many houses in the coastal regions of Pakistan still use asbestos sheets for roofing, which represents health issues for the society, and which the project plans to replace with galvanized sheets. The project will benefit from the management expertise of a strong sponsor, who has significant technological know-how both in investment and production.  It will also create direct job opportunities, for about 500 employees, who will benefit training schemes.

The rehabilitation will re-commission the Ambuklao plant, which has been shut down due to silt problems, upgrade the Binga plant, and increase the combined capacity by 50 MW in total (30 MW for Ambuklao and 20 MW for Binga) from 175 MW to 225 MW.  They will operate as peaking plants, supplying power to the Luzon grid for about five hours daily.  There are no electric transmission system constraints with regard to the expected higher generation levels.The project company, SNAPB, is expected to take over the hydropower facilities in June 2008, and will put in place new management procedures, address technical issues such as sedimentation and dam safety and implement the rehabilitation of both plants.  SNAPB will also enter into a separate agreement with the Government, for those facilities that will remain under public ownership, to cover the operation and maintenance of the dams and appurtenant structures, formulation of operations manuals, formation of an oversight committee, and maintaining the integrity of the water levels in the reservoirs.  Responsibility for the watershed management will remain with the Government.Ambuklao and Binga are located on the Agno River in Benguet Province, in a relatively narrow, steep sided valley.  Ambuklao dam was built in 1956, and is of rockfill construction with an impervious central core, maximum height of 129 m, a crest length of 452 m, and a reservoir area of 7.5 km2.  The plant was decommissioned in 1999 as a result of accelerated silt accumulation around the water intake point.  As part of the rehabilitation, SNAPB will construct another intake point at a higher elevation.  The rehabilitation plan will also include installation of new electrical and mechanical equipment and a new tailrace discharge structure at a higher elevation to address silting.  The Ambuklao dam will also need some repair works in relation to erosion and damage to the embankment, repairs to gates, and general maintenance.  Rehabilitation is to take two years and is targeted for completion in July 2010.Binga was built downstream of Ambuklao in 1960, and is also of rockfill construction, maximum height of 107 m, a crest length of 400 m, and a 4.26 km2 reservoir area.  Binga will be upgraded with the construction of a new intake and the replacement of each generation unit per year during dry season when all units are not needed.  Plant rehabilitation will include construction of a new intake similar to Ambuklao as well as installation of new electrical and mechanical equipment.  The Binga dam will need some repair works in relation to damage to the embankment, a deficiency in spillway capacity, and other maintenance and repairs.  Completion of the refurbishment plan targeted for the first half of 2013.As Ambuklao is upstream to Binga the Ambuklao reservoir supplements the reservoir for Binga as well allowing for the operation of the two power plants in cascade.  This will be important in the future, as sedimentation progress is expected to lead to a run of river situation at Binga by 2027.  SNAPB does not plan on desilting the reservoir and will instead operate the plant in a manner that will regularly remove silt from the areas immediately in front of the intake.Being a refurbishment of an existing renewable energy project, it is well aligned with IFCs Climate Change Strategy.  Electricity from Ambuklao and Binga is sold to the Luzon grid, one of the three major island grids in the Philippines.  Luzon grid is predominantly thermal-based, which accounts for 70% of electricity generated, while hydro and geothermal account for the remaining 20% and 10% respectively.  The refurbished project will generate an estimated 755 GWh for 2010 onwards, and annually avoid greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to an estimated 550,000 tons of CO2 from displaced thermal generation.","","","","The Ambuklao and Binga hydroelectric power plants are being privatized as a package through an international tender process, as part of the privatization program under a comprehensive sector reform law, the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA).  At privatization, expected to occur in June 2008, the plants will be owned by SN Aboitiz Power Benguet, Inc. (SNAPB), a joint-venture between SN Power Invest (SN Power) of Norway and Aboitiz Equity Venture (AEV) of the Philippines.  IFCs proposed investment, a loan, will be in parallel with additional financing from Nordic Investment Bank and local banks and will support the privatization.IFC, on behalf of the Lenders, engaged SKM Consulting of New Zealand to conduct a technical and environmental review of the existing operations at Ambuklao and Binga, assess SNAPBs plans for takeover, and work with SNAPB to develop a social and environmental Action Plan for Ambuklao and Binga to meet IFCs Performance Standards within a reasonable timetable.  SKM conducted visits and interviews at the project sites in March 2008, together with investment and technical staff from IFC.SKMs April 2008 draft report was the primary basis for IFCs staff review of the project. IFC staff also reviewed other documents, including various environmental due diligence reports prepared for SNAPB by the Manila, Philippines office of GHD Pty Ltd, preliminary dam safety audits undertaken for SNAPB by Tonkin & Taylor International Ltd. with Engineering Development Corporation of the Philippines, and the Information Memorandum for the project.","","","","","","","","","","","","IFC''s review of this investment identified the following issues: - environmental and social management capacity of the project company, SNAPB, and the expected technical support from the sponsors;- environmental liabilities from past operations, and planned corrective actions;- reservoir sedimentation;- environmental upgrade plan;- dam and reservoir safety;- watershed management planning; and - community engagement.  Communities of Indigenous Peoples predominate in, and derive livelihoods from natural resources, in the reservoir and watershed areas.  As such, IFC considered their current livelihood patterns, the status of any ongoing programs of engagement and community development between them and SNAPB, and potential adverse effects on these communities from construction activities and changes to reservoir operation and maintenance.IFC also considered the performance of the project sponsors, SN Power and AEV, on a similar project in northern Luzon (Magat HEPP) financed by IFC in 2007 in addressing environmental, health, safety and social issues in a responsible manner satisfactory to IFC.Actions planned or in negotiation related to the Ambuklao and Binga projects are expected to provide a means for SNAPB to be compliant with IFCs Performance Standards within a reasonable timetable.  None of the identified issues are expected to result in significant impacts, and, as such, this is a Category B project according to IFCs Environment and Social Review Procedure because potential environmental or social impacts attributable to the private project are limited.","","","","",26996,"",BA - Large Hydro - Renewable Energy Generation,"","","",""

It will be owned and operated by International Industries Ltd..","","","","The review of this project consisted of appraising technical, environmental and social information submitted by the project sponsor including a review of: - the business plan for the proposed plant, including site maps, plans and engineering designs; - the Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) report prepared for submission to the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency, - list of staff responsible for Q&E & and OHS Management System and their qualifications, - organogram of concerned personnel, - corporate social responsibility activities, - Manual for Quality and Environmental Management System, - Manual for Occupational Health and Safety Management System, - Personnel Manual and recruitment procedure, - Procedure for Environmental Aspect & Impact assessment, - Procedure for Emergency Preparedness & Response, - Procedure for Consultation and Communication, - Procedure for Supplier & Contractor Management, - Procedure for Use of Personal Protective Equipment, - Current Status of Objectives (LTAFR  OHSAS), - Current Status of Objectives (Environment), - recent generator testing reports, - current steps taken for Continual Improvement, - employee participation in HSE MS System, and Lloyds Auditor reports for QMS (ISO9001:2000), - EMS (ISO 14001) and OHSAS (ISO 18001).  In addition, IFC met with the project team at IILs existing plant in Karachi, and visited the project site, located approximately 2km from the existing plant.","","","","","","","","","","","","The project involves development of a single integrated Cold Rolled Coil and Galvanized Sheet plant in a heavily modified peri-urban mixed use (light industrial and some residential) area of Karachi.  Key environmental, health and safety and social aspects of the project include:- management of environmental, health and safety performance at current and planned operations; - social and environmental assessment of the impacts of the project; - compliance with the national and local permitting requirements, ability to engage with local communities; - fair, safe and healthy working conditions in the operation of sponsors facilities and construction of the project; - use of water and energy; - air emissions from the process and from the power plant, including greenhouse gas emissions, solid waste and by-products management, process wastewater management; and - noise; - possible impacts on ambient water and air quality, including noise; - effects of traffic and labor influx generated by the project; - impacts associated with land acquisition; and - possible impacts of construction on cultural heritage.The approximately 32.4 acre site was formerly state land.  It was given to the owners by the Military Estate in exchange for their land used by the government through the 1940s and 50s. The sponsor purchased the entire landholding from a single owner in 2007, on a willing-buyer, willing seller basis.  The transaction did not result in any physical or economic resettlement. Given the current land use of the site and surrounding area, no adverse impacts on environmentally sensitive areas or indigenous peoples are expected to occur. The nature of the companys operations is such that it will be possible to readily design and implement engineering and management measures to mitigate any adverse impacts that result from the project. Moreover, in light of the fact that mitigation measures can readily be designed, adverse impacts are not expected to be diverse or irreversible and will be limited to project site, and no physical or economic displacement of communities occurred, the project has been classified as a Category B.","","","","",26753,"","AF - Other Steel Products (Including Wire, Metal Sheets etc.)","","","",""

Salamander projects that the project will help it to increase its production more than twofold  to reach over 16,000 boe per day by 2010.","","","","","","Fit with World Bank Group (WBG) Strategy In Thailand, the World Banks role has evolved from lending towards facilitating knowledge sharing and providing policy advice. Within this broad framework, IFC seeks to provide long-term finance and risk management products for increased investment in infrastructure, as well as support viable projects in key growth sectors. In Indonesia, WBG assistance aims at public sector reform, disaster risk management, increased financing for poverty alleviation, and stronger partnerships to improve the business environment and infrastructure development. IFCs proposed engagement with a smaller regional company in the upstream oil and gas sector investment is therefore aligned with strategic objectives for the WBG engagement in Indonesia and Thailand.Development Impact:- Enhanced Availability of a Cleaner Fuel:  The Project will support the development of natural gas reserves, in line with WBG commitments following the EIR. The increased availability of natural gas will promote the use of a cleaner fuel (given that natural gas has much lower carbon emissions than coal which is frequently the alternative fuel for power generation in Southeast Asia). - Preservation and Creation of Employment: The Project will have a sustaining impact on existing employment levels in producing assets and will contribute to the creation of new jobs in assets about to enter into production. For example, - the ONWJ and SES assets currently provide more than 1,400 permanent jobs and over 1,000 temporary/construction jobs, and - the bringing into production of the Kambuna and Bualuang assets is expected to generate an additional 150 permanent jobs. Salamander staff positions are generally remunerated at a 25%-30% premium to other comparable employment. The percentage of nationals in managerial positions tends to be high, mostly above 75%.   Contribution to Central and Local Government Revenues: The project will generate significant fiscal receipts from a combination of royalties (12.5%), corporate taxes (41.5%-50.0%), production sharing (42% to 71%) and obligations to supply domestic consumers at below-market prices. A material portion of these  approximately 15% of royalties in Thailand and 15-30% of total government payments in Indonesia  is expected to ultimately accrue to the regions where the oil and gas activities are undertaken. Generating Additional Business for Local and National Suppliers: The project is expected to have a positive impact on national and regional economic activity through the purchasing of equipment, products and services. For example, in 2008 contracts worth more than $45 million are expected to be sourced from regional and national suppliers in Indonesia and Thailand.Promoting Competition and Attracting FDI in Frontier Countries: The project promotes competition in the oil and gas sector through the growth of one of very few independent E&P companies exclusively focused on Southeast Asia. The participation of smaller privately-owned companies is important to the industry, as they - often focus on reserves deemed too small to be of interest to the majors and the national oil companies which dominate the sector in Southeast Asia, and - deliver production and recovery rates which tend to be above industry averages. In addition, if the company is successful in its exploration efforts in frontier/IDA countries such as Vietnam and Lao, the project will help demonstrate the viability of investment by small independents in their upstream sectors.","","It is expected that benefits from the project will accrue to different levels of government in Indonesia and Thailand in the form of royalties and taxes. In evaluating this project, IFC took into consideration the value of the projects benefits and governance and other risks to these benefits. In particular, it utilized a range of governance assessment methodologies, including but not limited to Transparency Internationals Corruption Perceptions Index and the World Bank Institutes Governance Indicators, as well as the current relationship between Indonesia/Thailand and the WBG. For the past several years, the WBG has been partnering with Thai public and private institutions on a range of important developmental challenges, including governance and public sector reform. In Indonesia, governance concerns have been a major driver of the WBG country strategy. To support reforms in local governance, the World Bank has established a multi-donor Decentralization Support Facility. On balance, given the governance context, the expected development impact and the projected benefits, IFC believes that this is a project which it should support.","","","The project is a Category B project according to IFCs Policy for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because it has limited adverse social or environmental impacts that are few in number, are site specific and will largely be reversible and readily addressed through mitigation measures.

IFC''s work in Tajikistan is an example of how the investment and advisory programs work together to build an enabling regulatory environment for microfinance and to create a new, best practice institution with the ability to demonstrate sustainable delivery of financial services to the micro and small segments of the market.Commercialization of Industry:  IFCs main role lies in facilitating the process of commercialization of the industry.  Commercialization enables MFIs to better leverage their equity, increasing their ability to serve significantly more clients, and offer them a wider range of financial products and services.  The Project will also allow IFC to further develop and nurture a diversified network of investment partnerships and promote commercial microfinance by creating a demonstration and replication effect through the endorsement of microfinance as an attractive and profitable new asset class to commercial individual and institutional investors.  Furthermore, IFCs commitment to AMHs network investments is likely to be a strong catalyst to attracting other international financial institutions as investors.","","","","","The project involves IFC support for the business of microfinance and has been classified as a Category FI project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

By shipping and trading cement between countries with cement production surpluses (and low prices) and countries facing shortages (and high prices), the Group allows both sides to benefit and enhances the efficiency of the global cement market.  The project will facilitate cement exports from countries with excess supply (like Pakistan, China and India) to countries where there is a shortage of cement production capacity (like the US and the Middle East).  Therefore, both the cement industry in exporting countries and the construction industry in importing countries would benefit from the Project.

The company will leverage on the sponsor's existing trading operation to supply its products to the US and European markets.","","","","","","- Supporting the modernization of the textile section: 

The proposed project will contribute to Egypt's effort in transitioning from a supplier of raw material to an international textile manufacturing center. The textile sector in Egypt is majority controlled by state owned companies which are poorly managed with outdated technologies. The project will transfer management expertise, technological know-how, and a proven quality control system to Egypt and help support the modernization of the sector.  

- Domestic value addition:

Currently, Egypt exports the majority of its production of cotton. The project will add value to this raw material through further processing, thus increasing government tax revenue and contributing to export earnings for Egypt. In addition, the project will enhance the skills of the local workforce through training and management and technology transfer.

- Employment generation: 

Egypt's main economic challenge is to generate enough jobs to absorb its large and growing labor force. By creating around 2400 jobs in Menoufia, Egypt's most populated governorate where the plant will be located, the project will help address Egypt's unemployment problems, especially outside of the capital. 

- Setting environment and social standards:

The project will help set high standard for environment, social, safety and labor practices in the country's textile manufacturing industry in which these aspects in the global supply chain are increasingly scrutinized by the customers.

Key development impacts of the project that will be tracked during supervision include the following:
- Benefits to the local economy, to be measured by local purchases of raw materials, energy and other services;

- Benefits to the employees, to be measured by the number of direct jobs created, wages, and training costs;

- Modernization of the textile sector, to be measured by the transfer to new technology and production skills and techniques;

- Setting environment and social standards, to be measured by compliance with the WBG Environment, Social, Health, and Safety standards.

In addition, the following key financial and economic performance indicators will be tracked during supervision:

- Financial performance: The company's sales, net income, return on invested capital;  and
- Economic performance: Operating income, economic return on invested capital, and taxes paid to the government.","","","","","The key environmental and social issues associated with this project are social and environmental assessment, management of social and environmental issues in operation, labor and working conditions, emissions to air and water, and efficient use of energy and water.These issues are may all be readily mitigated by the application of readily available techniques and technology, are site specific and are reversible.

Mixta Africas two business areas are: - the development of housing projects; and, - land transformation projects, with an exclusive African focus. (In addition, the current land transactions in Senegal have required Mixta to commit to hotel development although this is not their core business). The land transformation projects involve acquiring land plots, undertaking legal transformations and physical improvements and selling them to others for housing, business construction or other activities. All development of land and housing occurs through local construction companies. The business model requires the establishment of a subsidiary in each selected country whereupon land identification, evaluation and acquisition, and subsequently, project design, development and implementation, occur. Initially MA starts with pilot projects to accurately assess cost and demand prior to making longer-term commitments. Mixta Africa has focussed on Morocco and Senegal. Mixta Morocco has completed its pilot phase and is now managed as consolidated business while Senegal remains in emerging market categorisation subject to completion of the pilot project.

A presence of a strong and competent logistics operator in Vietnam would support the growing seafood industry and allow Vietnam to target more quality-oriented markets, benefiting both local economy and consumers. It will also help to promote better standards among other cold storage providers competing in this market that will in turn facilitate the integration of Vietnam to the WTO.

Through its support to boosting tourism, air transport also contributes though indirectly but to a great extent to reduce poverty by generating economic growth, providing employment opportunities (tourism accounts for more than 300,000 jobs in Nepal), earn foreign currency reserves and increasing tax collection. - Safe, reliable and efficient transportation services to underdeveloped areas: Being a mainly mountainous country, air travel is important to economic development as well as emergency and essential services to isolated regions of the country with either none or limited road access.  BAPL provides essential air transportation services in Nepal, where traveling by road or rail transportation is inconvenient, time consuming and at times impractical in light of the quality of the countrys land-based transport infrastructure and the distances between the countrys urban centers.. - Investment Enabler: Air transport is an enabler of investment both into and out of countries and regions: viable air transport links are one of the key considerations that influence where international companies choose to invest. Improved air transport links by way of improved connectivity between cities, expand the market in which companies operate.

Water will be diverted from Longtou dam through a 5.6 km long tunnel to a power house located on the Tongxi River, just downstream of Tangcun town.  The project will take advantage of the much higher head available through this configuration.  Diversion of water to Tangcun will reduce the power that can be generated by the three Yungang plants; however, overall power output will be substantially increased.  A 30 km transmission line will evacuate power from the plant.  These will have moderate impacts typical of civil works construction.  Part II is an equity investment, for which the funds will be used for construction of relatively small hydroelectric power plants.

Avianca has five code sharing agreements with international carriers (Iberia, Mexicana, Delta, Air Canada and Taca). 

Avianca is planning to renew its fleet over the period 2008-2012 to reduce costs, improve efficiency and safety as well as provide better passenger service. The company has negotiated the purchase of 42 aircraft over the next 5 years (including at least 12 Boeing-787s and a number of Airbus-319/320/330s) to replace its MD-83 and Boeing-757/767 aircraft.

The project site is located in the Kaliakra Peninsula in the Via Pontica migration corridor.  This corridor, which is 50 km wide measured from the Black Sea coast inland, is a major flyway of European significance due to the diversity and volume of migrating birds, particularly large soaring birds, which pass through in large numbers during annual autumn and spring migrations.  Impacts on birds relate primarily to projected incremental mortality rates the project potentially poses and the cumulative impacts of wind development in the project area on mortality and the migration corridor. The project entails no involuntary resettlement or economic displacement.  All land that the project is located on was formerly agricultural land and was purchased commencing in 2003 by Geopower at market rates on a willing seller basis.  Land for the T-line right of way (ROW) is also located on private land.  Leases, for the T-line tower footprints, will be negotiated with landowners based on a willing market transaction.","","","","",26836,"",BC - Wind Power - Renewable Energy Generation,"","","",""

The primary objective of the project is to increase access to finance for Argentina's agricultural sector players, with an emphasis on reaching rural areas where much of Argentina's agriculture is concentrated.  This will be achieved by leveraging BP's strong position in agriculture finance and distribution capacity in those areas.","","","","","","- Enhance access to finance for agricultural SMEs and farmers: 

The project will allow BP to provide its agribusiness-related client base access to funding with longer maturities both in pesos and US$ (reaching the whole spectrum of viable small and medium ventures) and enabling these to undertake capital investments at longer tenors and attractive costs.

- Contribute to build a long term peso curve: 

Through this financing, IFC will inject local currency liquidity in a market where bank to bank lending is practically non existent and where long term financing available is usually up to five years. Therefore, the project is intended to address an important constraint to growth for the target segments, as banks are not currently able to offer medium- or long-term term lending, given the short-term nature of their funding. 

- Generate positive demonstration effect: 

 The proposed project will create a demonstration effect for other banks and thus further enhance IFC's developmental impact and additionality in Argentina's agricultural sector.","","","","","This project has been classified as a Category FI project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

For the SME sector, data centers allows for young businesses to have access to professional grade technology platforms and reliable, consistent Internet connectivity without the burden of significant upfront capital expenditure on equipment and the ongoing high costs of recruiting specialist IT staff.  Regional Expansion:   BAC plans to open new offices and acquire mid-size IT companies in frontier regions that have inadequate IT services capacity.   The companys move to these regions would support existing clients that are expanding business to those regions, in turn, increasing economic activity.Employment and skills training: Over the next four years, BAC plans would create several hundred new engineering jobs.

In November 2007, the sponsors acquired approximately 3,000 ha of land in the hurricane-affected forest from private land owners and began salvage logging operations on site in March 2008. In addition to this property, the sponsors have identified additional land in the RAAN comprising 8,000 to 9,000 ha of forest destroyed by the hurricane, the acquisition of which will give the company economies of scale.  The tropical hardwoods harvested from these lands will be processed into FSC-certified decking, flooring, doors, furniture, dimensional and structural lumber, and sold on both the domestic and international markets.  Concurrent with the salvage operations, the company plans to replant select areas native hardwood species common to the region while setting aside areas for natural re-growth.  Reforestation and FSC certification are fundamental principles of the project.  Reforestation will ensure the return of forest cover on the property and any other properties involved in the project, as well as ensuring a consistent and sustainable supply of wood for the Groups sawing and milling operations in the future.

Increasing the supply of legally harvested wood will also encourage development of Nicaraguas downstream capacity in the furniture and other wood processing industries. In addition, the project could serve as a model for private and public involvement in sustainable development of the hurricane affected lands.  Job Creation:The project will create 400 additional permanent jobs. Most of the employment opportunities are expected to be in RAAN, where the unemployment rate is higher than in the rest of the country. The project will also continue to support indirect employment through outsourcing of the companys trucking and furniture manufacturing to independent small businesses that employ an aggregate of 100 people.  Positive Impact on Climate Change:The project will have a significant impact on global climate change.  Processing the downed trees into lumber will achieve the carbon sequestration for the life of the manufactured products, as opposed to leaving the trees on the ground to decompose and emit greenhouse gases, such as methane and CO2.  Reforestation will also contribute to carbon sequestration and maintaining healthy tropical ecosystems.The project will help prevent deforestation of the hurricane affected area by establishing plantations and setting aside areas for natural forest re-growth, rather than being converted into agricultural use or cattle farming lands.  The positive impact of the Project on the environment could be further increased if a future investment in a cogeneration power plant proves feasible.Community Engagement:The project will have a significant beneficial impact on local RAAN communities as it is the companys practice to allow the local community to benefit from company infrastructure, such as access roads, and provisions such as food, fuel, etc which are made available to them at cost.  The sponsor has already demonstrated their interest in working with indigenous communities through their work with the Layasiksa, a local community.

These impacts, including visual, noise, contractor and construction impact management, will be managed by the sponsor in close detail consistent with IFC and national requirements.  An independent EIA was completed and an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been developed.  Potential cumulative impacts associated with a second phase of the project were also assessed as part of the EIA.  The project, and the proposed Phase 2, is located on Forestry Department land, all of which is plantation forest.  The EIA confirms there will be no measurable impact on sensitive fauna or flora.  No resettlement or economic displacement will result from the project.  Several small parcels of land will be purchased/leased from private owners for a 1km section length of the projects transmission line; these transactions will be completed on a willing seller-market basis.  Particular care will be needed during construction related to erosion control and waste management associated with road expansion; this is specifically addressed in the EMP.  Formal and informal consultations conducted to date indicate strong support for the project due to the jobs and benefits it will bring to the local agrarian economy.  Visual and noise impacts are minimal due to the topography and distance to nearest receptors.  From an environmental and social perspective the project is very positive due to the carbon benefits it will generate.

(WHI) currently provides distributed water services through its retail outlets or Water Centers (WCs) spread across approximately 175 villages in the State of Andhra Pradesh in India.

The company has the benefit of a partial debt financing guarantee (of up to 50%) by DCC, amounting to $30 million which would therefore enable it to mobilize debt financing up to $60 million. Within the current project, it plans to install an additional about 800 systems in (200 WHC-65 systems and around 600 WHC-21 systems) over a 12-month horizon in villages spread across three states.","","","","","","IFC's involvement in the project is expected to have a development impact in terms of: 

- Access to affordable and potable drinking water: 

The lack of 24/7 safe drinking water has significant adverse impacts on the quality of life and health conditions of people. This Project will allow WIPL to replicate its success in providing reliable and quality water to people in rural areas increasing their health and overall longevity of life. Access to clean water would also help in significantly reducing the high number of water borne disease cases in the country. The systems installed through the current project are expected to be able to serve the potable water need of about five million people. 

- Strong Environmental benefits:

The adoption of WHI's systems also yields important environmental benefits. Firstly, in addition to its high energy efficiency, avoidance of the use of chemicals with potential toxic by-products, and minimal wastage of input water, one WHC-65 unit would displace the equivalent of 500 metric tons of carbon emissions that would have been created by boiling water with firewood. Secondly, as a high level of commercial and physical losses in the water sector make it commercially infeasible; the current Project assists in minimizing water losses by supplying water at the retail level thereby avoiding supply leakage losses. These benefits are expected to make the company eligible for credits under the CDM route.

- Contribution to employment opportunities 

Each WHC-65 employs two service operators, maintenance engineers and other requisite personnel. The company engages people from the village for these services and trains them to operate machines and perform the revenue collection function. As WIPL expands to more villages, it would provide employment, training and capacity building for locals in that area.","","","","","This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedure because a limited number of specific social and environmental impacts may result, which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

Canal expansion would: - allow the Canal to accommodate larger and more efficient container ships; - increase Canal capacity, and - decrease queuing time. These improvements would stimulate international trade and reduce global transportation costs. A positive environmental impact will derive from the shorter routes newly available to the post-Panamax ships unable to fit through the current locks.

The company has a total of 25 prospecting licenses in Mozambique covering an area of 4,760 km2.  The two main prospects are the Manica Project Area and the Tete Project Area. The Manica Project Area is host to a significant portion of the eastern extension of the Odzi-Penhalonga-Manica greenstone belt, which has produced more than two million ounces of gold approximately 10 kilometers away in Zimbabwe. The Mundonguara copper mine with gold and silver credits (Mundonguara), Baobabs most advanced project to date, is within this project area. Mining at Mundonguara was opened in 1902 and continued operations until 1989 when the mine was shut down due to the civil war in Mozambique. Baobab is now working to increase Mundonguaras resource base in order to develop commercial operations. The Tete Project Area is located immediately north of the provincial capital of Tete and is composed of 3 contiguous exploration licenses. The licenses contain 5 known vanadiferous titano-magnetite deposits. The area is considered analogous to various mineralized systems including the Bushveld Complex and is therefore also prospective for Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) mineralization as well as nickel/copper sulphide deposits. The Tete Project Area is still in the early exploration stage. Baobab is also undertaking exploration at Changara (Broken Hill type deposits), Sussendenga (gold lode desposits) and Senga Senga (Telfer type deposits).

IFC will assist Baobab to handle social, environmental, community development and mine closure issues in line with IFC Performance Standards on environmental and social sustainability.The proposed IFC investment will contribute to continued exploration and associated feasibility studies. The direct development impacts during the pure exploration and feasibility study stage are expected to be limited. Nonetheless, key impacts that will be monitored during the exploration and feasibility study phase will include:- employment; - consultation with stakeholders including local communities and Government; and - development of an appropriate environmental, social and community development plans for a mining exploitation project. Because the investment predates any feasibility study, it is not yet possible to fully quantify or specify the potential development impacts during production stage. Potential development impacts at the mine production stage could include: - local employment and sourcing; - taxes, royalties and other payments to the government; - technology and management skills transfer; and - setting new environmental and social benchmarks for mining operations in Mozambique.  IFCs proposed investment is consistent with the World Banks Country Partnership Strategy covering the period FY08  11 that emphasizes the need for Mozambique to pursue a vision based on regional economic integration, promoting foreign direct investment and export enhancement.  Extractive industries are specifically mentioned as some of the sectors that should be developed to make optimal use of the countrys natural resource base to expand export earnings and facilitate rural development, a central theme of the joint IMF-WBG Action Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty.","","The Mozambique government is actively engaged with the IMF and the World Bank Group (WBG) to establish fiscal and macroeconomic policies, e.g. a transparent public budgeting process, to ensure that government revenues are targeted at poverty reduction goals and objectives. With the recent commencement of commercial mining activities in the country, the Government has requested and won WBG support in assessing the barriers to EITI (Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative) implementation, and in assessing the net financial benefits and improvement in investment climate likely to accrue to Mozambique from the adoption of EITI principles. The WBG is working with the secretariat established by the Government on this project to implement EITI.Baobab is supportive of the efforts to implement good governance and transparency in the sector and will provide IFC with an undertaking that it will disclose publicly all payments made in the form of taxes, royalties, fees, etc., to the Government once it begins production.

IFC has an opportunity to participate in a landmark and pioneering project in Guinea by investing in the first new alumina refinery and resource downstream project in the country in 54 years. The Government of Guinea (the Government) and the general populace are particularly interested in the employment, vocational training and SME development potential of the project, which will be implemented through the Guinea Alumina Corporation (the Project Company) by the shareholders (the Sponsors), with the assistance of IFC. In addition, there is a strong commitment by the sponsors to achieve demonstrable socio-economic improvements in the communities to be impacted by the Project.The estimated total project cost (excluding financing costs) is $5.2 billion. The project has been granted a mining concession by the Government with an estimated 1.4 billion tonnes of bauxite. The refinery will process approximately 10 million tonnes of wet bauxite per year to produce approximately 3.3 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of alumina for over 50 years. Process optimization over the years could result in an upsize capacity approaching 4 Mtpa. The refinery has been designed to allow for a 50% capacity increase in alumina production. Project infrastructure includes: (i) a coal fired power plant producing 90 MW of electric power and between 500-700 tonnes of steam per hour. The refinerys calciners will use heavy fuel oil, with the potential to switch in part to biofuels if reliable and economic supplies can be procured; (ii) port facilities including a dedicated alumina terminal and container quay at the existing port of Kamsar; (iii) a new 14 km railway spur from the refinery site to the existing main railway line  and short spur connecting the main railway line to the alumina terminal; (iv) water reservoir and red mud (waste by-product of alumina production) dam disposal facilities; and (v) an employee housing camp.  Alumina is an intermediate product in the conversion of bauxite to aluminum. The majority of alumina produced globally is sold to aluminum producers on the basis of long term contracts priced off the aluminum London Metals Exchange (LME). The project company offtake agreements will be of a long-term nature, priced in reference to the LME high grade Aluminum 3-month price.","","","","","","The project will establish the first bauxite processing facility in Guinea in 54 years, as well as lead to the creation and improvement of various infrastructure facilities. As such, the expected development impacts from the project are substantial and diverse, and may include:(i) Generation of Direct and Indirect Employment: The Project is expected to create approximately 12,000 direct jobs (refinery and port sites) for local Guineans during construction and approximately 2,000 direct jobs (refinery and port sites) during the operations phase. Additionally, the creation of three to five secondary and tertiary jobs for each wage-paying job is anticipated. The project company is currently implementing some vocational and health/safety training to maximizing the sourcing of local skilled labor. The Boké Technical Training School will produce job-ready workers for the Project construction phase. The school is partly funded by the Governments Education Department which provides some training budget, power, equipment and materials. The project company has planned significant investment in providing additional resources and improving the facilities. About 1,000 Guineans attend classes in trade skill development.(ii) Fiscal Contributions: The project is expected to generate between $5-12.5 million per year in lump sum taxes to the Guinean government for the first 15 years of its operations. Beginning in the 16th year, tax on profits of 35% will be paid to the Government, averaging $418 million per year In addition, there will be a mining royalty tax averaging $22 million per year based on bauxite consumption. In total, the project is estimated to generate $8.2 billion of new tax revenue through 2044. The project company has agreed to publicly disclose all revenue payments made to the Government over the life of the project.  (iii) Community Development: The company has committed $2.5 million per year during construction. During operations, a compulsory contribution of $0.5 million per annum (for years 1 through 15) and $1.0 million per annum (from year 16 thereafter) is required.  In addition to this, the company has proposed a voluntary contribution of $3.5 million per annum for the duration of operations to fund community development programs, in the region and at the national level. The project company has also entered into a partnership with the African Development Foundation to implement a program for a school and health center in the main relocated village. Training initiatives for the community include training for village elementary school teachers, adult French literacy programs, environmental management, health and hygiene, understanding of national law, HIV/AIDS awareness and malaria prevention knowledge. In addition, the project company is planning to establish a community development foundation at the commencement of production, similar to the Mozal Community Development Trust in Mozambique. (iv) Support to Local SMEs:  Procurement of an estimated $150 million worth of goods and services in Guinea is expected during Project construction. Once built, an estimated $40 million worth of procurement is expected annually from within Guinea for continuing operations. (v) Public Infrastructure: The project is currently developing infrastructure projects that will benefit the broader population, including road and bridge upgrades from Kamsar port to the Sangarédi refinery site, construction of the container terminal at Kamsar and improvements in the Government owned railway operations. In addition, the project is expected to lead to improvements in the social infrastructure in Boke and Sangarédi where housing will be built and employees will be supported to own their own homes.Key indicators that are proposed to be used to monitor the development impact of the project during its life are: (i) taxes and royalties paid to the Government; (ii) direct and indirect jobs created during the construction and operational phases; (iii) number of employees having received vocational training by the project company; (iv) number and total value of contracting arrangements with domestic businesses; and (v) total expenditures incurred by the project company on community development activities. The project company has commissioned a socio-economic impact assessment study for the project based on a scope of work agreed with the DFIs. This study will be publicly disclosed when completed and form the basis of agreeing key performance indicators on socio-economic impacts for the Project.  Fit with World Bank Group Strategy:The World Bank Group is at an early stage of revising its Country Assistance Strategy for Guinea, which is likely to focus on support to the Government for the implementation of further measures to improve economic governance, urgent investments in water and electricity and capacity building for better governance of the mining sector. Within this overall framework, the recent focus of IFCs activities in Guinea has been the mining sector. In 2006, IFC approved its first investment project in Guinea: support for a locally incorporated subsidiary for Rio Tintos Simandou iron ore project in eastern Guinea. Looking forward, IFCs priorities in the sector in Guinea will be supporting companies that play an important role in promoting governance and transparency, as well as working closely with mining companies to broaden and deepen the socio-economic impacts of their projects. The proposed investment is consistent with these priorities.","","","","","The review of this project consisted of appraising the projects technical, environmental and social information, several visits to the projects refinery and port sites and interviews with the project companys managers and operations personnel, representatives of project affected communities and local and national administration.

In early August 2008, one paper machine, a 300 tonnes/day (tpd) machine (PM6) making test liner and fluting, supported by a 225 tpd OCC slushing line and 110 tpd wheat straw CTMP line were in operation.  Packages plans to commission a nominal 330 tpd printing and writing paper line (PM7), and a 220 tpd de-inked pulp line at Kasur over the next several months.Paper-making at Lahore is being run down with the start of manufacturing at BSPM.  However, when reviewed, a 120 tpd three-layer white board machine (PM1), and a 26 tpd tissue machine remained (PM4).  A new 100 tpd tissue line (PM9) is due for start-up in August 2008.  Lahore produces chemical pulp from wheat straw using an alkaline sulfite process, and has recycled fibre lines to support tissue-making.   Lahore also has a large board printing facility, and manufactures printed and laminated flexible packaging materials.  The project is an IFC subscription to an equity issue proposed by Packages.  Proceeds will be used to retire debt and for the following physical projects: - installation of an incineration system to control solvent emissions from the board and flexible packaging printing lines; - recovery or incineration of solvents arising from flexible packaging lamination lines; - enhanced treatment of process effluents arising from the Lahore operations, and/or investment at BSPM designed to advance the transfer of papermaking from Lahore to BSPM.

In May 2008 IFC and SRED concluded an agreement under whose terms IFC conditionally agreed to support selected commercial real estate development projects in Southern and Eastern Europe.   Mihai Bravu is the first such sub-project to be considered for IFC support under the terms of this agreement.  The project is being developed by a SRED-controlled project company Banat SRL (Banat or the Company.)Mihai Bravu sub-project is a 112 million 15-floor office building that will include underground and outside parking lots. The office will also host a small retail area that will offer services to the tenants. The project is being developed on a plot of some 7,700 m2 :  the gross area of the project is approx. 69.500 m² over ground and approx. 29.200 m² underground.  Of this, there will be approximately 54.000 m² or rentable office space and. 4.000 m² of retail space. In addition there will be storage rooms and 670 parking spaces, which will mostly be underground.  The Project is located in Sector 3 directly on the Blvd. Mihai Bravu which connects the northern part of the city with the south-eastern part. The Boulevard is a four-lane-street with tramway line in the middle.  At the time of review, SRED had acquired the site and was commencing studies necessary to complete the projects social and environmental assessment, and complete project design.","","","","IFCs has had several stages of review of this Project.  Before committing the investment facility IFC met Soravia at their Vienna headquarters where SREDs general approach to project design and management of social and environmental risk was discussed.  SRED developments were also visited, the TownTown project in Vienna and the Soravia Business Center development in Skopje, Macedonia.  The conclusions of this earlier social and environmental review may be viewed on IFCs web site under project #26132In its review of the Mihai Bravu project, IFC met Soravias local management team in Bucharest, and visited the site of the future Mihai Bravu project.  In addition, the IFC team visited another SRED development in Bucharest Metropolis Centre in order to understand the EHS construction practices adopted by a Romanian general contractor employed by SRED.  Subsequently IFC reviewed an EHS assessment of the current conditions at the site and of potential impacts during the construction of the sub-project, prepared by SRED.","","","","","","","","","","","","Key environmental and social issues associated with this sub-project are the project design and planning processes, including social and environmental assessment and putting in place appropriate permissions.

Himadri is known as one of the highest quality producers of coal tar pitch in the world, and its products are used by several, major international customers.  The company is also only one of three companies worldwide that is able to produce zero Q.I. Coal Tar Impregnating Pitch, a high quality pitch used for impregnation of graphite electrodes, and it is the only company outside Japan able to manufacture it.Himadri uses coal tar in India as its raw material which is a by product of recovery type high temperature coke oven batteries.  The Company distills such into useful coal-tar pitch and derivatives, thereby creating useful economic value from a low-value feedstock. During the manufacturing process, the company also produces various industrial oils as by-products that can be further used as feedstock for the production of carbon black, a key input for tire manufacturers. Given strong demand, Himadri is expanding its present coal tar pitch distillation capacity of 169,000 metric tons per annum (mtpa) in India to 400,000 mtpa.  Phase I consists of (i) increasing its distillation capacity to 250,00 mtpa, (ii) setting up a 50,000 mtpa carbon black production facility and (iii) constructing an associated 12 mega-watt waste-heat recovery based power plant (together, the Project).","","","","","","The project is expected to have a strong developmental impact including environmental efficiency, employment generation and increased business opportunities for the local and wider areas.- Carbon Footprint/Climate Change:  Once the expansion is completed, waste heat generated in the production process will be used to (i) generate the entire amount of power that the plant complex would consume and generate a surplus to be sold to the local grid & (ii) meet the entire heating needs of the production process, thus eliminating the current need for burning oil or any other fuel to produce heat. Both these impacts will significantly reduce the companys carbon footprint, even with a significantly expanded plant capacity.- Investment in the lesser developed Eastern Region of India:  Himadris plants are located in the eastern region of India, an economically laggard area with one of the lowest per-capita incomes in the country.  The eastern part also has the largest concentration of poor in India, and its advantages in terms of low wage rates are offset by its poor business environment and the absence of adequate infrastructure. Since the economy is primarily agrarian, this project would help strengthen and diversify the regions economic base and create new jobs.  It is anticipated the project would require 150 additional employees.- Local supplier linkages:  Himadri sources a large portion of its raw material from domestic steel producers in India.  As various components of the Project come on-line, Himadri will require additional large amounts of coal tar from the steel producers, providing the industry with additional sales outlets, revenue generation and flexibility in disposing of waste products.- Efficient Waste Recycling:  Reprocessing of waste coal tar from the steel industry into value-added products through this Project results in minimization of indiscriminate disposal of waste from steel mills and helps improve the overall ecological footprint.Proposed key indicators to track the developmental impact of the project include:- Surplus power made available to the local grid.- Direct employment generation.- Volume of domestic coal tar supply distilled by the company into higher-value products.","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review procedures because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

- Delivery of high quality health care services to Afghan people: Afghanistan is among the least developed countries in the world.  ACOMET will bring much needed health care capacity and new services to Afghanistan.

- Training critically needed medical workers: Due to the recent conflicts in Afghanistan, many medical professionals emigrated from the country.  This combined with the general global demand for health care workers has caused a critical shortage of trained workers in Afghanistan.  ACOMET will focus on providing quality medical education to doctors and nurses in Afghanistan and provide valuable internship opportunities to students.  Furthermore, the health care workers who remained in Afghanistan during the war were professionally isolated from the rest of the global medical community receiving poor out-dated training.  ACOMET will offer continuing education to bring its employees up to speed with global standards.

- Retain income in Afghanistan: Hundreds of Afghans travel to neighboring countries for medical treatments each year due to the lack of quality facilities locally.  The Hospital will be able to treat a portion of these patients keeping the income in the country and reducing the hardship of travel for patients and their families.

Salamander UJV,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,East Asia and the Pacific,East Asia and Pacific Region,OPHIR THAILAND (E&P) LIMITED,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2008-11-20T05:00:00Z,2008-12-23T05:00:00Z,B,Equity,"Salamander Energy plc (Salamander or the Company) has invited IFC to support certain of its exploration activities in South East Asia, by acquiring a project-level equity interest in:- the Savannakhet production sharing contract (Savannakhet PSC) in Lao PDR (Laos) and the adjacent concession L26/50 in onshore Thailand, as well as,- L15/50, another concession onshore Northeast Thailand (together known as the Project).Currently, the company has a 70% interest in the Savannakhet PSC and a 100% interest in the Thai concessions, and is the operator of all three blocks.","","","","","","Fit With World Bank Group Strategy:The most recent World Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy for Laos (FY07-11WBG CAS) has four major aims: - private sector development and finance; - sustainable natural resource development; - public financial management; and - poverty reduction.  Thailands National Development Agenda, which forms the framework for a partnership between Thailand and the World Bank, is built around four pillars, including Natural Resources and Environment.  The Bank has also been supporting Thailands emerging role as a development assistance donor and an advocate for strengthening regional cooperation. The Bank also supports the Lao-Thai Partnership in Sustainable Hydropower Development to ensure that future hydropower projects in Laos will be friendlier to the environment and the people affected by them. It also works with the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy Business Council to promote investments and strengthen private sector cooperation within the Greater Mekong Sub-region.Within this overall framework, IFCs strategic priorities in the region are to: - increase impact in IDA countries; - lead efforts to address climate change; and - reach the underserved in frontier regions.  In the oil and gas sector, IFCs focus is to pursue more early equity investments (for which capital from other sources is more limited) and to be a long-term partner for companies that seek to attain international standards in their operations, including environmental and social practices, while supporting countries in the sustainable development of their domestic sources of energy, especially natural gas (a clean source of fuel). This investment is consistent with both the World Bank and IFC strategies, since it supports a junior oil and gas company operating in an IDA country (Laos) and a frontier region (Northeast Thailand) and in a project focusing on development of natural gas resources. Development Impact:Should the project progress successfully to commercial production, it is expected to generate the following development impacts: Pilot Development Of The Upstream Sector In Laos:  Salamanders activity represents the first investment in upstream oil and gas in Laos since 1998.  If the Company is successful in its exploration efforts, the Project would help demonstrate the viability of investment by small independents in the Lao upstream sector and help catalyze the development of an upstream industry in the country.  Supporting Further Regional Cooperation Between Laos And Thailand Through Potential Export Of Gas/Electricity To Thailand And Cooperation In Other Infrastructure Development In The Bordering Area: Thailand is expected to be, at least initially, the principal market for Laotian gas.  Discovery of gas may lead to development of gas-fired electricity generation in Laos, with any excess electricity exported to Thailand.  This will help further development of the infrastructure in the region which already exists for the export of hydro power from Laos to Thailand and the import of gas-fired generated electricity from Thailand to Laos during the dry season.Increased Supply Of Domestic Sources Of Energy, Import Substitution, Promoting The Development And Use Of Natural Gas As A Cleaner Fuel:  The Project will increase the supply of domestic sources of energy in Laos and Thailand, helping reduce their need to use limited foreign currency reserves for expensive energy imports.  The investment will support the exploration for and development of natural gas reserves, a cleaner source of fuel.Supporting Local Economic Development Through Payments To The Government:  The governments of Laos and Thailand will receive fiscal receipts from hydrocarbon production taxes, bonuses and corporate taxes generated by the investment.  Under the Savannakhet PSC, the Government takes 45% of oil or 37% of gas as its share of profit petroleum and an income tax of 30% on taxable profits in addition to various production bonuses, rentals, training and government assistance payment. Under the Thai concessions, the Government takes a royalty of 5-15% of gross revenue and an income tax of 50% on taxable profits.  Approximately 15% of royalties in Thailand are expected to ultimately accrue to the regions where the oil and gas activities are undertaken.Creating Some Job Opportunities And Providing Training In Local Communities: The Project will generate some job opportunities in Laos and Northeast Thailand, where agriculture is the primary business and few other job opportunities are available. In addition, the Company will also contribute to training of local staff and development of a domestic labor force with knowledge of the oil and gas industry.IFC plans to monitor the following development impacts: - gas sales;- payments to governments; and- employment.","","It is expected that benefits from the project will accrue to different levels of government in Laos and Thailand in the form of royalties and taxes. In evaluating this project, IFC took into consideration the value of the projects benefits and governance and other risks to these benefits. In particular, it utilized a range of governance assessment methodologies, including but not limited to Transparency Internationals Corruption Perceptions Index and the World Bank Institutes Governance Indicators, as well as the current relationship between each country and the WBG. For the past several years, the WBG has been partnering with Thai public and private institutions on a range of important developmental challenges, including governance and public sector reform. In Laos, poverty reduction and government capacity building have been the priority for the WBG country strategy. Given the governance context, the expected development impact and the projected benefits, IFC believes that this is a project which it should support.","","","The project is a Category B project according to IFCs Policy for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because it has limited adverse social or environmental impacts that are few in number, are site specific and will largely be reversible and readily addressed through mitigation measures.

This holds true particularly for China, where growth is fueled by efficient deployment of information technology. Datacenter operations are critical to ensure the security and stability of IT services for all businesses. This is becoming an increasingly necessary component of IT solutions in China as businesses (particularly in the Financial Services Industry) deal with increasingly sensitive and critical information; and firms in China finalize the centralization of their IT production systems, thus making IT services particularly vulnerable to business interruption stemming from threats of any nature, from power outages to natural disasters.An investment in this nascent and underinvested industry will greatly support the companys ability to develop and grow in the domestic datacenter sector, specifically in secondary areas.  While much emphasis has been put into developing sophisticated IT solutions for companies in China, only recently (especially after the devastating earthquake in Sichuan) has the importance of data security, backup, and consolidation been stressed in the business community.

Wind Telecom S.A.

The company's services are provided through a mix of technologies including WiMAX , point-to-point microwave, fiber optics and MMDS.

The purpose of the project is to provide triple play services across the main cities in Dominican Republic. WIND has acquired national spectrum rights (20-year license).

La Vega, San Pedro Macoris, La Romana, San Francisco, Mao, Esperanza, San Cristobal, Moca and Puerto Plata.","","","","","","Improvement in Telephony and TV Access:
The project promotes the convergence of different services under one package, thus improving connectivity and reducing gaps in access by:

- Extending coverage of basic telecommunication services: WIND expects to eventually deploy a quasi-nationwide network. Its wireless technology contributes to more efficient, cheaper and wider coverage, which includes un-served and underserved areas of the Dominican Republic.

- Reducing pricing: A new entrant like WIND would be promoting competition against the incumbent telcos and pay TV providers. The synergies provided by a triple play offering, and by the development of a mostly wireless network, should support a case for lower overall pricing.

- Increasing service offerings: WIND provides an ample array of services, including connectivity (voice and data) and video for individual users as well as corporate data products such as co-hosting and co-location.

- Distributing relevant content: Unlike with other wireless video platforms (i.e., DTH), WIND offers a new distribution channel for local programming.

Formalizing provision of TV services:
The entrance of new players like WIND, with digital networks, has allowed regulator Indotel to formalize the TV sector, where piracy was rampant.


Reduce intra-country digital divide:
Even though mobile voice and fixed data density has been on the rise nationally, rural and suburban areas are far behind. WIND has a scalable nationwide deployment strategy, thus taking digital services to poorer areas of the country. Lack of basic services at affordable rates is a critical problem for micro-business owners, impeding economic development. WIND's state-of-the-art technology allows for technology transfer to and within the Dominican Republic.

Broadband connectivity:
Broadband services are critical for improving the operational efficiency of Government and large and small enterprises. At the retail level, fast internet access contributes to improving communications, exchange of information and entertainment. The Dominican Republic currently lags its peer countries in Broadband penetration rates, the Project will support an increase in this penetration levels by making the service more widely available and accessible.

Employment: 
WIND currently employs over 170 people. By 2012 it expects over 300 direct employees, not counting indirect employment (independent distributors).

Focus on educational corridors: 
WIND's initial backhaul roll-out focused strongly in connecting the major universities in the Dominican Republic. 

Free educational channels:
The company, together with the Government, launched a plan to provide free TV access to 8 international educational channels (from HBO and Discovery) for 300 public schools, with the idea of extending such program to 3,000 public schools in the next two years as the network footprint increases.","","","","","The key environmental and social issue associated with the project are environmental, health, safety, and social management; labor and working conditions (including employee and contractor occupational health and safety); and pollution prevention and abatement.

Implementation support: Paynet has passed the initial set up period and may need less implementation support in terms of set up than to the PCB. But it would need professional business/ financial advice to prepare the company for its plan IPO/listing in local stock exchange by 2010 as its shareholders currently plan.Fit with World Bank Group Strategy and IFC Role:The project fits well with World Bank Group and IFCs strategy of developing financial infrastructure to enable better access to finance. Financial infrastructure is high impact, as it touches at least every 5th person in emerging markets, with potential to help many more. Since 2001, IFC has supported credit bureau development in over 45 countries and monitored development of credit reporting in 178 countries via Doing Business. The World Bank is the leading institution worldwide in reforming payment, remittance and securities settlement systems. Over the past 12 years, the WB has supported reforms of National Payment Systems in over 100 countries and is actively involved in the implementation of the General Principles for International Remittance Services to reduce the cost of these services.Particularly in Vietnam, the Project fits well with World Bank Groups strategy in Vietnam to support strengthening central bank function while promoting private sector initiatives to participate in small/micro retail payment systems development and operation. The World Bank has been actively supporting the development of inter-bank large volume payment system and has suggested IFC to consider supporting the development of retail/ micro payment system. IFC Advisory is supporting the State Bank of Vietnam to develop a national automated clearing system for retail payments, initially funding a feasibility study. The proposed investment and advisory services in Paynet fits well with both World Bank and IFCs strategy. Additionality & IFC Role:Retail payment processing (including mobile phone banking) is a highly dynamic industry that has undergone drastic technological and business model changes over the past 5-6 years. Change continues to come from many fronts, such as banks and microfinance companies, telecom operators and other types of dynamic and independent entrants. In Vietnam, the sector is just emerging and currently, there is no dominant player.  Some of the private sector players are keen to acquire the international expertise and knowledge that IFC brings in this sector.  IFCs global presence and knowledge, its understanding of winning business models and technological trends, combined with the mandate of promoting private sector development through increasing access to financial services makes it uniquely qualified to help spearhead this emerging industry.  IFC has invested in a mobile bank operator in Africa (Wizzit), a payment processor in the Gulf (Eastnets), and is exploring a regional partnership in this field with ANZ (Wing).IFC Advisory Services is evaluating a payment sector advisory program, under which technical support for Paynet would be provided primarily in two areas:Policy advocacy: where IFC will continue to support the enabling legal framework. Currently the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) is working on regulations for all third party non bank payment operators/companies.  IFC-MPDF is currently supporting the SBV with a feasibility study for an automatic clearing house for commercial payments; andImplementation support: Paynet is in the initial set up period and needs implementation support in the areas of strategy, network and products development.  IFCs Advisory Services is looking to provide support in term of developing a cohesive strategy to support the companys ambitious growth plan, especially expansion into other market segments such as postpaid utilities payments (electricity, water, ADSL etc.), e-commerce payment gateway for suppliers, and ATM & POS networks outsourcing and maintenance for commercial banks.  In terms of network support, while Paynet has achieved substantial results in expanding its retail network (currently, 2,000 points of presence), it is going to further expand aggressively further, most notably the planned integration with the VN Post network (of more than 15,000 points) by end 2008/ early 2009.  Advisory Services would look into providing Paynet with support to ensure such milestone integration would be successful. In terms of products, Paynet is in the process of piloting many new products such as NetCash (e-wallet), mPay (payment via Mobile phone), domestic remittance etc. These products need specialist knowledge and Paynet could benefit greatly from IFC''s advisory support.IFCs investment and advisory services package to Paynet will help the company access global knowledge and expertise and thereby, rapidly increase capacity in order to serve the growing market demand for electronic payment products in Vietnam.  The demonstration of a successful model of emerging alternative payment platforms in Vietnam is expected to provide a tremendous boost and thereby, to provide the necessary attention to lift the alternative payment platform sector. Project Strengths, Risks and Issues:StrengthsStrong and committed sponsor/ management team: Paynets shareholders and management team are experienced and reputable businessman/ professionals, who have been very committed to Paynets business. Business model: our initial assessment (thru advisory services where an international CEO of a mobile phone company in Africa came in and did a quick market diagnostic) realizes that Paynets business model has high chance of success. Its open-loop (vs. close loop) technology infrastructure allows connection with multiple telcos and financial institutions, making the economies of scale and accordingly high profitability possible. Relatively high upside potential Paynet is a small technology driven company, which requires relatively small initial paid in capital and with fast growing market demand, it offers relatively high upside potential. Market growth: Vietnam untapped retail and micro payment market is huge and offers Paynet a large potential business for years to come. RisksFinancial reporting and transparency: Set up as a small company with very lean structure, Paynet has not yet paid attention to proper financial reporting and transparency. The companys account is un-audited. However, if we consider investment, we can demand international audit as precondition. Increasing competition:  this lucrative business attracts increasing competition, although Paynet was the first company and has the advantage of first mover, overtime competition will impact the companys profitability. Most dangerous competition will come from telcos who possess network and clients. Paynets upcoming alliance with VN Post is seen as a risk mitigant but only to some extent.

Kosmos Energy,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Africa,Ghana,Kosmos Energy,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2008-12-19T05:00:00Z,2009-01-29T05:00:00Z,B,Loan,"Kosmos Energy Ghana HC ('Kosmos' or the 'Company') is indirectly wholly owned by Kosmos Energy Holdings, a privately-held Cayman Island company.  Affiliates under common control with the company hold exploration acreage positions across multiple blocks offshore West Africa, principally in Ghana but also in Benin, Cameroon, Morocco, and Nigeria.  In June 2007, its exploration work led to the discovery of the Jubilee oil field offshore of Ghana.

The project involves the first phase of development ('Phase 1') of the Jubilee field.  It involves the drilling of 17 wells (nine production wells, five water injection wells, and three gas injection wells), sub-sea production installations and leasing of a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel for processing, storage and handling of crude.  Initial estimated gross production capacity is 120,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) and will increase as the field is further developed and more reserves are proven.","","","","","","Fit with World Bank Group Strategy:  

Ghana's poverty reduction strategy seeks to (i) raise private sector competitiveness; (ii) improve human development outcomes with interventions in health, education, water and sanitation, and social protection sectors; and (iii) strengthen governance through decentralization, public sector reform, and promotion of results-based public policy choice.

To help with its strategy, the World Bank Group's program in Ghana has set three overarching objectives:  increasing economic growth, reducing poverty and reducing inequalities.  The goal of increasing economic growth rests primarily on the expansion of the private sector, its competitiveness and its diversification.  To support this economic growth objective, IFC's strategy in Ghana has focused on supporting private provision of infrastructure, deepening the domestic financial sector, expanding opportunities for micro, small and medium scale enterprise borrowing through local financial institutions, promoting the development of non-traditional exports and enhancing the business environment.

IFC's support of the project is consistent with this strategy:  It promotes the development of a private sector-led industry that can generate exports and/or replace expensive imports of crude by local refineries and opens up avenues for additional downstream investments by using gas that can provide energy to sustain economic growth.  It will provide Government with the resources needed to pursue its poverty reduction strategy.

Development Impact:
The development of the Jubilee oil field is expected to generate substantial benefits for the country:

-  Develop domestic sources of energy:  The project would help develop local sources of energy which opens up options for the Government to address critical issues such as dependence on foreign crude imports and foreign exchange generation.  The project also raises the possibility of gas production, which can provide substantial opportunities at addressing the shortage of power in the country.

-  Expand exports/reduce imports:  The project would help add to Ghana's exports and generate substantial foreign exchange earnings through export of crude.  Alternatively, local oil production will allow Ghana to replace crude oil imports, thereby conserving foreign exchange for the country. 

-  Attract foreign direct investment:  Although oil exploration has been taking place in Ghana since its independence in 1957, few oil companies have shown interest in the country.  The size of the Jubilee field and its successful development should spur significant interest from major oil companies and energize Ghana's hydrocarbon sector by increasing exploration and development activities in the country.  This interest should result in expanding foreign direct investment in Ghana, which has remained relatively low for an economy of its potential.

-  Generate revenues for Government:  It is expected that the Government of Ghana will receive substantial fiscal receipts from royalties, production sharing and corporate taxes, generated by oil production from the project.

-  Create direct employment:  Production operations and onshore support will bring employment opportunities.  Approximately 156 employment opportunities with between 10% to 50% local staffing content are expected.  In addition, marine and aviation support operations will continue to provide approximately 60 employment opportunities with a local staff complement of between 30% and 80%.  Such employment would also bring a new set of skills and technology into the country and would expand the employment opportunities of local participants both regionally and globally. 

-  Stimulate demand for local goods and services:  Under the Petroleum Agreement signed with the Government, Kosmos and its partners shall give preference to materials, services and products produced in Ghana.  The focus on locally produced goods and services will encourage economic activity in other areas such as construction, rentals, fabrication and business services.

The key development indicators that are proposed to be monitored during the life of the IFC investment are:
- annual oil production;
- direct employment levels;
- production sharing and fiscal payments accruing to the Governments; and
- annual expenditures on domestic goods and services.","","
A part of the Project's expected benefits are in the form of royalties, share of production and tax payments to Government.  In coming to a view of whether to support this project, IFC considered the value of the project's benefits and the governance and other risks to these benefits.  In doing so, IFC has reviewed a variety of governance assessments on Ghana, including the World Bank Institute's Governance Indicators, as well as Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI).  The WBI indicators show that Ghana is well above the regional average while the latest CPI ranks Ghana ahead of some middle-income countries.  These indicators show that Ghana is performing reasonably well on governance and that the governance foundations for Ghana's development are good.  Donors agree that the Government has significantly improved the management of public resources in recent years.  Although political constraints have tended to slow implementation of reforms and controls, progress is definitely being made.  Furthermore, the Government has made governance a key component of the Government's poverty reduction strategy and has taken tangible steps in making progress on this aspect, such as being the first to go through the African Peer Review Mechanism.  On balance, therefore, it is deemed that, although the Government still needs to step up its performance, the governance risks to the benefits from the Project are acceptable.","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedures, because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

IFC MLF,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Active,World,World Region,"MICROFINANCE ENHANCEMENT FACILITY S.A., SICAV-SIF","Global Industry, Financial Markets",2008-12-29T05:00:00Z,2009-01-29T05:00:00Z,FI,Loan,"IFC, together with KfW, proposes to rapidly launch a global Microfinance Liquidity Facility (MLF or the Facility) designed to support sound MFIs worldwide that may face a funding shortfall during this time of unprecedented financial stress. The IFC MLF is a pure bottom-up initiative, fully based on specific funding needs of a detailed pre-determined pipeline of MFIs operating globally. The MLFs objective is not to support the impressive growth rates experienced by MFIs over the last decade, but to serve as a defensive facility to support strong institutions in the current credit freeze. This project will support over 100 MFIs operating in over 30 countries, including over 20 IDA countries. IFC will execute the program through the industrys largest and most experienced fund managers in order to: - provide a rapid and flexible response to market needs; - achieve maximum possible outreach; and - ensure efficiency.Backed by KfW, IFC proposes to launch the MLF, a two phased Facility to support over 100 MFIs for a total of $500 million. A detailed bottom-up analysis of the market indicates needs of up to $1.8 billion through year-end 2009. IFC and its partners propose to execute the MLF in two phases providing needed funding of $500 million. A key element of the phased approach is how IFC will leverage additional financing and mobilize other partners to participate in funding the Facility.","","","","","","Direct Contribution to Poverty Reduction: This project will provide access to finance millions of borrowers over the life of the proposed facilities. Supporting productive small businesses will in turn stimulate growth, employment generation and poverty reduction. Furthermore, IFCs proposed liquidity facility will: - provide needed short-term funding so that MFIs can maintain operations and healthy portfolios; - assure that MFIs can maintain their existing client base of micro-enterprises over the next 12-18 months; - provide a reassuring signal to deposit taking clients of additional liquidity within MFIs; and - maintain confidence in the microfinance asset class.Support the Microfinance Industry in a Time of Crisis: By supporting the MLF, IFC will support over 100 MFIs operating in 30 countries (including 20 + IDA countries) by providing them with emergency commercial funding in order to maintain operations and provide comfort to their deposit clients. While IFC and other like-minded investors strongly support savings mobilization, by providing liquidity to financial institutions, IFC will also be providing confidence to microfinance deposit clients world-wide.  IFC will coordinate with CGAP and its partners to disseminate facility information.Demonstration Effect: IFCs MLF should stimulate other local and international investors by demonstrating that MFIs represent a strong asset class in a time of crisis. This initiative will confirm IFCs role as the industrys lead investor and supporter through a rapid response to the market by implementing its counter-cyclical strategy.Facilitate the Access of MFIs to Commercial Funding:  The current demand of credit by underserved micro enterprises in emerging markets far exceeds the funding provided by donors and commercial lenders.  In order to satisfy the demand and unleash the productive capacity of these micro enterp","","","","","This project involves IFC support for the business of Microfinance and has been classified as a Category FI project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

Because a substantial part of the capital expenditure will go towards the development of the Ghana Jubilee Field Phase 1, the project categorization was given based on the review of this development, for which a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result that can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.  The key issues identified during appraisal of the Project, and described in detail in this Environmental and Social Review Summary, were:

- Establishing an Integrated Environmental, Health, Safety and Social Management System ('EHSS MS'), particularly in managing change in the Project beyond Phase 1;
- Occupational health and safety management, including job hazard analyses, fire and explosion prevention and control;
- Emergency response and community safety, including oil spill preparedness and response, well blowout prevention;
- Sustainable management of production waste and drilling fluids and cuttings during development; and
- Impacts on the marine biota, with specific attention to endangered species potentially present in the Project area.

The Project will be located in deep water (1000 to 1700m), approximately 60 km from the nearest point on the coast with Ghana. The location of the Project will mean that impacts from production waste will be limited, and any health and safety issues can be readily handled using well-known procedures and engineering technology.  Since mitigation measures for the identified impacts can be readily defined, adverse impacts are not expected to be diverse or irreversible, and they will be limited to the Project area.

If Tullow uses a remaining part of the IFC Loans for other projects in the future, the Company will follow the requirements of PS 1 in the assessment and management of their social and environmental risks, including local community and other stakeholder engagement as appropriate to the projects risks and impacts.","","","","",27918,"",AB - Oil and Gas Production (Includes Development),"","","",""
Tullow Oil,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Africa,Ghana,TULLOW OIL PLC,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2009-01-16T05:00:00Z,2009-02-19T05:00:00Z,B,Loan,"In 2007, Tullow Oil plc (Tullow) and its partners discovered the Jubilee oil field offshore of Ghana. The project involves the first phase of development of the Jubilee field. It involves the drilling of 17 wells (nine production wells, five water injection wells, and three gas injection wells), sub-sea production installations and leasing of a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel for processing, storage and handling of crude. Initial estimated gross production capacity is 120,000 barrels of oil per day and will increase as the field is further developed and more reserves are proven.","","","","","","World Bank Groups Strategy:Ghanas poverty reduction strategy seeks to:- raise private sector competitiveness; - improve human development outcomes with interventions in health, education, water and sanitation, and social protection sectors; and - strengthen governance through decentralization, public sector reform, and promotion of results-based public policy choice.To help with its strategy, the World Bank Groups program in Ghana has set three overarching objectives:  increasing economic growth, reducing poverty and reducing inequalities.  The goal of increasing economic growth rests primarily on the expansion of the private sector, its competitiveness and its diversification.  To support this economic growth objective, IFCs strategy in Ghana has focused on supporting private provision of infrastructure, deepening the domestic financial sector, expanding opportunities for micro, small and medium scale enterprise borrowing through local financial institutions, promoting the development of non-traditional exports and enhancing the business environment.IFCs support of the project is consistent with this strategy:  It promotes the development of a private sector-led industry that can generate exports and/or replace expensive imports of crude by local refineries and opens up avenues for additional downstream investments by using gas that can provide energy to sustain economic growth.  It will provide Government with the resources needed to pursue its poverty reduction strategy.Development Impact:The development of the Jubilee oil field is expected to generate substantial benefits for the country:-  Develop domestic sources of energy:  The project would help develop local sources of energy which opens up options for the Government to address critical issues such as dependence on foreign crude imports and foreign exchange generation.  The project also raises the possibility of gas production, which can provide substantial opportunities at addressing the shortage of power in the country.-  Expand exports/reduce imports:  The project would help add to Ghanas exports and generate substantial foreign exchange earnings through export of crude.  Alternatively, local oil production will allow Ghana to replace crude oil imports, thereby conserving foreign exchange for the country. -  Attract foreign direct investment:  Although oil exploration has been taking place in Ghana since its independence in 1957, few oil companies have shown interest in the country.  The size of the Jubilee field and its successful development should spur significant interest from major oil companies and energize Ghanas hydrocarbon sector by increasing exploration and development activities in the country.  This interest should result in expanding foreign direct investment in Ghana, which has remained relatively low for an economy of its potential.-  Generate revenues for Government:  It is expected that the Government of Ghana will receive substantial fiscal receipts from royalties, production sharing and corporate taxes, generated by oil production from the project.-  Create direct employment:  Production operations and onshore support will bring employment opportunities.  Approximately 156 employment opportunities with between 10% to 50% local staffing content are expected.  In addition, marine and aviation support operations will continue to provide approximately 60 employment opportunities with a local staff complement of between 30% and 80%.  Such employment would also bring a new set of skills and technology into the country and would expand the employment opportunities of local participants both regionally and globally. -  Stimulate demand for local goods and services:  Under the Petroleum Agreement signed with the Government, Tullow and its partners shall give preference to materials, services and products produced in Ghana.  The focus on locally produced goods and services will encourage economic activity in other areas such as construction, rentals, fabrication and business services.The key development indicators that are proposed to be monitored during the life of the IFC investment are:- annual oil production;- direct employment levels;- production sharing and fiscal payments accruing to the Governments; and- annual expenditures on domestic goods and services.","","A part of the Project's expected benefits are in the form of royalties, share of production and tax payments to Government.  In coming to a view of whether to support this project, IFC considered the value of the projects benefits and the governance and other risks to these benefits.  In doing so, IFC has reviewed a variety of governance assessments on Ghana, including the World Bank Institutes Governance Indicators, as well as Transparency Internationals Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI).  The WBI indicators show that Ghana is well above the regional average while the latest CPI ranks Ghana ahead of some middle-income countries.  These indicators show that Ghana is performing reasonably well on governance and that the governance foundations for Ghanas development are good.  Donors agree that the Government has significantly improved the management of public resources in recent years.  Although political constraints have tended to slow implementation of reforms and controls, progress is definitely being made.  Furthermore, the Government has made governance a key component of the Governments poverty reduction strategy and has taken tangible steps in making progress on this aspect, such as being the first to go through the African Peer Review Mechanism.  In addition, the Company has agreed to disclose publicly its payments to governments at the national level.  On balance, therefore, it is deemed that, although the Government still needs to step up its performance, the governance risks to the benefits from the Project are acceptable.","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedures.

An environmental & social development specialist undertook an appraisal of the projects in Kosovo and Armenia and interacted with the Companys consultants and management team on the project details, development plan, the environmental and social (E&S) impact assessments, consultation conducted to-date, and any updates required thereafter.Following IFC first investment in Lydian (Project #25924) in June 2007, IFC staff carried out a detailed E&S supervision visit in May 2008 of the exploration properties in Armenia and Kosovo. Additionally regular meetings took place to discuss Action Plan progress with Lydian management took place in London on October, 2007 and February, 2008. A second appraisal of the Drazhnje property, the most advanced project in Kosovo took place during 3 days in October 2008 followed by discussions at the corporate level in December 2008.The key objectives of the regular visits and meetings were targeted as: - ensuring compliance of exploration activities with IFC requirements; - reviewing progress on the  Environmental and Social Action Plan for compliance with schedule and - assessing next steps including dates when moving onto the phase of feasibility study.The focus was on the preliminary environmental and social data, the need for documenting legal requirements as well as the initial results of exploration works such as trench, drilling and adits. Most of this information has been prepared in 2006 and early 2007. IFC did a detailed review of key strategic documents and corporate policies. During appraisal the IFC team highlighted future challenges on community relations as the projects progress through exploration works and potential subsequent development.

It is to construct, own, and operate a 30MW Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) diesel power plant on a build-own-and-operate (BOO) basis in Port-au-Prince.  The project will sell its capacity and electricity to the state-owned utility, Electricité dHaiti (EDH), under a 15-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA).  The project benefits from sovereign guarantee and tax and duty exemptions under a Implementation Agreement (IA) and a Sovereign Guarantee with the Republic of Haiti.   	The project will be undertaken on a quasi full-turnkey basis by Hyundai Heavy Industries, Co. Ltd (HHI) and its spin-off, DECCO Ltd (DECCO) of Korea.  The foreign sponsor, the Basic Energy Group (BEG), will be the operations and maintenance (O&M) operator.   Fuel will be sourced from a large international fuel supplier.  Total project costs are about $50 million to be financed on a 75:25 debt to equity basis.  Construction period is expected to be about 18 months.  	The project is the first private-sector generation project in the country, which has been selected on the basis of international tendering processes undertaken with the help of the World Bank.  Currently, the country relies largely on another private-sector generator which owns and runs Light Fuel Oil (LFO) diesel facilities.  Being a HFO diesel facility, the Project will be significantly more cost-competitive than the existing LFO facilities at a total electricity cost of about US¢ 15-17 per kWh as compared with US¢ 22-26 per kWh for the LFO facilities at about a crude oil price of about US$ 60 -80 per bbl. 		In light of the current dire financial conditions of the state-owned utility, the project is expected to be paid largely through the budgetary transfer from the government, as has been the case for all the other private-sector generation projects.  Such budget transfer accounted for about 7-8% of total government expenditures in the recent years.  This is expected to remain at about the same level even with the commencement of the Project and other projects currently in the pipeline, assuming no improvement in the cash recovery rate of the state-owned utility and continuing growth of government budgets in line with its recent trend","","","","","",Economic Rate of Return:The project was based on an economic cost-benefit analysis.

Proper disposal of urban solid wastes is critical to maintaining and improving urban environmental and social (E&S) quality. This requires that adequate landfill capacity be available near urban areas. The Project supports the expansion of existing landfills and development of new landfills which will provide additional available capacity to dispose of urban municipal and industrial solid waste.Mitigate Adverse Impacts from Non-Sanitary Disposal. Only around 39% of the municipal solid waste collected in Brazil is disposed of in sanitary landfills. The rest is disposed of in open dumps or in landfills without adequate protection against adverse environmental and social impacts. Modern, sanitary landfills, such as the ones developed and managed by Estre, provide substantial environmental and social benefits compared to traditional solid waste destinations.Contribute to GHG Reductions. Estre expects the five existing landfills that it owns and operates in Brazil to generate 3.1 million CERs through the capture and flaring of landfill gas. The Company plans to install and operate LFG collection and flaring systems at all its new landfills, and where feasible, use the LFG to generate electricity.Increase Renewable Energy Supply. Estres Investment Plan includes the installation of a 9MW and 3MW LFG-fired power plant at two of its landfills. Besides supplying additional energy into the Brazilian grid and thus helping meet growing electricity demand, the two projects will generate power from a renewable source of energy.

A successful project of this size would likely spur significant additional global mining interest in Colombia, particularly valuable at a time when Colombia has demonstrated considerable progress in addressing security issues and political risk and is well positioned for continued economic success.IFC has identified Colombia as a primary target for mining investment because of the potential for substantial development impact from the mining sector.  This would be IFCs first mining investment in Colombia.A mine development of the expected size could have substantial impact on the local communities, not only through direct employment and services, but also from government royalties and taxes that flow back directly to local municipalities.  It is estimated that 97% of the royalties will flow back directly to the region, with 87% of total royalties flowing to the municipality level.  The Government of Colombia and oil and gas companies have been working with IFC on a pilot municipal level royalty management and capacity building program in the petroleum sector.  The Government of Colombia, the Ministry of Mines, and mining associations have expressed interest in expanding this program to the mining sector.  The two municipalities where the project is located could be part of any second pilot program, further ensuring greater development benefits to the local communities. IFCs proposed investment will fund the completion of a BFS and ESIA, which will be used as the basis by which a decision for mine development will be made.  The immediate development impacts from this investment will be limited.  However, in the event that the mine goes forward, it is currently estimated that the Angostura project will generate approximately 1,500 direct jobs during the construction phase and approximately 500 during operations.  It is currently estimated that approximately four indirect jobs will be created for each direct job created in the mine. The majority of the new jobs would be for local residents from the California municipality and for Colombian engineers from the region; one of the leading engineering schools in the country is located in the city of Bucaramanga, which is close to the mining site.  The company is working with local technical institutes to train local people for future employment at the expected mine.","","A part of the benefits of a future mine development will come in the form of taxes and royalties that will be paid to government (part of which will be distributed to local level).  The IFC has considered the risks to these benefits and, given its assessment of the Government capacity to effectively use these revenues (including the potential for engagement in programs at the municipal level), believes that on balance this is a project it should support.  The company has agreed to disclose publicly in Colombia its payments to governments at the state and local level.The World Banks Mining Policy Division is in discussions with the Government of Colombia regarding participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) program.","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

EAIF Limited,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Africa,Africa Region,EMERGING AFRICA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2009-02-18T05:00:00Z,2009-03-20T04:00:00Z,FI,Loan,"The Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund Limited ('EAIF' or the 'Fund') is a Public Private Partnership able to provide long-term USD or EUR denominated debt or mezzanine finance on commercial terms to finance the construction and development of private infrastructure in 45 countries across sub-Saharan Africa. 

The Fund was initially structured in 2002 in three tranches with total capitalization of $305 million:

- an equity tranche consisting of $100 million which was contributed by the Private Infrastructure Development Group ('PIDG'); 
- a subordinated tranche of $85 million, contributed by Development Financial Institutions ('DFIs'); and 
- a senior tranche of $120 million contributed by DFIs and commercial banks. The senior tranche was refinanced and increased to $180 million in 2006 creating a Fund size of $365 million.

The project entails increasing the size of the Fund from $365 million to $600 million, which EAIF proposes to finance with $50 million of additional equity from PIDG Trust and $185 million of additional debt to be provided by IFC, commercial banks and other DFIs.","","","","","","Globally, infrastructure is central to economic growth, improved living standards, and broader development. Investments in infrastructure projects, such as power, water and transport, have direct impacts on improving quality of life and enabling local economic development.  

In the last 15 years, on average about $10 billion a year has been spent on infrastructure in sub Saharan Africa, of which only about 30% was private sector investment and half of that was in the telecommunications sector. It is widely recognized that in order to achieve a reasonable growth rate Africa should be spending at least $20 billion a year. This additional investment cannot all be funded by the public sector and for this reason emphasis is being placed by the WBG and other donors on developing Public Private Partnerships ('PPPs').  If the development of a larger number of PPPs is successful, very large amounts of additional long term private sector debt will be required.   The project is another of the building blocks necessary to achieve increased involvement of the private sector in the development of infrastructure projects. Higher private sector financing catalyzed will free public sector capital for investment in other priority sectors.  The project also supports the expansion of a highly successful Fund which has already demonstrated its ability to originate and book commitments for projects in Africa, not only alongside existing DFIs in larger projects, but more recently and increasingly on a sole mandate basis with smaller clients.

The development impact of the project is thus captured in terms of the amount of private investment mobilized into productive infrastructure, the expansion of access to infrastructure made available by project investments, and the quality of those investments and the role of the Fund in extending appropriate environmental and social standards.","","","","","This project has been classified as a Category FI project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.The applicable requirements as determined by IFC are, implementation of:- The IFC FI Exclusion List, - The applicable Social and Environmental Laws and regulations, and- The IFC Performance Standards (PS).IFC will also review the capacity of EAIF and SIFMA to manage social and environmental risks and to establish and maintain a Social & Environmental Management System (SEMS).

PIDG's objective is to encourage private infrastructure investment in developing countries that contributes to economic growth and poverty reduction. Since its establishment, the PIDG has developed project development facilities focused on improving project development and execution (InfraCo and DevCo) and project financing vehicles (GuarantCo and EAIF), aimed at addressing financial market failures that have created constraints to private investment in infrastructure service provision. GuarantCo which provides local currency guarantees to infrastructure projects in low-income countries to mitigate credit risks for local lenders is also managed by EAIF's fund manager. 
PIDG's current members include: the UK Department for International Development ('DFID'), the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs ('SECO'), the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs ('DGIS'), the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency ('SIDA'), the Austrian Development Agency ('ADA'), Irish Aid and the World Bank.

Key environmental, health and safety, human resources and social issues in a project in this industry sector include the following:1. PS1- Social and Environmental Assessment and Management Systems  CentroMedico Puerta de Hierro (CMPDH) has implemented a systematic approach to management of internal affairs, environmental and occupational health and safety, and other hospital management considerations.  CMPDH mitigates potential impacts from hospital operations through adherence to and the institutionalization of procedures based upon regulations promulgated by the ministries of Environment, Health and Civil Protection.  Thus, for example environmental health and safety procedures are oriented to energy savings, minimization of water consumption, management of dangerous wastes in accordance with Mexican regulations, and ongoing monitoring programs.  CMPDHs existing hospital at Zapopan originally planned to establish and operate a formal quality management system that met the requirements of ISO 9001:2000 and certification was to be obtained as part of the previous investment.  After consideration of the benefits of ISO versus more health care oriented certifications, its business model and other considerations, CMPDH decided to obtain Certificacion de Establecimientos de Atencion Medica (Health Care Institutions Certification) from the Mexican Ministry of Health as well to seek Joint Commission International (JCI) certification.  The JCI assesses health care organizations to determine compliance with a strict a set of standards and requirements designed to improve quality of care.  CMPDHs Zapopan Hospital will receive its Health Care Institutions Certification in February 2009 and will obtain JCI certification in accordance with the attached environmental action plan (EAP).  CMPDH will transfer and adapt the existing Mexican government-certified management system to the new hospitals at Colima and Tepic once construction is complete and each is in operation.  Subsequently, both hospitals will obtain the Mexican Ministry of Health certification in accordance with the attached Environmental Action Plan (EAP).  CMPDH does not currently hold meetings with stakeholders to inform them of hospital operations and upcoming activities seek their input and provide them with a grievance mechanism to air complaints about hospital operations and other concerns.  CMPDH will develop an active program for the two new hospitals and prior to the commencement of construction will institute an active and ongoing program to keep host communities informed and facilitate receipt and response to all community grievances.   2. PS2  Labor and Working Conditions - CentroMedicos Human Resources (HR) policy and procedures principally address acquisition and placement of new employees.  Subcontracted employees are required to comply with CMPDH procedures and policies applied to permanent CMPDH employees.  The human resource policy and existing procedures are incomplete in terms of labor transparency requirements, employee grievances, and participation in organized labor organizations and associated issues stipulated in this performance standard.  CMPDH will revise its human resources policy to incorporate missing elements described in performance standard 2 in accordance with the attached Environmental Action Plan (EAP).   CMPDH provides diverse training to ensure professional capacity and active occupational safety and health prevention and response programs.  These programs are subject to the oversight of the Secretaría de Salud (Ministry of Health).  Moreover, labor safety and disease prevention programs, which consist of the following elements, are well developed.  When new employees have signed the labor contract, they must provide a current medical certificate including required laboratory test results.  Employees assigned to critical areas including neonatal intensive care, pediatric and adult intensive care, operating theatres, dialysis, etc. as well as in nutrition and food services participate in epidemiological surveillance for specifically notifiable diseases. All employees receive Hepatitis B vaccination.  In addition, all employees participate in accident prevention training, and all accidents are reported the appropriate regulatory agency.  Infectious and contagious disease patients are isolated in accordance with internal and Ministry of Health requirements.  CMPDH submits a weekly report to the Ministry of Health detailing new cases of specifically notifiable diseases (monitored in the epidemiological survey) and nosocomial disease.  In addition, CMPDH provides specialized training and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for employees handling infected clothing, linens and hazardous health care waste.  3. PS 3 Pollution Prevention and Abatement  CFE the Mexican electrical authority provides electric power from the national grids Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) to a principal substation for distribution to dry transformers for each building.  Engine-driven generators will provide standby electric power and these will be isolated adequately to prevent local noise impacts.   To conserve energy, internal lighting will consist predominantly of fluorescent fixtures.  CMPDH operating procedures address minimization and recycling of non hazardous waste such as wood, plastics, paper, and cardboard.   Current plans include centralized control for lighting and equipment to avoid consumption of energy by unused equipment and lighting.  The control system facilitates custom programming and facilitates data collection and trends in electric power consumption.  Each host municipality will provide potable water and each hospital will provide further treatment consisting of filtration and softening to ensure the potability of water for hospital operations and critical applications.  Both hospitals will discharge sanitary wastewater to public sewerage under permit that municipal government-owned treatment works will treat and disinfect.      Hospital staff segregates wastes from hospital operations into one of the following classifications: municipal solid waste, dangerous biological or infectious waste [biological, infectious waste (RPBI)] and hazardous waste.  All wastes are collected for off site management.  RPBI is collected in red bags by especially trained staff with appropriate PPE and then transported to temporary storage designed and built for such wastes.   Red bag waste is stored in a low temperature chamber, which staff clean daily, and remains locked.  CMPDH contracts RPBI collection and disposal to Sterimed SA CV a company licensed by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment for this service.  Sterimed collects RPBI daily and provides CMPDH with a manifest for collected waste.  Similarly, staff accumulates pathological wastes as well as sharps in yellow bags collected for disposal by Sterimed SA CV.  Gen Industrial SA CV, certified by the Ministry of Environment for this service, collects and disposes of municipal solid waste and hazardous health care waste (segregated into specialized containers), and also provides manifests addressing collection and destruction.  4. PS4  Community Health Safety and Security  CMPDH will engage the services of life and fire safety engineering professionals to review the design of both new hospitals to ensure compliance with IFC life and fire safety requirements addressed in the General EHS guideline.  In addition, after completion of construction, the life and fire safety design professional will inspect each building to ensure that the responsible contractor constructed the facility in accordance with the design.  As described above, CMPDH hospitals have well-developed waste management programs, employee training and internal disease prevention programs that aid in protection of host communities and patients.  CMPDH will develop and implement a traffic safety program for all vehicle operators associated with the hospital to reduce the frequency and severity of motor vehicle accidents.   5. PS5 Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement - CMPDH is the current owner of the two properties in Tepic and Colima designated for construction of the two new hospitals.  CMPDH acquired each property through a willing buyer-willing seller relationship.  There were no economic or physical dislocations resulting from transfer of ownership of either property.","The sponsors are the second generation of the Acosta family, a well-known family in Guadalajara with business interests mainly in bus transportation, gas station services and real estate.

Starting in 2008 the plan for Patos-Marinza includes: (i) expanded re-activation of existing Albpetrol wells and new vertical and horizontal infill drilling aimed at current proved reserves, and (ii) parallel application of additional strategies, including waterflood development and a pilot cyclic steam stimulation program to further increase oil recovery.    Bankers currently sells about half of its oil production from Patos-Marinza to ARMO, the Albanian Refining and Marketing company, including to the Ballsh and Fier refineries, and the remaining production is exported to two Italian refineries by ship from the port of Vlore. Since the 1930s the Patos-Marinza field was operated by Albpetrol, the Albanian national oil company, and its predecessor entities.  Albpetrol continue to operate in the field side by side with Bankers today.  There are approximately 2,600 existing wells and under the approved development plan Bankers has been taking over existing wells in the field step by step, starting in July 2004 when production was approximately 600 bpd from 28 producing wells.  At the time of the IFC/EBRD appraisal in June 2008, Bankers had taken over 360 wells from Albpetrol, re-activating approximately 200 of them.  In addition, Bankers has installed centralized storage and treatment facilities, and increased production to over 7,000 bpd.  Meanwhile, Albpetrol continues to work in the field and is currently operating about 200 wells on their own producing about 750 bopd from Patos-Marinza.  As Bankers progressively takes over the field, Albpetrol operations are gradually being phased out.  Ultimately, Bankers will be the sole operator at Patos-Marinza.The Patos-Marinza oilfield is heavily polluted due to limited control and treatment of wastes and emissions and considerable leakage and release of oil to the environment as a result of many years of field mismanagement and poor operational practices by Albpetrol.  Additional pollution of the area results from the activities at the nearby ARMO refineries that use old and obsolete technology in their operations that are ineffectively managed and poorly maintained.  The field is classified as one of Albanias environmental hotspots by the UNDP.  Under the Petroleum Agreement, Bankers is not liable for this legacy pollution and is only responsible for its direct field operations.  Bankers has, however, indicated its interest in supporting plans that may be developed by all stakeholders to undertake government-led wider environmental remediation activities of areas affected by Albpetrols historical operations in the field.  Bankers are at the early stages of evaluation of the Kucova oil field.  The Kucova field is located approximately 20 km to the east of Patos-Marinza and is believed to be geologically similar to Patos-Marinza.  Over 1,700 wells have been drilled in the field by Albpetrol and current production is averaging only 400 bpd.  Both oil fields have villages and small towns situated within and immediately outside their perimeters and a significant number of active and inactive Albpetrol wells are located in the immediate vicinity of peoples homes.  In Patos-Marinza an estimated 1,500 people live within 100 m of an oil well and some areas of the Kucova field are more densely settled.","","","","The review of this project consisted of appraising technical, environmental, health, safety and social information submitted by the project sponsor, and a field visit by IFC and EBRD environmental and social development specialists to Albania in June 2008.  The sites visited included the Patos-Marinza oilfield, the Kucova oilfield, and Bankers offices in Fier. Bankers staff interviewed included the General Director in Albania, the Project Services Director, and the Director of Finance and Corporate Services along with the Community Relations and Commercial Coordinator, the Environment and Civil Manager and a number of field technical engineers.  The Executive Director of the main drilling and well workover contractor was also interviewed.  In Tirana, meetings were held with the Minister for the Environment, the Director of Petroleum, the Director of the License Directory at the Albanian National Agency of Natural Resources (AKBN), and the Program Manager for Agriculture and Environment at the Delegation of the European Commission in Albania.In addition to the above, an independent environmental and social (E&S) audit of Bankers current and planned future operations was commissioned by EBRD and IFC.  The audit was conducted in order to establish the status of Bankers existing E&S mitigation and management and to provide additional recommendations to be implemented by Bankers in order to meet national and regional regulations, IFC Performance Standards and EBRD Environmental Policy requirements.Information provided and reviewed consisted mainly of documentation provided by Bankers, including a series of environmental baseline assessments of the Patos-Marinza field dating back to 1994 that have been commissioned by successive private project sponsors and produced by different independent consultants.  Bankers also provided documentation related to the Companys existing E&S management system, including plans and procedures.  This baseline information was complemented by a recent Environmental and Public Health Assessment of the wider Patos-Marinza oilfield area that was commissioned by the EU Commission and has been presented publicly.","","","","","","","","","","","","Bankers project is Category B  under IFCs Policy on Social and Environmental Sustainability and as Category B/1 under EBRD Environmental Policy.  IFCs Policy on Social and Environmental Sustainability defines a Category B project as, one that will result in limited adverse social or environmental impacts that are generally site-specific and largely reversible, and readily addressed through mitigation measures.  As discussed below activities from the Bankers project will result in limited adverse impacts that can be readily managed, but will also result in significant site specific positive impacts involving the clean up and clearance of existing contaminated well areas.Bankers project is within oilfields that already have significant adverse environmental and social impacts as a result of being heavily polluted with severe oil contamination of soils and surface waters and having a degraded airshed.  The pollution is as a result of decades of poor oilfield operational and maintenance practices by the previous field operators along with other poorly managed refining operations in the area.  However, E&S categorization is not based on the existing conditions in the field which are related to previous operations, categorization reflects the potential impacts that may result from the project development program that IFC is financing.  Impacts of the Bankers project in these existing fields are largely positive in comparison with current conditions and will contribute to the amelioration of the existing significant adverse impacts.   Bankers development program principally consists of:The intervention and re-activation of existing wells in the oil field, a program which involves the clean-up and clearance of the existing contaminated well areas and the replacement of all equipment with modern facilities in accordance with international standards.  This well re-activation program will over time result in a progressive clean-up and improvement of operations in the field to comply with good international industry practice and IFCs Performance Standards. The procurement and installation of new centralized processing facilities which are designed in accordance with international criteria and operated in compliance with good international industry practice, and which will replace old inefficient polluting equipment. A new drilling program and other strategies to enhance oil recovery that will result in a limited incremental footprint within the existing oilfield. Operations and activities will therefore result in limited site-specific impacts that can be readily managed by adhering to international standards, guidelines and international design parameters.  Importantly, Bankers progressive developments will result in a positive cumulative impact in comparison with current conditions through an incremental decrease of the pollution present and a halt to the ongoing inadequate operations by the existing operator as Bankers gradually takes over the field.","","","","",27306,"",AB - Oil and Gas Production (Includes Development),"","","",""

The Companys primary asset is the Patos Marinza heavy oilfield, in which it holds a 100% interest and right to full operatorship as it gradually takes over the field from Albpetrol, the Albanian national oil company in the next few years. In 2008, Bankers has launched a strategic plan for Patos Marinza development, aiming to increase oil recovery rates and production over the next several years through application of primary and enhanced oil recovery methods. Bankers has recently acquired 100% interest in a nearby oilfield, Kucova, development plans for which will be prepared in 2009-2010 based on the evolving economic environment. The Companys strategy is to remain focused on E&P activities in Albania.Bankers has invited IFC and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to provide a financing package to help finance the development of its Albanian assets, and in particular, the Patos Marinza development plan.","","","","","","Fit with the World Bank Group Strategy:The World Bank Groups (WBG) FY2006-2009 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Albania focuses on two key pillars: (i) continued economic growth through support to private sector development; and (ii) improving public service delivery, particularly in the social sectors.  Within the integrated WBG strategy, IFCs particular development objectives in Albania are to (i) facilitate privatization and promote private sector investments in infrastructure; (ii) promote export competitiveness of the economy through support of local export-oriented companies; (iii) improve investor confidence and help increase foreign investment inflows; and (iv)  promote market liberalization through encouraging fair practices and effective competition. The proposed investment will be closely aligned with this strategy. Development Impact:The Project is expected to generate the following development impacts:Developing domestic energy resourcesAlbania is not a major hydrocarbon producer but has possibly sizeable heavy oil reserves, which if developed with the help of advanced technologies can help increase domestic oil output. The proposed investment will help Bankers accelerate oil recovery from the Patos Marinza field (and possibly at a later stage, the Kucova field), and promote greater private investment and participation in Albanias energy sector. Attracting foreign direct investmentAlbania needs increased foreign direct investment(FDI) to develop its hydrocarbon sector, as well as other sectors of the economy.  The Companys investment in the project would make Bankers one of the countrys largest foreign investors in this sector. IFCs direct involvement will help stimulate the much needed FDI inflows in Albania. Contribution to government revenues  The project will generate substantial revenue flows to the Albanian government. The capital investment program and incremental oil production as a result of the proposed investment will result in direct economic benefits in the form of increased fiscal receipts, through income taxes (50%), royalties to the Government of Albania (10%) and Albpetrol (1-5%). Development of local skill and, technology transferMost of the staff working in the Companys operations are Albanian nationals. The Company directly employed about 200 staff in Albania at the end of 2008.  The Project is expected to contribute to further development of local skills, and transfer of knowledge and technology for heavy oil extraction, both of which will aid in the future development of the Albanian oil industry. Potential contribution to environmental remediation effortsThe Company seeks to conduct its operations in line with good international practices. Its progressive development of the field, as existing Albpetrol operations are taken over, will result in an incremental decrease of pollution and considerable clean-up in working areas, as well as reduction of health and safety risks to the communities as the initial clean-up of contaminated locations will help halt leakage from poorly abandoned equipment and ongoing pre-existing Albpetrol activities. In addition, the Company will also potentially support plans that may be developed by the public sector to undertake wider environmental remediation activities of areas affected by Albpetrols historical operations in the field, in conjunction with Albpetrol and other Albanian government agencies. IFC plans to monitor the following development impacts: (i) payments to the government; (ii) employment created / maintained; and (iii) provision of training to local staff.","","The Project is expected to contribute revenues to the Albanian Government and generate positive development benefits to local communities. Royalties and taxes from the hydrocarbon sector are paid directly to the central government budget. IFC has taken into consideration the value of potential benefits and related governance risks, and is satisfied that (i) the project should be supported and (ii) the sponsor has agreed to make project/ company payments to government public. In undertaking this assessment, IFC has reviewed existing governance assessments of Albania, including Transparency Internationals Corruption Perceptions Index and the World Bank Institutes (WBI) Governance Indicators. Albania has seen continued improvement in WBI governance indicators. The World Bank continues to have a strong presence in the country. The current Albania CAS introduced a Governance Filter for all projects, programs, policy advice and dialogue, and sectors of the economy in which the World Bank contributes to help Albanias goal of improving governance and reducing corruption. As European integration remains the main Government priority, improving governance should remain a key objective of government policies.","","","This is a Category B project because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to the applicable performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

Initially Faulu Kenya focused on micro enterprise lending in Mathare slums of Nairobi.  However, over the last 17 years, as lending methodologies and systems were improved, Faulu Kenya grew to become a company with 31 branches and a presence in most districts of Kenya.

The objective of this project is to support Faulu Kenya as it transforms from a credit only institution to a regulated deposit taking institution.  This transformation is characterized both by the development of a broader product offering as well as by the formalization of the shareholding structure and regulatory framework the institution adheres to.   The addition of liability products will provide secure savings to clients as well as more control over funding and asset liability management for the institution.  The shareholding structure will evolve, as the original NGO founder will be reduced from a majority owner to a minority shareholder, bringing a more commercial ownership and governance structure to match the more formal role Faulu Kenya will play in the financial sector.  

The proposed project consists of local currency debt (up to KSH 450 million, USD6 million equivalent) with warrants (for up to a 19.9% equity stake approximately equivalent to KSH 200 million or USD 2.7 million on a fully diluted basis).","","","","","","This project will have a high development impact considering that microfinance has been shown to play a major positive role in reducing poverty and unemployment in developing countries.

The company builds and maintains a network of telecommunications towers, and leases space on the towers to multiple GSM, fixed wireless and other providers of wireless services under long-term lease agreements.","","","","","","Expand mobile telephony access: With the construction of additional tower sites, existing mobile operators will be able to expand the reach of their services both in terms of geography and capacity. In addition, since Helios Towers is not affiliated with any operator, and as its business model is predicated on sharing and collocation, the benefits of expanded access through Helios Towers will also be available to new market entrants. Collocation reduces the incremental cost of expanding service for all carriers thereby allowing them to service remote and economically less developed areas where ARPU and usage will be lower. Increase competition: The presence of Helios Towers in the Nigerian market will allow smaller and newer wireless operators to benefit from reduced barriers to entry as they will have access to leased tower facilities rather than having to build their own.Expand access to other ICT technologies:  Helios Towers will be building a tower network that is capable of supporting not only mobile cellular networks, but also wireless broadband and backhaul networks, thereby improving the penetration of these technologies.Contribute to mitigating environmental impact and Climate Change: This project will provide a cost effective opportunity to telecommunication operators to reduce their carbon emission footprint by sharing infrastructure. A significant benefit of sharing tower infrastructure arises from the material, energy and emissions savings that ensue from building only one tower instead of three or four.  The most immediate impact is on the visual environment, where the removal of two or three unnecessary towers creates an immediate visual benefit. The savings in resources are more significant, as only one-third or one quarter of the steel, concrete and other building materials are necessary for a shared tower. Finally, in areas of uncertain power supply like Nigeria, the ability to use only one back-up power generator to serve an area where there would formerly be 3 or 4 back-up power generators for separate towers, results in immediate and continuing reduction of harmful emissions.","","","","","The key issues associated with the project are environmental, health, safety, and social management; construction of towers; labor and working conditions (including employee and contractor occupational health and safety); pollution prevention and abatement; and biodiversity conservation.

The Company is 75% owned by the Hub Power Company Limited (HUBCO), which owns and operates the first thermal power Independent Power Producer plant (the 1,292 MW Hub Power Station) in Pakistan, supported by the World Bank in 1990s.  The Jhelum River is classified as an International Waterway and governed by The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960.   In accordance with IFCs Policy on Social and Environmental Sustainability (April 30, 2006), IFC, on February 17, 2009 sent riparian notices to the IFC Executive Directors for both, India and Pakistan notifying them of IFCs proposed investment in the Project and its location in AJ&K, the Pakistan-administered portion of an area over which India and Pakistan have been in dispute since 1947. By supporting the project, IFC does not intend to make any judgment on the legal or other status of any disputed territories or to prejudice the final determination of the parties'' claims.  No objections have been received by either of the Executive Directors for India and Pakistan.All project works are located in the flood plain of the Jhelum River approximately 7 km downstream of the Mangla Dam, a major multi-purpose water storage project commissioned in 1967, and adjacent to irrigation works that were completed in 1910 (the Bong and Upper Jhelum canals). The Project will not involve the construction of a dam or reservoir nor will it affect existing water management regimes.  It will withdraw water released from the existing Mangla Dam and return that water to the main stem of the Jhelum River through a 7.5 km tailrace constructed in a sub-channel of the Jhelum.  Water release from the Mangla Dam is managed by the Indus River System Authority.  As a run-of-river project, the Project is not expected to affect upstream or downstream hydrology of the Jhelum River and is unlikely to cause any significant, lasting environmental and social impacts.  The Project includes an in-out connecting arrangement with the double circuit 132 kVA Mangla/Kharian transmission line, which passes over the project site.  No right-of-way acquisition is needed since connection facility will be built within the project site.

The Mangla Dam is being raised by the national Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) to increase storage capacity (Mangla Dam Raise Project).  The Mangla Dam Raise Project will provide better regulated water to the Project, however, both projects are not mutually dependent, and therefore, the Mangla Dam Raise Project has not been considered an associated facility to the Project.The Project was registered as a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project by CDM Executive Board under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on January 31, 2009.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Islamic Development Bank and two local commercial banks (National Bank of Pakistan and Habib Bank Limited) approved financing to the Project in 2007.  At the request of the Company, IFC and Proparco (Société de Promotion et de Participation pour la Coopération Economique) are planning to provide additional financing to support the Project.  The Project will be Pakistans first IPP project in the hydropower sector.  Through its development of the Project, LEL has broken the ground and established a framework that is expected to be replicated for future hydro IPP projects in Pakistan.The Company has conducted updated environmental and social assessment to demonstrate that the Project is being designed in accordance with the IFCs Performance Standards on Social and Environmental Sustainability (April 30, 2006).","","","","IFCs appraisal consisted of: 1) a review of project documentation, including a series of environmental and social assessments prepared for the host government authorities, the Asian Development Bank and IFC by the company and its consultants; 2) discussions with Company management regarding the projects development and design, Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contracting arrangements during the projects construction phase, and Operations and Maintenance (O&M) contracting arrangements during the projects operation phase; and 3) meetings in Islamabad, Pakistan with company management, engineers and community liaison personnel, and with the Companys Environment and Social consultants.

Laraib Energy,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Active,Middle East and North Africa,Pakistan,LARAIB ENERGY LIMITED,Regional Industry INF MCT,2009-04-02T04:00:00Z,2009-05-04T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"IFC is proposing an investment in Laraib Energy Limited (LEL, the Company), which will develop and operate a 84 MW greenfield, run-of-river hydroelectric power generating complex known as the New Bong Escape Hydroelectric Power Complex (the Project) on the Jhelum River in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJ&K), Pakistan.  The company is 75% owned by the Hub Power Company Limited (HUBCO), which owns and operates the first thermal power Independent Power Producer plant (the 1,292 MW Hub Power Station) in Pakistan, supported by the World Bank in 1990s.  The Jhelum River is classified as an International Waterway and governed by the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960.  In accordance with IFCs Policy on Social and Environmental Sustainability (April 30, 2006), IFC, on February 17, 2009 sent riparian notices to the IFC Executive Directors for both, India and Pakistan notifying them of IFCs proposed investment in the Project and its location in AJ&K, the Pakistan-administered portion of an area over which India and Pakistan have been in dispute since 1947. By supporting the project, IFC does not intend to make any judgment on the legal or other status of any disputed territories or to prejudice the final determination of the parties'' claims.  No objections have been received by either of the Executive Directors for India and Pakistan.All project works are located in the flood plain of the Jhelum River approximately 7 km downstream of the Mangla Dam, a major multi-purpose water storage project commissioned in 1967, and adjacent to irrigation works that were completed in 1910 (the Bong and Upper Jhelum canals). The project will not involve the construction of a dam or reservoir nor will it affect existing water management regimes.  It will withdraw water released from the existing Mangla Dam and return that water to the main stem of the Jhelum River through a 7.5 km tailrace constructed in a sub-channel of the Jhelum.    Water released by the Mangla Dam is managed by the Indus River System Authority.  As a run-of-river project, the project is not expected to affect upstream or downstream hydrology of the Jhelum River and is unlikely to cause any significant, lasting environmental and social impacts.  The project includes an in-out connecting arrangement with the double circuit 132 kVA Mangla/Kharian transmission line, which passes over the project site.  No right-of-way acquisition is needed since connection facility will be built within the project site.  The project will use the water being discharged from the upstream existing hydropower plant (1,000 MW Mangla Hydroelectric Power Station) located at Mangla Dam.  The Mangla Dam is being raised by the national Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) to increase storage capacity (Mangla Dam Raise Project).  The Mangla Dam Raise Project will provide better regulated water to the Project, however, both projects are not mutually dependent, and therefore, the Mangla Dam Raise Project has not been considered an associated facility to the project.The project was registered as a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project by CDM Executive Board under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on January 31, 2009.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Islamic Development Bank and two local commercial banks (National Bank of Pakistan and Habib Bank Limited) approved financing to the Project in 2007.  At the request of the company, IFC and Proparco are planning to provide additional financing to support the project.","","","","","","The project is expected to have high economic and developmental impact as it will: - Create a framework for hydro IPPs and have a strong demonstration effect (standards, procedures and document prototypes established in this project are expected to be replicated in other hydro projects in the pipeline);- Reduce the level of very costly un-served electricity and meet incremental demand for power, thereby encouraging economic growth; - Contribute to increase the countrys much needed installed capacity using a domestic renewable resource, thereby increasing energy security of supply;- Contribute to lowering the average economic cost of power generation in Pakistan; - Have significant environmental benefits compared to alternative thermal power options in terms of displacing greenhouse gas emissions (estimated reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is about 220,000 ton CO2 equivalent per year); - Create jobs (around 350 to 500 skilled and unskilled jobs) during the Project construction phase and on an ongoing basis for the O&M contractor (60); andReduce reliance on imported fuel oil, thereby not impacting the countrys trade and current account deficits.","","","","","This is a category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts that may result will be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

PT Indonesia Infrastructure Finance Facility,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Active,East Asia and the Pacific,Indonesia,PT INDONESIA INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE,"Global Industry, Financial Markets",2009-04-08T04:00:00Z,2009-06-18T04:00:00Z,FI,Equity,"Indonesia has made significant progress since the Asian Financial crisis and is enjoying robust economic growth but the infrastructure sector never fully recovered.  Public infrastructure investments dropped from a high of $10 billion in 1994 to less than $5 billion in 2002.  Currently, infrastructure investments amount to just 3 percent of GDP  the World Bank estimates Indonesias infrastructure investment needs at  7-9% of GDP.  Private investment in infrastructure declined particularly sharply  from approximately 2 percent of GDP in the mid-1990s to around 0.4 percent in 2003-04.  Infrastructure is seen as a critical constraint on economic growth in Indonesia but a series of attempts to lure back the private investors, many of them foreign, which had driven infrastructure investment in the early 1990s, has failed.  The Government of Indonesia (GoI) has now launched a broad range of measures to attract private, particularly domestic, investment to infrastructure.  An important element of this effort is the development of domestic capacity to finance infrastructure PPPs by complementing existing domestic financial institutions rather than incurring the sort of contingent liabilities to private investors which so burdened Indonesias public finances after the Asian crisis.  This project, the Indonesian Infrastructure Finance Facility (IIFF) is the center-piece of this effort.GoI has decided to establish a new, specialized lending institution offering long term, mainly local currency, financing for infrastructure, IIFF, incorporated under the name P.T. Sarana Pendanaan Infrastruktur Indonesia (SPII).   This initiative is being actively supported by the World Bank which has provided considerable advice on the general shape IIF should take.  GoI has also sought IFCs participation in IIFF, both as a signal to other investors on the viability of this initiative and as a source of technical guidance and commercial experience for this specialized venture.IIFF is being established as a commercial financial institution, to mobilize domestic currency financing of appropriate tenor, terms and price for creditworthy infrastructure projects by: (i) using its good credit rating to borrow from domestic institutional investors and banks looking for long-term placements with risk margins higher than sovereign and large corporate offerings, and by (ii) providing financial products which meet the needs of infrastructure PPP and wholly private projects.  IIFF will be a non-bank financial intermediary with the capacity to assess infrastructure projects and with the long-term liabilities to match a portfolio of long-term assets.  It is expected to focus on long-term senior and subordinated debt and minority equity positions, but its range of products is likely to broaden to credit enhancements, securitizations, and other mechanisms to promote infrastructure investment.IIF will operate as a commercial entity, with market-based rates and fees.  It will respond to market demand, and adhere to international best practices on corporate governance, operating policies and risk management; providing Indonesia with much needed infrastructure financing expertise.  GoI has embedded this concept in its policy statements on IIFF and it will be reflected in the structure and governance of the institution.","","","","","","The bottleneck which inadequate infrastructure constitutes for the Indonesian economy is recognized.  Attempts to regenerate the interest which international industry investors showed in the 1990s, have not succeeded and the public sector can only provide a fraction of what is needed.  There is a lack of market mechanisms to provide funding in the volumes, structures and maturities needed and there are regulatory constraints and a lack of capacity in both Government and the financial sector, to shape bankable private infrastructure projects.  IIFF will strengthen this capacity, provide a channel for domestic financial institutions to invest in infrastructure and make appropriate long-term financing available for well structured projects.  If it succeeds in linking domestic savings to new private infrastructure investment, the potential development impact is very significant.  By raising infrastructure investment in Indonesia, IIFF is expected to have a positive impact on economic growth.  Moreover, investments in infrastructure projects, such as power, water and transport, have direct impacts on improving quality of life and enabling local economic development.  To the extent that IIFF issues long-term bonds in the domestic market, it will improve the supply of long-term securities for institutional investors who currently face a severely limited range of high quality long-term papers in local currency.","","","","","This project has been classified as a Category FI project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

The initiative takes a long, term programmatic approach to improve the lives of Palestinian families living in unsafe, substandard or severely cramped housing conditions in West Bank and Gaza.   The program would combine the provision of technical assistance for the development of the overall mortgage market in Palestine and the availability of long term mortgages that would be designed to make home ownership affordable to target segments of the Palestinian population. A mortgage servicing company AMAL would be formed to perform certain master servicing and other functions related to the project.","","","","","","
The Development Impact of this project is likely to be high.  The specific development impacts of this project would be:

Significant improvement to the enabling environment for the creation of a viable housing finance market in West Bank.  Institutional and legal constraints today create major obstacles to mortgage lending.  It is expected that the removal of such obstacles particularly registration of titles, difficulty of foreclosures will encourage lenders to come into the market and scale up their lending programs.

Access to finance for middle and low income individuals.  The project will make affordable, long term home finance available to a significant number of people in the low and middle income brackets.  The homes financed will help improve the living standards of the borrowers as they get access to safe and more spacious housing as compared to the overcrowded and cramped conditions they currently face.  The longer term of the mortgages to be provided under the program will play a major role in making homes more affordable by reducing the monthly payments to a level that could be serviced by a broader segment of the population.

Boost to the construction sector:  Although the program is intended to fund only mortgages and not construction, the creation of effective demand by the financing available under the program will encourage developers to take a more active approach in developing their projects as the risk to them will be reduced by an increase in the number of  potential buyers.  The program may include financing of progress payments for booking of units in multifamily housing developments in the construction phase.

Restarting the mortgage market.  As the program will be making mortgages under a difficult environment, it would be sending a positive signal to other institutions.  The success of the project would encourage other entities to come into this market and help build a more sustainable housing finance market in West Bank.","","","","","","The principal sponsor of the project is the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC).

The project will increase global trade flows in the grain sector and increase grain exports from Ukraine. It will also create more competition between traders and this will ultimately benefit farmers. The project is expected to positively impact the following stakeholders: - Farmers: The project is expected to reach a minimum of 500 farmers and therefore a large number of employees and land owners. The project will benefit farmers as it will expand the number of buyers, create competition for farmers output and thereby allowing farmers to sell their output at the best price. NWGU will be among the buyers who would compete for grain on the local market.  - SME Development: NWGU hires local contractors to transport grains from farms and collection centers to storage facilities. The number of transportation trips and contracts are likely to increase significantly. It also employs a number of service companies (inspection, port, etc) that are essential to grain trade. - Customers: by improving the efficiency of the local supply chain, NWGU will improve the cost structure which can help ease price pressures on key commodities (wheat, barley).

The water temperature is 40 C. If it is brought down to 30 C, as designed, the batch times would be reduced due to faster cooling and hence energy used in agitation, centrifuge and pumping would be reduced. Additionally, cooling water circulation rate would reduce and one cooling water circulation pump can be shut off. Also, by isolating the tower that takes water from vacuum pumps, any solvent contamination can be restricted to that tower only and can be easily treated.Solvent Recovery from reactors and waste water can be improved by a more efficient process of chilling vapor at normal pressure.","","","","","This investment is designed to reduce the energy, water and solvent consumption of Granules manufacturing processes.

The appraisal also included a visit to the existing QICT facilities and the adjacent Phase II construction site.","","","","","","","","","","","","The expansion will take place on the existing site, in an area outside of Karachi designated for light industrial and port operations.  As a result, only minor E&S impacts associated with some marginally additional activities are anticipated, covering issues such as labor policies and performance during construction and operation; maintenance dredging and dredge spoil disposal; liquid, solid and hazardous waste disposal; oil/hazardous materials storage and handling; handling and storage of dangerous cargoes; ship support operations, fueling services and spill response; employee health, safety and training programs; and emergency response planning and preparedness.  Existing facility E&S performance has been well managed.The existing facility is well managed and monitored against relevant international certification standards (ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001). The expansion will take place on the existing site, in an area outside of Karachi designated for light industrial and port operations.  The parent company, DP World, is a large and reputable ports management company, and IFCs visit to the QICT operations confirmed that there are robust systems in place to manage and monitor E&S and labor issues. The projects impacts are therefore not expected to be diverse, irreversible or unprecedented, resulting in the Category B designation.","","","","",27930,"",BB - Port and Harbor Operations,"","","",""

Potential impacts that could result from the actual milling operation, e.g., dust explosion and food contamination, will be effectively addressed by means of internal management systems such as Bakhresas safety program and a HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points) food safety program.The development will occur in an area designated for industrial development and all the potential impacts are generally site specific and none are regarded to be significant.  Further, grain milling is in itself a low impact activity that results in limited wastes.  Bakhresa have extensive experience in the business line and propose constructing an ultra modern facility including a dust collection and reuse system and energy efficiency measures  Thus, this is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because the limited number of specific impacts that may occur are site specific, and those impacts can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, programs, procedures, guidelines or design criteria.","","","","",28127,"",AA - Grains and Beans,"","","",""

The Project involves the construction of a copper and cobalt processing plant and associated facilities in Katanga province of DRC for the re-treatment of processed oxide tailings from the Kolwezi concentrator. The Kolwezi deposit was first mined in the 1950s.  Due to the poor recovery rates obtained at the time, valuable amounts of copper and cobalt were discharged into the tailings dams. The Project company is Kingamyambo Musonoi Tailings SARL (KMT). First Quantum Minerals Ltd, the new sponsor following the take-over of Adastra Minerals, owns 65% of KMT and as such is primarily responsible for constructing the project.  IFC contributed with equity funding during the first phase of this Project, approved by IFC Board on May 12, 2005, which involved the preparation of a bankable feasibility study, and has a 7.5% equity stake in KMT. Other shareholders of KMT are the DRC government 5%, Gécamines 12.5%, and the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) of South Africa 10%. The KMT concession area (Tailings Exploitation Area, TEP), where re-processing operations will be conducted, is located north of Kolwezi town and north-east of and adjacent to mine workings associated with another concession.  The TEP was awarded for an initial period until May 2022 and is automatically renewable. The license area covers 6 100 hectares and extends 13.75 km from north to south and up to 9km from east to west. The Kingamyambo Tailings Dam is a conventional tailings facility which contains 42 million tons of tailings and covers an area of 3 km2 with an average height of 20 m.  The Musonoi River tailings deposit contains over 71 million tons of tailings over an area 11 km long and up to 2.5 km wide. The Kingamyambo and Musonoi tailings deposits will be mined simultaneously to achieve the required grade and grain size distribution. The current project initially plans to mine an average of 2.4 million tons of tailings per year. Mining will be through conventional hydraulic mining. The Kingamyambo tailings will be reclaimed utilizing high pressure monitors. Reclamation of the Musonoi tailings will be by two principal techniques. Initially, the tailings will be recovered by dredging, with hydraulic monitors replacing the dredgers once the dredgeable portion has been exhausted. Monitored tailings will gravitate to a pump station for transfer to the treatment plant. As the Musonoi tailings are located in the Musonoi River, a river diversion will be necessary during mining. The process plant will involve the extraction of the residual metals by a leaching process followed by solvent extraction (SX) and electro-winning (EW) to produce cathode copper of 99.9%, and cobalt hydroxide. In time, cobalt metal of 99.8% will be produced. Key process plant infrastructure includes i) an electrode boiler, ii) a sulfur burning acid plant, iii) a limestone milling plant; iv) offices and workshops; v) finished product storage; vi) spares storage;  and vii) a parking. Initial plant throughput will be ± 2.4 million tons per annum (tpa), resulting in estimated production of 35 000 tpa copper and 7 000 tpa cobalt hydroxide. Key project infrastructure will include a Tailings Storage Facility (TSF), power lines, a borehole field for process water supply, a processing plant, a dedicated construction camp, a permanent management housing complex, a domestic landfill and new site access roads. The project will employ approximately 1,300 persons during construction and approximately 660 persons during operations. Project life based upon existing tailings reserve and production estimates is likely to be 17-23 years. Construction began in November 2007 and is currently underway under previous approvals provided by the Government of DRC. Earthworks are almost complete and civil works are roughly half finished. Site access roads have been completed, most senior management houses have been built, contractor camps and associated canteens and ablution areas being utilized, the administration offices are largely complete and the plant is half built. A vegetable garden and indigenous nursery have been started, as have various borrow pits, and construction and domestic waste areas have been established. The TSF footprint has been largely cleared and earthworks have begun on the starter wall. It is likely that construction will be completed in early 2010 and that first copper will be poured in the second quarter of 2010.","","","","IFC made an equity investment in the Kolwezi Tailings Project in May 2005. Thereafter, IFC environmental and social development specialists spent considerable time with Adastra  the original Sponsor  to ensure that adequate Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) documentation was prepared for the main construction and operations phase (Kolwezi II, this project). Multiple meetings and site visits were held in Johannesburg, Kolwezi and London to ensure that the ESIA process and content would satisfy international lender requirements including, after 2006, IFC Performance Standards. As a shareholder, IFC collaborated with Adastra to co-sponsor two successful and well-attended capacity building workshops in Lubumbashi and Kolwezi (DRC) in May 2006 focusing on good mining environmental practices and local stakeholder engagement. Following First Quantum Minerals Ltds (FQMs) take-over of the Kolwezi Project at that time, there was a hiatus in ESIA development as the new owners re-evaluated the project scope and design. Subsequently, IFC specialists met with FQM in Johannesburg in December 2007 to discuss the scope and nature of ESIA updates required to meet IFC requirements, in accordance with the updated project design. Further meetings with FQM and SRK Consulting followed, in Ndola (Zambia), Lubumbashi and Kolwezi in the first quarter of 2008, including an IFC site visit in February 2008 to view early construction activities. IFC undertook a further site visit at the end of March 2009 in order to obtain a project update and to re-engage with key stakeholders. IFC has also been privy to the results of a recent Equator Principle review process initiated by commercial institutions potentially interested in supporting the project.","","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category A project according to IFCs Environmental & Social Review Procedure as it will result in a number of significant environmental and social impacts such as those associated with land acquisition, village resettlement, water management, effluent disposal and Tailings Storage Facility (TSF) safety.

It owns 65% of Kingamyambo Musonoi Tailings SARL (''''KMT''''), which is the project company of the Kolwezi tailings project (the Project).   The Kolwezi project involves the construction of a copper and cobalt processing plant and associated facilities to process tailings in Katanga province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).  These tailings were produced in the 1950s from mining operations that, due to the poor recovery rates obtained at the time, discharged valuable amounts of copper and cobalt resources into the tailings dam.  The Kolwezi tailings are located in two deposits  the Kingamyambo tailings dam and the Musunoi river tailings.  Currently, the dam consists of 112 million tonnes grading 1.49% copper and 0.29% cobalt (total metal content is estimated at 1,676,000 tonnes of copper and 363,000 tonnes of cobalt).  The Project will produce about 70,000tpa of copper metal and up to 14,000tpa of cobalt hydroxide.    IFC contributed about US$4.5 million in equity funding (for a 7.5% equity stake in KMT) during the first phase of this project which involved the preparation of a bankable feasibility study.  Other shareholders of KMT are; the DRC Government  5%, Gécamines (a State-owned entity)  12.5%, and the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) of South Africa  10%.","","","","","","Mining is a key sector in the DRC and has been the backbone of the Congolese economy since colonial times.  The Project would be one of the early ones to be developed since the re-launch of sustainable commercial mining activities in the DRC.  A successful project would likely spur significant additional mining interest in the DRC.  The World Bank Group is actively involved in supporting the development of a sustainable mining industry in the DRC.  The expected development impacts of the Project include:Contribution to DRCs Economy:  The Project is expected to generate considerable economic benefits in the form of fiscal payments to Government (taxes, dividends and royalties).  It is expected that the DRC government would receive about US$4.5 million annually in royalties once the Project is in production.Direct and Indirect Employment opportunities for Local Community:  The Project is expected to create over 1,300 direct jobs during the construction phase and over 660 direct full-time jobs during the operational phase of which most will go to Congolese nationals.Development of infrastructure:  The Project will construct about 200 km of roads using its own resources including a new road from Kolwezi to Zambia to be used to transport final products for export.  This will stimulate the revival of infrastructure required for the transport of goods and services.Improvement of Environmental and Social Practices:  The high quality Environmental and Social (E & S) documentations produced during the feasibility study stage are regarded as the one of the most advanced in the Congolese mining sector.  It is expected that the Project will, with IFCs continued involvement, continue to set new benchmarks on environmental and social sustainability practices in the sector.  Linkages:  The Project will promote spending with local suppliers and contractors that will create jobs and stimulate economic activity.","","It is expected that a fair share of the net project benefits from the development of the Project will accrue to the Government in the form of taxes and royalties, in compliance with the Mining Code.  Notwithstanding the Governments efforts at improving governance, institutional capacity to enforce good governance at the moment is weak.  The country achieves low scores in a variety of governance assessments (World Bank Institutes Governance Indicators Country Policy and Institutional Assessment, for example). The Government is actively engaged with the World Bank (in collaboration with other development partners including GTZ and DFID) to address these governance weaknesses through a range of interventions  advisory and analytical work, technical assistance and capacity building, and finance.  The DRC also recently joined the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) as a further effort to increase transparency in the mining and forestry sectors.  In addition, KMT will publicly disclose all payments that will be made to the Government.   IFC has considered the potential benefits and risks stemming from weak governance in the DRC and has come to the view that the Project should be supported.","","","This is a Category A project according to IFC''s Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

The company, through its subsidiary Kiwara Resources (Zambia) Ltd, holds 80 % of Kalumbila Minerals Ltd, which holds Prospecting Licence 267 (PL 267 or the License Area). The project involves continued exploration at the License Area, which includes resource definition drilling and commencement of pre-feasibility studies. Kiwara is seeking IFCs engagement to help finance the companys exploration activities in line with industry best practice in environmental and social sustainability.","","","","","","The project is located in a frontier region in a rural area of Zambia with very limited employment opportunities. The proposed financing will support the companys existing workforce of 58 staff. Recent changes in Zambias mining tax regime are aimed at improving investor perception of Zambia as a good destination for mining investments. IFCs investment will demonstrate support for the mining sector which is being adversely affected by the currently low copper prices. Furthermore, the company has a very prospective nickel deposit which, if developed with IFCs assistance, would help the Zambian economy diversify away from copper dependence.Because the investment predates any feasibility study, it is not yet possible to fully quantify or specify the potential development impacts during production stage. However, potential development impacts at the mine production stage could include:- local employment and sourcing; - taxes, royalties and other payments to the government;- technology and management skills transfer; - setting new environmental and social benchmarks for mining operations in Zambia; and - development of transportation and energy infrastructure which would improve possibilities for other economic activities.","","The IFC has considered the governance risks in Zambia, e.g. effective use of revenues generated from mining operations, transparency in awarding prospecting/mining licenses, etc., and believes that on balance this is a project it should support. The Zambian government is actively engaged with the World Bank Group (WBG) to establish fiscal and macroeconomic policies to ensure that government revenues are targeted at poverty reduction goals and objectives. The Government has requested and won WBG support in assisting with EITI implementation and EITI++ scoping analysis.Kiwara is supportive of the efforts to implement good governance and transparency in the sector and will provide IFC with an undertaking that it will disclose publicly all payments made in the form of taxes, royalties, fees, etc., to the government once it begins production. The proposed investment in Kiwara provides IFC with an opportunity to support the WBGs strategy in Zambia of promoting private investments in mining in a transparent and socially sustainable way.","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards and guidelines.

In order to increase domestic demand, China needs to significantly reduce the gap between living standards in urban and frontier/rural areas.  Microfinance is one of the tools to narrow that gap and to provide, amongst other benefits, employment opportunities to factory works who may have lost their jobs in export-oriented companies located in the coastal area and who are migrating back to Chinas rural areas.The proposed project consists of equity investments of up to US$10 million in a network of 5 - 10 greenfield Village and Township Banks (VTB) in China which are sponsored by Harbin Bank (theBank). The Bank as the leading sponsor will contribute most capital and resources to the network of VTBs.  It will take an equity stake of more than 51% in each VTB and nominate the key management team.  IFC will take a 10 - 20% equity stake in these VTBs and will provide technical assistance. A VTB is effectively a deposit-taking microfinance bank, a model initiated by CBRC (the Chinese banking regulator) in 2006.  As the VTB concept is still in the pilot stage, CBRC gives a limited number of licenses to sponsoring banks which are required to take the lead in setting up VTBs in a designated county or township, and the operational scope of a VTB is clearly limited to one county or township.  The sponsoring banks could be local banks or qualified foreign banking institutions with an eligibility test as to consolidated balance sheet size reaching US$1.0 billion.  The sponsoring bank must take no less than 20% equity in a VTB and any non-banking shareholder may hold equity of up to 10%.","","","","","","As has been demonstrated over the past two decades, well-managed microfinance institutions can make major contributions to poverty reduction, improvement of standards of living and employment creation in developing countries and poorer areas.  The proposed project will enable the establishment of commercially viable VTBs that will provide sustained access to credit and other financial services for poor and rural populations, as well as microenterprises.  The project will generate a range of social and economic benefits, including economic growth and employment creation in the counties and townships where the VTBs will be established, as well as financial deepening with services and products tailored to low-income and rural populations.  The establishment of these VTBs will be very timely as it will contribute to the strengthening of rural economies, create new opportunities for workers returning to their villages after having lost their factory jobs, and help reduce the urban-rural income gap.  Furthermore, the VTBs will contribute to the fostering of entrepreneurial spirit in areas far away from Chinas economic hotspots.","","","","","The project involves IFC support for the microfinance sector, and has been classified as a Category FI project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.  Considering the nature of activities supported, each of these VTBs will be required to: Develop a procedure relevant to its business process, prior to disbursement, that is satisfactory to IFC, and that ensures that all its investments are screened and processed to avoid supporting activities on the microfinance exclusion list:- Identify qualified persons to manage and implement the procedure;- Demonstrate commitment and resources to implementing the procedure; and - Submit a periodic report to IFC as per a format to be provided by IFC","Established in February 1997, the Bank used to be a city commercial bank based in Harbin City, the provincial capital of Heilongjiang Province.  It was authorized by CBRC to expand its operations beyond Harbin City and has subsequently opened branches in Dalian, Liaoning Province and Tianjin City.  Moreover, the Bank had traditionally been focusing on large corporate clients, however, has changed its strategic approach and is now increasingly serving small and medium enterprises, rural clients and micro-entrepreneurs.  It is in this context that the Bank has embraced the VTB concept and will use VTBs as one element of its strategic reorientation.  The new business strategy has shown to be successful as demonstrated in the Banks improving financial performance.

The proposed project is located in an isolated agro-pastoral area with low population density, approximately 25 km south of Djelfa and 5 km west off the N1 highway (Route Nationale 1) connecting Djelfa and Laghouat (110 km south of the site). ASEC Cement acquired the concession to the project from the national Enterprise Regionale des Ciments du Centre (ERCC) in 2006 and transfer of assets including the project site, seven quarry concessions (the limestone quarry and six clay quarries) and other assets (two water wells, 30 KV transmission line, five villas in Djelfa) occurred in 2007. Civil works have been awarded to two contractors, ESACO (an Egyptian contractor) and MHDA (an Algerian-Egyptian contractor), and are currently underway. Construction will occur over a 36 month period and is due for completion in mid-2011. 

The proposed Project will develop two production lines and will comprise: 
(i) 2x 1,200 tons per hour (tph) limestone and clay hammer crushers; (ii) a 648 tph additives/corrective crusher; (iii) 2x 400 tph vertical roller raw mills and 2 raw meal blending silos of 20,000 tons capacity each; (v) 2x 4,500 tons clinker per day (tpd) kiln/pyro-processing system, 5 stage preheater with precalciner, designed for natural gas fuel; (vi) 2x 60,000 tons clinker silos; (vii) 3x 200 tph cement ball mills; (viii) 4x 20,000 tons cement silos; and (ix) 6x 120 tph cement packing lines.  The nominal production capacity of the two lines is 9,000 tons of clinker per day or 2.97 million tons per year (tpy) assuming a maximum 330 days of annual operation.  The proposed plant nominal production capacity is 10,170 tpd or 3.36 million tpy of a cement blend average consisting of 85% Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC, clinker/cement ratio 0.90) and 15% blended cement (clinker/cement ratio 0.80).  Assuming an effective capacity utilization of 90%, the plant capacity will correspond to 3.02 million tpy of cement effectively produced.

Energy will be supplied from national systems  the gas-fired kilns will be supplied through a 32 km gas pipeline connecting the site to the nearest distribution system; a newly constructed 220KV overhead transmission line will bring the needed electrical power from the nearest grid sub-station in Djelfa, approximately 17 km from the site. The Company will contract the responsible national agency (Sonelgaz) to construct the gas pipeline and the transmission line. Project water supplies will be drawn from the two existing wells, located at about 2 km from the plant site. Both plant operation and maintenance and quarry management and raw material supply will be outsourced. 

The limestone deposit is located in an area named Djellal El Gharbi, about 1 km northwest of the plant site.  The area is a hilly terrain at an elevation varying from 1440 meters to 1345 meters above MSL.  The limestone is massive, cavernous, partially crystalline and fossiliferous with lateral changes to marl deposits and argillaceous limestone.  The reserves have an estimated 80 years lifetime.  A crusher will be installed at the foothill of the quarry concession and the crushed material will be transported by a set of conveyor belts to a circular mix bed stockpile of 65,000 tons capacity in the cement plant area.  The five clay deposits are located at about 4.5 km southeast (Oued Essadr deposit), 78 km west (Ben Yacoub 1 and 2), and 45 km southwest (Ben Hamed 1 and 2) from the plant site.  A sixth clay deposit is located in Ben Naamane, but it is currently not included in the development plans of the company.  Clay reserves have an estimated 50 years life span.  Iron ore and gypsum will be procured from local sources and transported by road.  

The total project area is approximately 558 ha comprising the 100 ha plant site, the limestone quarry (236 ha; the Project plans to submit an application to double its size to the relevant authorities) and 5 clay quarries (222 ha), but not including the pipeline and transmission line rights-of-way (ROW), additional areas for disposal of excavation material and the temporary construction camp and batch plant area. The main land use of the limestone quarry site and elevated areas proximate to the site is for grazing of sheep by nomadic pastoralists. Most of the clay quarry sites  are used, at least in part, for seasonal cultivation of wheat. Quarry exploitation will result in economic displacement of a number of these cultivators. The most proximate communities to the plant site are those of Oued Sdar (approximately 5 km from the site) and Ain El Ebel (12 km from the site), both of which are located on the other side of the N1 highway.","","","","The environmental and social (E&S) review of the greenfield limestone quarrying and cement manufacturing Project (the 'Project') of ASEC Algeria (ASEC or the 'Company') involved:

meetings with the Sponsor (ASEC Cement, Egypt) and existing and potential contractors in Algeria and Egypt, including ASCOM (geological and raw material investigation, preparation of the mining plan), ASEC Engineering (project management and consulting) and ASEC Automation; 
visits to the plant site and the limestone and clay quarry concessions held by the project; 
a review of the cement plant's Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), plant's technical specifications and additional environmental, health and safety documentation (documents relevant to the transfer of land concessions and other assets, quarry investigations, safety plans and human resources information for the Sponsor's companies and the Project); 
consultations with ASEC Cement site management personnel; contractors engaged in civil works (MHDA and ESACO); the local consultant responsible for development of the plant's EIA (CETIM); various government representatives including the Wali of Djelfa, the Mayor of Ain El Ebel, the Djelfa Departments responsible for Environment and Energy, Industry and Mining, and community elders from Ain El Ebel and Oued Sdar.","","","","","","","","","","","","The Project is located in a relatively isolated area characterized by its low population density and limited agro-pastoral land use. The plant site is relatively far (5km) from the nearest residential areas and affected only by the presence of nomadic pastoralists.  The project affected area is part of relatively homogenous bio-physical region.  There do not appear to be any significant conversion or degradation of high biodiversity value areas although portions of the limestone quarry concession are largely undeveloped. The key environmental and social issues associated with the construction and operation of the plant are: (i) the existence of a social and environmental management system and the development of key operational phase E&S policies and plans (including a Stakeholder Engagement Plan); (ii) contractor management, including performance on PS 2, PS 3 and PS 4; (iii) traffic impacts, associated with the use of the existing access road and connections to the N1 highway and management thereof; (iv) potential economic displacement of farmers cultivating wheat on lands contained within the clay quarry concessions and in the immediate vicinity of the project; (v) groundwater protection, (vi) development of a strategy for progressive rehabilitation of the quarries, and; (vii) completion of the environmental and social assessments for all the related facilities.

As a result of its due diligence, IFC has determined that the Project has limited adverse environmental and social impacts that are few in number, site-specific and can be readily addressed through the mitigation measures described in the sections that follow.  It is therefore concluded that this is a Social and Environmental Category B project.","","","","",27920,"",AA - Cement,"","","",""

Rural electrification has been a long-time focus of the WB and IFC. Access to reliable electricity is an active catalyst for sustainable development as it can boost living standards, it can prevent rural exodus and emigration to urban areas, it can reduce mortality and improve gender quality.

The Project aims to support the progressive transformation and improvement of living conditions of the population in rural areas of Senegal which at present lack electricity (85% of the population in rural areas in 2005).  This will be achieved by (i) providing lighting and access to modern communications to rural households; (ii) improving delivery of social services with the provision of electricity for potable water systems, health clinics and schools; and (iii) enhancing economic productivity with the use of electricity for productive purposes.

Senegal's population in rural areas depends on fuel-wood for cooking, kerosene lamps and some small flashlights operating with batteries for lighting, and on human force - frequently from women - for domestic and productive tasks.  The Project has the potential of promoting growth and the personal development of women and children by making their domestic workload less heavy. In addition, the social benefits from electrification  the ability to power lights, radios, small appliances and televisions  make a significant contribution to enhancing the quality of life and to the reduction of poverty.

Improve access to electricity: 

The Project will provide electricity to 19,574 rural users in the next three years who at present do not have access to electricity, covering 298 villages.  The proposed Project will provide electricity to 213 schools and 118 health centers, thus allowing rural populations to access better education and health services.

Foster the development of local businesses and improved health services:  

The PREM subsidies will allow the Company to put in place electrical installations to increase the productivity of one SME, the Laiterie du Berger, and to improve the operations and services of 28 health centers as they will be able to preserve vaccines.  The doubling of capacity of the SME will provide extra income of US$60-80/month approximately to each of 400 additional families who will supply electricity to the Laiterie.

Supply reliable electricity using renewable energy technologies: 

The Company has opted for solar powered systems to supply electricity to certain populations located at a certain distance from the grid as electricity from these systems is more cost competitive, reliable and efficient than extending the grid to isolated populations.  Electrification with renewable energy systems provides a less polluting alternative to diesel-based generation and reduces transmission and distribution losses.  The Project will have a positive environmental impact as it will help to reduce CO2 emissions; it will also promote conservation by using renewable sources of energy (solar energy) and efficient lamps.","","","","","This is a category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects.

Antares Minerals,Investment,Environmental Documents,Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Peru,Antares Minerals Inc.,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2009-05-14T04:00:00Z,"",B,Other,"Antares Minerals Inc is a listed (TSX V.ANM) Canadian junior mining exploration company focused on the Haquira Copper (Cu) exploration project. This is located 80 km south west of Cusco (some 215 km by road), at high altitude (3800-4400 m) in the Apurimac Department of southern Peru, which is considered to be one of the poorest regions in the country. Its local subsidiary is Minera Antares Peru S.A.C. The Haquira project straddles the boundary of the Provinces of Cotabambas and Grau.  The nearest town with services is Chalhuahuacho located ~15 km east of the project camp although the small community of Huanacopampa lies next to the exploration camp. All supplies and fuel are trucked in from either Arequipa or Cuzco. An electrical sub-station is located approximately 16 km to the SE of the project. Electrical lines for limited domestic use are currently being installed to many of the small communities near the project, but are not yet activated.Minera Phelps-Dodge del Peru S.A.C. discovered the Haquira deposits and obtained all the necessary environmental and surface access agreements to undertake initial exploration activities at the Haquira project between 2001 and 2003. In 2005, Antares Minerals Inc. (Antares) (ANM-TSX.V) and Minera Phelps Dodge del Peru S.A.C. (Phelps Dodge), a wholly owned subsidiary of Phelps Dodge Corporation (PD-NYSE), executed an option agreement whereby Antares could acquire a 100% interest in the Haquira SX-EW copper project.  On July 25, 2003, Minera Phelps-Dodge filed a Category C Environmental Evaluation for the development of an exploration program consisting of the construction of 92 drill pads. The area disturbed by this exploration program was estimated to be 11.8 hectares. Phelps Dodge agreed to sell the Haquira project concessions to Antares when Xstrata Copper won the privatization bid for the adjacent Las Bambas property.The project shows potential for an open-pit copper mine operation as well as an opportunity for a potential future underground mining operation in due course.  Step out drilling and various geophysical and geological work indicates that there is considerable potential for the mineralization to continue significantly beyond the area that is the basis for the current resource estimate. At least one satellite deposit (Cristos los Andes) has been discovered some 10 km to the south and there may well be others. Any mining at Cristos los Andes would likely be processed at a central plant at Haquira. Haquira currently has an interim resource estimate (inferred and indicated, utilizing a 0.3% Cu cut-off) of 450MT sulphide ores @ 0.6-0.7% CuEQ and 175MT leachable oxide ores @ 0.5% CuEQ grade, which equals 8.6 billion lbs CuEq in ground. A pre-feasibility study of the shallow oxide ores is now underway and due for completion in 2010. There have been four separate drilling campaigns (some 275 holes) since the start of Phelps Dodge involvement. The majority of the holes were in the upper secondary copper ore zone. The discovery hole of the underlying primary porphyry at Haquira East (drill hole AHAD-097, after approximately 210 previous holes) was completed on 23 December 2006.  The hiatus between these campaigns has caused some confusion in local communities between raised expectations when drilling was taking place and feelings that they had been abandoned when drilling stopped.  Haquira has been working with local communities to explain the exploration process. Haquira is located south of and adjacent to Xstratas Las Bambas project, a large copper project which will require construction of significant infrastructure to the area. Antares also has a copper exploration project in the province of Salta (50/50 JV with Mansfield Minerals Inc.), northwestern Argentina, but the project has been put on hold and there are currently limited plans for continued exploration activities. In light of the decreased copper price, the companys strategy is to conserve the cash on hand to cost-efficiently advance scoping studies, prefeasibility and feasibility studies and continue work with the local communities to plan and prepare for future development of the project.  The Company has $10 million in cash at hand, which together with the proposed IFC investment of $5 million is expected to carry the Company to completion of the pre-feasibility study for the upper secondary copper mineralization and also significantly advance the definition of the underlying primary sulphide mineralization. 	IFC has identified Peru as a primary target for mining investment, given the substantial mineral resources, positive environment for private investment, and potential to contribute to economic development.  Perus mining sector is of vital importance to the country as it represents over 6% of GDP and last year contributed nearly 30% of the Governments tax revenues.  Mining revenues have recently been growing at more than 6% annually and are by far the countrys main export revenue source, representing 62% of the countrys total exports in 2006 ($14.7 billion).  In addition, during 2007, $1.7 billion in royalties were returned to municipalities in the mining areas, most of which are otherwise extremely poor rural areas characterized by economic stagnation, lack of government capacity, low employment opportunities and weak, underdeveloped social capital.  President Garcia has brought a change in Peru''s political and investment climate, and since mid-2007, the administration has been urging mining companies to implement sustainable mine development.  The proposed investment addresses the relevant lessons learned from other mining projects, in particular the need for a strong sponsor with proven track record and good understanding of the industry; a sponsor striving to employ environmental and social best practice; and a sponsor willing to address key HSEC issues already at exploration stage.  This project is also in line with recent IFC experience in the mining sector that has identified the value of IFC engaging early to help the sponsor manage potential environmental and social effects.The project is located in a remote frontier region of Apurimac, in a rural area of the Andes highlands with little access to basic services, widespread poverty, and almost no formal employment opportunities. Approximately 37% of the population of Apurimac is illiterate, a situation that is even more extreme in the project area. The 18 Comunidades Campesinas (Rural Andean Communities) identified by Antares as being located within the area of direct and indirect influence of the project are still very traditional in their customs and practices, and for the most part they rely on a subsistence economy, combining herding (cattle, sheep and some horses) and limited agriculture (mostly potatoes) on communally held land.  The four communities that are more directly impacted by the exploration activities are Huanacopampa, where the exploration camp is located, Ccahuanhire, Pararani, and Lahuani.Although there will be limited benefits during the exploration phase, there are potentially significant economic development benefits during any future construction and production phases, including tax revenues/foreign exchange contribution to the national and local economy as well as development of vital transportation infrastructure that will improve possibilities for other economic activities.  The proposed project directly supports the WB/IFC Strategy for Peru, namely: directly improve opportunities in rural areas; invest in sectors in which Peru has a competitive advantage; and enhance the community benefits of exploitation of non-renewable natural resources.  Peru has signed EITI.Antares has expressed its ambition to follow best practice. At the exploration stage, for a junior company it has already achieved a considerable amount in the form of community outreach programs. IFC will assist Antares in preparing a Health, Safety, Environment & Community Policy which will contain management plans through the exploration stage and commitments for any future development of a mine.","","","","IFC specialists visited the Antares Haquira project site from 30th March - 3rd April 2009, and met key Sponsor representatives. Following high-altitude safety induction (and medical tests), field visits were organized to the different exploration areas within the concession license area. Various discussions were held with members of the workforce, five community projects were visited and a discussion was held with the President of the community of Huanacopampa which lies adjacent to the exploration camp. Follow up detailed technical, E&S and financial discussions were held at the Antares Minerals Arequipa offices.  Documents reviewed have included Baseline Environmental Assessments covering air and water quality, biodiversity, noise and archaeology, as well as a Diagnostic Social Assessment and the Companys draft Community Relations Policy.  The Antares team also made three detailed PowerPoint presentations to the IFC team (General, E&S and Geology).","","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs procedures for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because the project only involves exploration and therefore has limited adverse impacts and risks which are manageable.  The key risks include control of erosion and rehabilitation of temporary roads, waste management; water management; public safety, dust control, hazardous materials management and mitigation of transportation risks on roads leading to the site; and management of community expectations during ongoing consultation and disclosure.This categorization evaluates actual project risks, where the project is defined as the scope of work funded by IFCs investment.  The scope of the project is limited and it has limited adverse environmental impacts that are generally site-specific, largely reversible, and readily addressed through mitigation measures.  In this context, the following summarizes the impacts associated with this early stage exploration project:This early stage exploration investment provides support for activities that are part of the exploration program, the completion of BFSs and the companys community engagement activities, and it does not involve mineral production or civil construction activities (although limited access roads and basic infrastructure, such as the camp site, is required at this stage).Potential environmental issues at the exploration stage are limited and associated with management of sampling and drilling sites, management of water resources, protection of soils, solid and liquid waste management, vehicle impacts, handling, use and storage of fuels and reclamation of exploration areas. Social issues include temporary access to communally held pastoral land (and potentially compensation for temporary loss of agricultural land), consultation with stakeholders while managing expectations, management of exploration camps and their workforce, and influx management. All of these impacts are limited, site-specific, almost completely reversible, and readily addressed through mitigation measures and careful management.  The draft disclosure and consultation process of the company is already in place and has been implemented diligently, letting the affected  communities know the scope and impacts of exploration work being undertaken and getting an early indication of community views and expectations.","","","","",28215,"",BC - Copper,"","","",""

In 2008 Frikom acquired Nova Sloga in Trstenik, central Serbia through a privatization deal, for its potential in fruit and vegetables packaging and its mineral water source.  Nova Sloga was established in 1953, changed its ownership structure in 1998 to a Public Enterprise (Srbijasume); and, in 2008 was privatized by Agrokor and is considered to be the most successful privatization in Serbia.

The Gold Ridge mine is an open pit gold mine on Guadalcanal Island (the largest of the Solomon Islands) which operated from August 1998 before closing due to civil unrest in June 2000. Following an international tender, the mine assets were purchased in December 2004 by ASG, a company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), which was established to acquire and redevelop the Gold Ridge mine. The Gold Ridge mine area consists of 4 adjacent deposits together with a crusher, mill and processing plant located 27 km by road from Honiara, the capital city of the Solomon Islands. The proposed investment program will rehabilitate and replace existing equipment and redevelop the mine area with a view to restarting production by 4thquarter 2010. At full production GRML is expected to produce an average of 124,000 oz. of gold annually. The projected mine life, based on current reserve estimates is just under 8 years, with potential to extend mine life to 12  15 years and beyond.","","","","","","The Gold Ridge Mine redevelopment is the largest private sector project in the Solomon Islands and is a strong fit with IFC investment strategy in the Pacific area and in support of financing of poorer (IDA eligible) countries. At full production the project can be expected to account for as much as 20% of Solomon Islands GDP, which relies today on external aid and rapidly dwindling revenues from logging. If successful, the project would also encourage investment in other mining developments and generally would enhance the reputation of  the Solomon Islands as an investment destination. The Project is expected to generate a range of positive development impacts including:Revenues for the Government of Solomon Islands and provincial government: The Solomon Islands government will receive an export tax of 1.5% of revenues for the life of mine, with an additional royalty of 0.3% to provincial government. GRML will pay corporate taxes of 30%, which are expected (depending on gold prices) to become payable in the fourth year of operations. GRML will also pay a 15% goods tax on consumables and fuel.Benefits to local communities: In addition to new housing and direct compensation to meet the Companys obligations to compensate households affected by the mine redevelopment, local landowners will receive, through a representative local landowner council, a royalty of 1.2% of revenues for the life of the mine. In addition the Company will implement community development initiatives under a Community Economic Development Plan. Job Creation In addition to employment during construction, the Project would create approximately 500 full time jobs. Additional employment will be generated in downstream service businesses (food services, various local contractor services, fuel supply, haulage, travel  and bank services). Development indicators to be monitored during the life of the IFC investment are:- direct employment levels- payments to Government in the form of royalties and taxes- annual Company expenditures on domestic goods and services- community development expenditures by the company.","","A part of the project's expected benefits are in the form of royalties, corporate and other tax payments to Government. In coming to a view of whether to support this project, IFC considered the value of the Projects benefits and the governance and other risks to these benefits. In doing so, IFC has reviewed a variety of governance assessments on Solomon Islands, including the 2008 World Bank Doing Business rankings which ranks  Solomon Islands 5th out of 47 low income countries. Solomon Islands compares favorably with peer countries, ranking 109th  of  180 on  Transparency Internationals Corruption Perceptions Index. A key consideration for IFCs proposed investment is the active engagement of regional partners through the Regional Assistance Mission for the Solomon Islands (RAMSI), which is working closely with the Solomon Islands Government: in stabilizing public finances, enabling the delivery of basic services to the community, payment of salaries to public servants and budget management.","","","IFCs review of this Brownfield investment has identified the following main environmental issues: strengthening of project EHS capacity to ensure full implementation of the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and development of more detailed mitigation procedures; erosion and sediment control related to open pit development in steep topography with high rainfall; protection of ground and surface water quality with respect to acid rock drainage, cyanide and metals loading; overall management of cyanide in accordance with the International Cyanide Management Code; emergency response procedures; proper management of the waste rock dump and tailings storage facility (TSF), including tailings and return water pipelines; control over biodiversity impacts such as vegetation clearing and timber sourcing (note that no protected areas or critical habitats have been identified); and comprehensive closure planning/costing. Several legacy issues will need to be dealt with, e.g. treatment and release of rainwater which has collected in the TSF since mining ceased, to ensure technical stability of that facility and repair of damaged sediment control dams. The main social issue associated with the project is the proposed relocation, to adjacent land areas, of some 1,350 persons residing on or near the Mine Lease area, in order to pave the way for restart  of open pit operations and haul road development. This will involve somewhat complex compensation and royalty arrangements which were exhaustively negotiated under the prior mine owners and which have subsequently been modified in consultation with affected parties.  Many of the people who will resettle had moved away as part of the original mine development but subsequently returned to the concession area during the unrest period around 2000. Most affected households are currently engaged in subsistence artisanal gold mining activities on Gold Ridge. Cessation of these activities will be accompanied by alternative livelihood programs and  for eligible households  payment of royalty monies. Stakeholder engagement is a key issue for this Project and is currently managed by a team of eight community liaison staff, including a manager, backed up by expatriate consultants.

IFCs Policy definition of a Category B project is a project where potential adverse social or environmental impacts are generally site-specific and limited, are largely reversible, and which can be readily addressed through mitigation measures.  Key issues identified during appraisal that defined the Categorization include:Project activities are not unusual, but are typical of small-scale oilfield exploration and production operations that can be readily managed and controlled by following good international industry practice.  Potential impacts can be eliminated, avoided or minimized by adhering to international standards, guidelines and design parameters. The existing export infrastructure in both countries can be used for the export of oil.  No significant new export facilities in Egypt (pipelines, terminals or tank farms etc) will be necessary for current and proposed future production. In Yemen, a pipeline for Block 49 is under consideration.The majority of KEC operations and planned activities in Egypt and Yemen are in remote desert area locations where IFCs environmental and social specialists have determined, on the basis of site visits and data collected, that significant environmental and social sensitivities are not present at existing facilities or are not anticipated in exploration areas where work has not begun.KEC has developed an integrated Health, Safety, Environment and Social Management System manual at the corporate level that is aligned with international standards and which will be implemented for all activities.The fields in an existing production area in Egypt (Area A) along the coast of the Gulf of Suez, and acquired by the Company in August 2008, have been poorly operated in the past.  Early improvements in management and operations have already been demonstrated since KEC took over operatorship.In relation to future exploration activities which will include seismic acquisition work and the drilling of individual wells, the Company will assess the exploration areas and proposed activities on a case by case basis in terms of potential environmental and social impacts.

Gryphon Minerals Inc,Investment,Environmental Documents,Completed,Africa,Burkina Faso,TERANGA GOLD (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2009-05-19T04:00:00Z,"",B,Other,"Gryphon is a mineral exploration company headquartered in Perth, with a listing on the Australian Stock Exchange since April 2004.  The companys flagship project is Banfora, an early stage exploration prospect in south western Burkina Faso. The project area contains five exploration licenses covering a total of 1,150 km2. The project is located in a gold belt zone across Mali and Burkina Faso that is host to some world class deposits including Tongon and Morila.  Gryphon commenced exploration at Banfora in late 2005, and since then has embarked on a detailed exploration program.  However, the majority of the project area remains unexplored.  The company has in the short time, drill-defined at least seven mineralized gold zones with a combined strike length in excess of five kilometers.  Significant gold mineralization has been intersected on all seven mineralized zones.  The company recently doubled its maiden resources at Banfora to 10.6 million tonnes with an average grade of 2.4 grams per tonne for 820,000 ounces of gold.  Banfora has the potential to host a large scale gold mineralization.  The company has deployed a highly experienced team of geologists with good experience in the region to conduct the exploration program.  Gryphon appears to be executing a well planned exploration program within the license areas reviewed. At the time of the appraisal three drilling rigs were in use operated by contractors (Boart Longyear and West African Drilling Services) practicing a mixture of compressed air RAB, Aircore and RC reverse circulation coring.Gryphon has a market capitalization of approximately $37 million (as of May 14, 2009).  Gryphon has a broad shareholder base and has attracted a reputable investor group to its share register, including Newmont Mining Corporation (NMC), Macquarie Bank, RMB Resources, Genesis Fund and Gryphons management team.  NMC has exploration tenements to the south and east of Banfora, and its investment in Gryphon presents an opportunity to consolidate any successful exploration programs in this prospective region.The proposed investment is to provide equity financing of up to A$2 million for Gryphon to further exploration work and complete feasibility studies at Banfora.  Gryphon also has other gold, nickel, uranium and diamond properties in Australia namely: Collurabbie, Mount Windarra, Mount Rankin, Radio, Duggan, Mulgabbie, Ellendale East and Mount Isa Uranium.  These properties are either not currently being actively explored by the company or have been optioned to other exploration companies to conduct the exploration work under joint venture frameworks.  IFCs financial support and future funding for Gryphon will only be utilised for continued exploration activities at the Banfora project.The license area lies in the southern sector of Burkina Faso and is largely tropical with an abundance of savanna with trees or shrubs and sparse forests.  This is traditionally a cotton growing area with medium-sized villages located in many parts of the license area.","","","","The review of this project consisted of appraising environmental, health, safety, and social information submitted by the company, and assessing the companys operations through a field visit conducted by the project team.  IFCs environmental and social review included a site visit in April 2008 to the Nogbele and Fourkoura Prospects on the Banfora Gold project (Banfora or the project) area in south-western Burkina Faso by an Environmental Specialist and a Technical Specialist.   IFC staff also conducted meetings with management and key technical, environmental and social staff from Gryphon Minerals Limited (Gryphon or the company).Interviews were also conducted with potentially affected communities in the Banfora district project area.  These communities included those who would likely be directly impacted should mining commence.","","","","","","","","","","","","This is a category B project according to IFCs procedure for Environmental and Social Review of projects, because it has limited adverse social and environmental impacts that are few in number, are site specific and will be largely reversible and readily addressed through mitigation measures.  The IFC made this categorization based on:   - Site visits to the Nogbele and Fourkoura Prospects on the Banfora Gold project area by Environmental and Technical specialists;- Meetings with management and key technical, environmental and social staff from Gryphon; and- Meetings with affected communities in the Banfora District.The key social and environmental issues in this project currently include:- Management of exploration activities  control of erosion and rehabilitation of drill roads, drill sites and trenches, safe disposal of oils, waste materials, dust control; water and effluent management; occupational health and safety; public safety; hazardous materials handling and management; emergency preparedness & response;- Infrastructure and associated facilities  public safety, dust controls, hazards management and mitigation of transportation risks;- Environmental, Health and Safety Management System and Policy commitments to ensure IFC Performance Standard compliance of any future mining and associated overburden and waste dumps - surface and groundwater protection; drainage; dust control; and- Community engagement, managing community expectations, influx management, artisanal mining, and community development planning.","","","","",27193,"",BE - Gold,"","","",""

The Gold Ridge Mine is an open pit gold mine on Guadalcanal Island, which is part of the Solomon Islands. GRML operated from August 1998 before closing due to civil unrest in Guadalcanal in June 2000. Following an international tender the mine assets were purchased in December 2004 by ASG, a company now listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), which was established to acquire and redevelop the Gold Ridge mine. The Gold Ridge Mine area consists of 4 adjacent deposits together with a crusher, mill and processing plant located approx. 40 km by road from Honiara, the capital city on Guadalcanal, the main island of the Solomon Islands. The proposed investment program will rehabilitate and replace existing equipment and redevelop the mine area with a view to restarting production by 4th quarter 2010. At full production GRML is expected to produce an average of 124,000 oz. of gold annually with a mine life, based on current reserve estimates, of just under 8 years, with potential to extend mine life to 12  15 years and beyond.    The Gold Ridge Mine redevelopment is the largest private sector project in the Solomon Islands and is a strong fit with IFC investment strategy in the Pacific area, with priorities of regional governments providing support to the Government of the Solomon Islands under the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, and to government of the Solomon Islands in promoting private sector investment and new sources of growth for the country.","","","","The review of this project consisted of appraising environmental, health, safety, and social documentation submitted by the company, and assessing the companys operations through a field visit conducted by the project team.

The Companys key focus is in the advancement of its early-stage exploration project, the Banfora Gold Project (Banfora or the Project), located in south-west Burkina Faso.  Over the last few years, Gryphon has conducted aggressive exploration at Banfora which has now yielded impressive discoveries.  The Company recently doubled its maiden resources at Banfora to 10.6 million tonnes with an average grade of 2.4 grams per tonne for 820,000 ounces of gold.  As a result, Gryphon is placing an increasing emphasis on the development of its Burkina Faso assets and this requires access to more capital.IFC has been invited to provide an equity investment of A$2 million to finance on-going exploration work at Banfora with the aim of proving up adequate resources that would lead to the development of a mine at Banfora. Funds raised will be applied to undertake further work targeting additional increases in resources at Gryphons flagship Banfora project, including:- Funding an in-fill drilling program within the existing defined resource zone;- Funding an ongoing reverse circulation/diamond drilling program following up on high grade extensions along strike at the Project;- Commencing reconnaissance rotary air blast/aircore/auger drilling testing high priority targets ; and- General working capital purposes.","","","","","","Fit with World Bank Group (WBG) Strategy:The proposed investment is consistent with the WBGs strategic priorities in Burkina Faso.The World Banks strategy for Burkina Faso emphasizes the need to pursue a vision based on regional economic integration, promoting foreign direct investment and export enhancement.  The extractive industries is specifically targeted as one of the sectors that should be developed to make optimal use of the countrys limited natural resource base to expand export earnings.  The strategy particularly identifies the mining sectors potential to offer a source of long-run, export-led growth.  The World Bank and IFCs country strategy focuses on promoting diversification of the economy and supporting project development in mining, with emphasis on junior miners. Development Impact:IFCs involvement in Burkina Fasos growing mining sector will have an important demonstration effect in terms of setting environmental and social standards. IFC will assist Gryphon to handle social, environmental, community development and mine closure issues in line with IFC Environmental and Social Performance Standards.The direct development impacts during the pure exploration and feasibility study stage are expected to be limited.  Because the investment predates any feasibility study, it is not yet possible to fully quantify or specify the potential development impacts during production stage. However, expected developmental impacts during production phase include:Demonstration Effect: Burkina Faso is an emerging resource-rich country which has attracted a lot of interest from the global mining community.  IFC involvement in the sector could assist in establishing some benchmarks on sustainable resource development.   Important demonstration effects include setting environmental and social standards.  IFC will assist Gryphon to handle social, environmental, community development and mine closure issues in line with IFC Environmental and Social Performance Standards.Economic Diversification and Community Development: The Project would support the Burkinabe governments efforts to diversify the economy from its current dependence on agricultural production. In addition, the project which is located outside the key centers of commercial activity would generate economic activity in what is otherwise an agrarian-based and under-developed part of the country.Revenues to Government: The Project, once operational, is expected to generate revenues in the form of taxes, dividends and royalties to the host Government and the Project would also generate positive foreign currency flows.Creation of Direct and Indirect Employment:The project could also have a high impact on local economies through the generation of employment opportunities for the local population.  The key development indicators that are to be monitored during the life of IFCs investments are:  (i) number of projects that would employ industry best practices on sustainable resource development; (ii) number of non-farm economic activities including community development projects that would develop around the project; (iii) the direct and indirect increase in non-farm jobs that would be created around the project; and (iv) amount of taxes, dividends and royalties paid to government as a result of the project.","","An important benefit of the project is revenue flows to the government in the form of taxes, dividends and royalties.  World Bank Mining Policy Division is engaged with the Government of Burkina Faso with respect to mining sector policy reforms and capacity building, and Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) implementation.  The Government has shown a strong commitment to developing an internationally competitive mining sector enhanced by good governance and transparency.Burkina Faso is generally seen, based on available indicators such as Transparency Internationals Corruption Perception Index and the World Bank Institutes Governance Indicators, as taking the necessary steps to increase its governance and transparency capacity. The Companys is supportive of the efforts to implement good governance and transparency in the sector and has committed to making public disclosure of all revenue payments to the government once commercial production begins.  On balance, given the governance context, the current engagement of the World Bank, and the expected development impacts, IFC believes this is a project which it should support.","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because the  limited number of specific potential environmental and social impacts can be either avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards and guidelines.

Kuwait Energy Company KSCC,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Middle East and North Africa,MENA Region,KUWAIT ENERGY COMPANY KSCC,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2009-05-19T04:00:00Z,2009-06-19T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"Kuwait Energy Company KSCC (KEC or the Company), is one of the very few local privately-owned oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) companies in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).  IFC is proposing to provide financing to KEC to: - finance the development of its producing and development assets in Egypt and Yemen; and - accelerate exploration in Egypt and Yemen (the Project).  In 2009, KECs work program in Egypt and Yemen includes conducting seismic and drilling 24 wells.","","","","","","The project will lead to further exploration, appraisal and development of domestic natural resources in Egypt and Yemen. Both countries have seen significant declines in their oil production in recent times, coupled with a fast increase in domestic demand.  Both governments are highly dependent on oil and gas revenues to maintain macro-economic stability as well as their social welfare programs.In Egypt, oil production has declined from a peak of nearly 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 1997 to around 710,000 bpd in 2007. Given the rapid increase in domestic oil demand, Egypt is expected to become a net oil importer soon.  Oil and gas revenues account for 15% of Egypts Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 46% of Egypts exports. The sector is also the most important source of fiscal revenues for the Government of Egypt (GOE), representing 25% of GOEs budgeted revenues for 2008/9. In Yemen, the poorest country in the MENA region, oil production is declining at an even more rapid rate, with 2008 output averaging just 293,000 bpd, compared to a peak of 457,000 bpd in 2001.  Production decline is expected to accelerate over the next few years if no significant new discoveries are made, with current forecasts predicting Yemen will run out of oil in the next 10 to 12 years. Yemens oil and gas sector accounts for over 90% of the countrys export earnings and an estimated 75% of Government of Yemens (GOY) revenue. The Project is expected to produce significant development impacts:  - Contribution to Government Revenues: The Project benefits to Egypt and Yemen include revenues that accrue to these governments in the form of production share, royalties and corporate taxes.  In 2008, GOEs fiscal take from KECs operations in Egypt was US$58 million and GOYs take was US$19 million. As stated above, both governments are highly dependent on continuing fiscal revenues from the oil and gas sector in order to sustain their respective social programs. The net present value of the total payments to the GOE from 2009 to 2012 is expected to be over US$100 million. Given the exploratory nature of KECs assets in Yemen, future revenues to GOY will depend on the success of the Companys exploration activities in 2009. - Employment and development of local skills: The Project will help sustain employment in both countries. In Egypt, the operating company currently employs approximately 50 full time employees and has 175 contractors. This is expected to rise to nearly 70 personnel and approximately 350 contractors by 2010, of which at least 90% will be Egyptian nationals.  Without this Project and the associated development and exploration programs, these jobs would be largely lost.  In Yemen, due to the early stage of operations, KEC currently has less than 10 people directly employed and approximately 125 contractors. With the start of significant exploration activity this figure is expected to rise to approximately 15 direct employees and an average of 175 contracted staff by 2010. Approximately 70% of direct personnel in Yemen are expected to be Yemeni nationals. - Supporting the development of local independent E&P sector in MENA: Through this financing, IFC will play an important role in supporting the only sizeable private Kuwaiti E&P player and the only major Kuwaiti company run by a woman. The E&P sector in MENA has traditionally been dominated by large state-owned oil companies or Western oil and gas companies. KEC is one of the first significant attempts by the local private sector to participate in this sector. KECs ability to grow into a company on a par with other mid-size international E&P companies is hoped to encourage other such private sector initiatives.The key development indicators to be monitored during the life of the IFC investment include:(1) Payments accruing to governments;(2) Direct employment levels;(3) Local purchase of goods and services (including contractors); and(4) KEC 2P net reserves.","","IFC has considered the value of the Project's main benefits (in the form of taxes, royalties, production share and other payments) and has assessed potential governance and other risks to these benefits and has come to the view that the Project should be supported.  In coming to this view, IFC has examined various governance and corruption indices for both Egypt and Yemen, including the World Bank Institute's (WBI) Governance Indicators as well as Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index. Moreover, the World Bank Group (WBG) is actively involved in supporting the governments to address issues of governance and corruption. The Company has also agreed to disclose publicly all its payments to both the governments of Egypt and Yemen.- Egypt: Governance, Revenue Management and TransparencyIn the case of Egypt, the GOEs share of hydrocarbon revenues partly accrues to the Ministry of Petroleum through the Egyptian General Petroleum Company (EGPC) and for income taxes to the Ministry of Finance (MOF).  GOEs revenues are mostly reinvested or directly applied to finance domestic subsidies for energy products for the countrys population.  According to the WBI Indicators, Egypt ranks in the 39th percentile in terms of Government Effectiveness, 43rd percentile in Regulatory Quality, and 36th percentile in Control of Corruption. In Transparency Internationals 2008 Corruption Perceptions Index, Egypt ranked 115th overall out of 180 countries measured by this index. At the request of the GOE, the WBG has been actively engaged in Egypt on transparency and anti-corruption issues since early 2008 and a specific technical assistance package is currently being discussed. WBG is also active in other areas of assistance to GOE in the energy sector including on energy pricing policy (ESMAP- EG Energy Pricing Strategy - P107068) and natural gas distribution (EGYPT Natural Gas Connections Project - P095392). While Egypt is not an Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) candidate, the WBG has already tried to engage the GOE on this front. All new oil and gas concessions in Egypt follow a model agreement whose main terms are public.- Yemen: Governance, Revenue Management and TransparencyIn the case of Yemen the benefits, mainly in the form of taxes, royalties and other remittances accrue mainly to the Ministry of Oil & Minerals (MOM).  According to the WBI Indicators, Yemen ranks in the 13th percentile in terms of Government Effectiveness, 24th percentile in Regulatory Quality and 33rd percentile in Control of Corruption. In Transparency Internationals 2008 Corruption Perceptions Index, Yemen was positioned 141st out of 180 countries measured. The GOY is engaged in an active reform process and the WBG, which has a long standing relationship with GOY, has been supporting the GOY in recent measures to improve governance and fight corruption, including: joining the EITI process - Yemen has been an EITI candidate country since 2007, effectively establishing the Supreme National Anti-Corruption Committee (SNACC), adopting a new procurement law based on international good practices, and starting to improve public finance management. In Yemen, the main terms of licenses for oil and gas exploration blocks, for which there are regular international bidding rounds, are also public.","","","The Project is rated Category B under IFCs Policy on Social and Environmental Sustainability.

In particular, IZGAZ activities have already contributed greatly to the use of natural gas as a fuel for residential cooking and heating. This has greatly reduced the reliance on lignite, coal, fuelwood and LPG by households, and has led to benefits of convenience and lower household fuel bills, as well as resulting in lower local atmospheric pollution.

(Esoko or the company) began as TradeNet in 2004 as a software application undertaken by a Ghanaian software incubator BusyLab. Esokos product is a market information platform - an SMS and web-based platform that enables real time data gathering and dissemination to end-users (any internet or mobile phone user).  The platform can be applied to any application or industry that would benefit from direct access to a mobile phone based-population, specifically one that requires low-cost usage.  Esoko has developed a strategy to expand its operation in Africa and Asia through franchising.  Esoko operates its own franchise in Ghana (Esoko Ghana  100% owned) in order to showcase the product and provide feedback for product development.  Esoko Networks has licensed its platform in 8 African countries and Afghanistan.  Most licensees are public projects, government initiatives or NGOs seeking to establish commercial market information systems.The first and most developed application on the platform is Esoko Market Live, a market information system for the agri-business sector.   This product provides agriculture commodity prices (input and output) and trading capability to rural farmers, buyers, traders, associations and agri-businesses mostly via SMS.  Customer feedback indicates a reduction in market inefficiencies through improvement in supply chains, more equitable pricing and better access to markets for farmers and buyers.","","","","","","Market information systems have a high development impact in industries where they are implemented as dissemination of pricing information empowers producers, particularly in low income economies.  Markets in Ghana and elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa are inefficient. These markets are characterized by the following constraints: long transaction cycles between producers and consumers; poor access to appropriate and timely market information; low product volumes of varied quality offered by small scale and individual producers; and poorly structured and inefficient markets. The lack of market information represents a significant impediment to market access especially for small producers: it substantially increases transaction costs and reduces market efficiency.  The marketing chain consists of multiple middlemen, each taking a margin at every stage of the chain, and price variations in space and time are often large and erratic.In case of Esoko Market Live, Esoko is helping farmers to increase their incomes by giving them better access to markets and by empowering them to negotiate better transaction terms.

However considerable risk capacity for supporting such financing is available with the export credit agencies.  Many potential borrowers, especially smaller and medium sized enterprises, in the smaller emerging markets are unable to access ECA supported finance as they are not familiar with the technical and commercial aspects of this type of financing and do not have strong relationships with the institutions involved in ECA supported financing.  In this context, there is a need for platform that can provide advisory assistance to facilitate transactions between potential borrowers seeking medium to longer term finance with institutions involved in ECA supported finance.Project Description:  GEFL will be a specialized advisory intermediary and partnership that will serve as  an advisory and syndication vehicle for medium- / long-term ECA-backed trade finance transactions. It will provide a means to leverage the origination and funding and risk acceptance capacity of OECD and emerging market banks with risk capacity of  ECAs to create win-win solutions for all parties.  The business rationale for GEFL arises from the potential synergy that can be created by combining the comparative strengths of local banks in emerging markets and OECD banks in origination, structuring and financing ECA supported transactions. Regionally focused OECD banks in developed markets have strong domestic networks and close ties with their domestic exporter base. They are very familiar with the procedures and practices of their home ECAs. However they often lack adequate access to importer customers, and close relationships with local banks in a large number of emerging markets.  They are less willing to take importer risks in emerging markets. Most domestic banks in emerging markets are not familiar with ECA procedures and are not eligible for ECA cover in several markets. Some ECAs have made efforts to directly engage with local banks but these have met with limited success for various reasons including a lack of familiarity with ECA procedures and lack of direct access to a large number of ECAs necessary to develop a viable ECA backed financing program.It is proposed that the GEFL project will be implemented in two stages. In the Pilot Stage, GEFL will be established as a pilot program that will engage in the extensive education and marketing process with all stakeholders, develop origination and servicing agreements, and develop a more detailed business strategy (incl. a detailed business plan for the Final Stage). It would provide advice and technical assistance to emerging market banks that would be interested in participating in its programs. GEFL would undertake a few pilot advisory  transactions on an advisory basis in this phase to validate the business model and earn adequate revenue (advisory income) to break even. If the Pilot Stage is successful, GEFL would transfer into and continue its activities in the Final Stage and further develop and expand its advisory  activities to create a worldwide business. GEFL will function as an open platform, and it is expected that the circle of shareholders will increase over time. The initial shareholders of , GEFL will be KfW-IPEX, Unicredit Group, Northstar Trade Finance Inc. (a Canadian SME trade finance company) and IFC. A team of experienced bankers would be hired to get GEFL started.","","","","","","Trade finance is the lifeline of global trade, and it is widely recognized that ECAs are one of the main pillars of the global trade pattern, in particular for the medium- / long-term finance of large capital goods investments.  The Project would help leverage  ECA capacity  to overcome constraints on medium to long term trade finance currently imposed by the crisis.  Through its intermediation GEFL will help in structuring transactions and bringing the parties together.  In the process GEFL will facilitate greater access to medium and long term trade finance especially for smaller and medium sized companies in the smaller emerging markets where such access is particularly inadequate.","","","","",The Project is mainly engaged in education and marketing activities and has been classified as a Category C project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.  GEFL is required to refrain from providing advisory and restructuring services to export activities or banks that are substantially involved in areas on IFCs FI Exclusion List or have unresolved E&S issues.  GEFL is also suggested to include proper environmental and social requirements when developing its business plan for the second stage.

TJH is owned by Bouygues Travaux Publics ('Bouygues') from France and Autoroutes du Sud de la France (""ASF"") (the 'Sponsors').  An affiliated company to TJH, Jamaican Infrastructure Operator Ltd. ('JIO') is the operator of the concession, and Bouygues' construction arm, Bouygues Travaux Publics ('BYTP'), is the prime contractor.

Phase 1A from Kingston to Sandy Bay has been completed and is already operational.  Construction of Phase 1B has been subdivided into to two sections  Phase 1B-1 from Sandy Bay to Four Paths and Phase 1B-2 which will extend the toll road to Williamsfield (near Mandeville).  The financing contemplated by IFC is for the expansion of the existing toll motorway west of Sandy Bay by an additional 17 km further west up to the town of Four Paths (Phase 1B-1) (2x2 lanes carriageway).

Phase 1B-1 will begin at road km 33 at Sandy Bay, and pass through rolling terrain to the south of the right-of-way of the Jamaica Railway Corporation rail line.  In this area the railway line forms the northern boundary of the Portland Bight Protected Area (PBPA) and the proposed highway traverses a small section of the PBPA.  An interchange will be constructed at km 41 to provide access to the community of May Pen.  The alignment then crosses the Rio Minho at km 44, parallel to and just south of where the existing A2 Road crosses the river.  The river crossing was selected to minimize the bridge length for the river crossing, but as a result will require the partial relocation of two existing sand and gravel quarries.

West of the Rio Minho the alignment will be constructed approximately two meters above existing ground for drainage purposes, passing through sugarcane fields, crossing several gullies, local roads, field connectors and an existing railway spur line.  At km 50, the alignment connects with the existing A2 Road near Four Paths (end of the Phase 1B-1 section), shortly after a Toll Plaza.  Sanitary facilities will be provided at the toll plaza.  The road will be fenced along its length.  Crossings (overpasses and underpasses) will be provided for main/local roads and to maintain access to properties.  The local road network will remain available for persons who do not wish to use a toll highway.  Construction is expected to take 24 months.  Traffic enforcement will be provided by the Government of Jamaica, while breakdown services will be provided by the toll road operator.","","","","Highway 2000 is the centerpiece of the multi-year Millennium Projects Programme initiated by the Government of Jamaica, and will connect the capital Kingston with the major north coast centers of Montego Bay and Ocho Rios.  Highway 2000 is envisioned to serve as a catalyst for economic activities along the corridor and improve ground transportation within Jamaica. Phase 1 of Highway 2000 is being developed on a design, build, operate and transfer ('BOT') basis by TransJamaican Highway Limited (""TJH' or the ""Company"").  The highway will be a four to six lane controlled-access, tolled motorway with fully grade separated interchanges and intersections built according to modern international standards.  Phase 1A (section from Kingston to Sandy Bay and Portmore Causeway) was completed in phases between September 2003 and July 2006.

The Project is the extension (Phase 1B-1) from the current highway terminus at Sandy Bay, west to Four Paths, and the refinancing of an existing medium-term facility that was put in place for the financing of Phase 1A.  The financing package is currently expected to be by a consortium of IFC, Inter-American Development Bank ('IDB'), Proparco, and European Investment Bank ('EIB'), with whom IFC coordinated its appraisal.  IFC's review consisted of appraising environmental, health and safety, human resources and social information provided by the company and through first-hand observation and data collection through meetings at the offices of TJH and the Jamaican implementing agency, National Road Operating & Construction Company Ltd. ('NROCC').  IFC also met with the Kingston-based EIA consultant, Environmental Solutions Ltd., regarding key issues/analyses and public consultation.  Two site visits were conducted of the existing initial Phase 1A as well as the proposed new right-of-way for Phase 1B and portions of Phase 2 of Highway 2000 that are being constructed independently of the concession.  IFC's review included an assessment of labor relations, as well as interviews with senior management and human resources personnel of the highway operator, Jamaican Infrastructure Operator Ltd.  Furthermore, IFC interviewed the fishermen affected by Phase 1A and other residents and business that will need to be affected or relocated in the context of Phase 1B-1 of this project and reviewed the resettlement and land acquisition framework and the public consultation undertaken by NROCC for this purpose.

PAE is the second largest oil and gas producer in Argentina and has blocks located in the four major hydrocarbon basins  Golfo San Jorge, Austral, Neuquina and Northwest. The most significant block in terms of both reserves and production is the Cerro Dragon block in the Golfo San Jorge basin, located in the south of Argentina. IFC has been requested by PAE to mobilize a corporate loan facility of up to $250 million, including up to $50 million for its own account. The loan proceeds will partially fund the Companys 2009 capital expenditures for further development of PAEs most prolific oil assets, Cerro Dragon, Piedra Clavada and Koluel Kaike in the Golfo San Jorge Basin (GSJ) (the Project). The Project will include activities covering drilling and facility expansions and improvements and part of the 2009 investment program will go towards increasing gas production.  By the end of 2009, the planned activities are expected to increase oil and gas production.","","","","","","Alleviation of domestic oil and gas shortage:  Gas demand growth has outpaced gas supply in Argentina in recent years.  The growing gap has been driven by under-investment in the sector on the one hand and sustained economic expansion on the other.  The latter was fuelled by a combination of growth in the industrial sectors, increased use of natural gas in vehicles and further distorted by energy pricing policies.  In this context PAE is one of the few operators in the country continuing to increase its oil and gas production.  Gas represents around 38% of the Companys proven reserves and part of the 2009 investment program will go towards increasing gas production.  In the past 7 years PAE has grown its oil production by 39% while nationwide production (including PAE) has declined by 20%. In the same period, PAE grew its gas production by 84% compared to a 28% increase in nationwide production.  The impact of the Companys investment program in the GSJ region is expected to result in an average annual increase of production of approximately 2.7% p.a. or 14% total over the next four years.  Creation/Preservation of local employment:  PAE is a key employer in the regions where it operates, especially in the GSJ basin where it employs 914 direct staff and almost 6730 contractors. The IFC investment will contribute to the Companys growth, which has lead to an average of 200 new direct jobs created per annum since 2005. In addition, the investment will help maintain the employment level on a company-wide basis in the provinces of Chubut and Santa Cruz, where the oil and gas industry offers significant employment opportunities.  Strong community development and linkages program:  PAE continues to spend increasing amounts on social development programs ranging from education and health programs to Small Medium Enterprise support programs in its areas of operation.  In 2007 and 2008, the Company spent $3.6 million and $5.5 million, respectively, on these programs. Local/National Sourcing:  The Company procures most of its goods and services in Argentina.  In 2008, PAE spent approximately $896 million on Argentine investments, goods and services from national and regional suppliers, and a large portion of the 2009 capital expenditure is expected to be sourced locally/nationally.Contribution to government revenues:  PAE contributes significant fiscal revenues to all levels of government. During 2008, PAE made approximately US$1.3 billion in payments to various levels of government consisting of income taxes, royalties, export tariff and other taxes. The Company submits financial statements on quarterly basis to the Argentinas National Securities Commission as part of its obligation, and such disclosures are available publicly. In addition to remaining a significant contributor of tax revenues for both the federal and regional budgets and is also expected to continue contributing to Argentinas foreign currency earning over the life of the IFC loans. Indicators to monitor development impact include (i) gas production, (ii) payments to government, (iii) employment maintained/created, (iv) local/national purchasing; and (iv) community development programs.","","The Project is expected to generate a number of benefits: jobs, business for local suppliers, increase in supply in oil and gas, and revenues to governments. Tax paid to the government will remain sizable, with a significant portion paid to provincial governments. Most of the development impacts are the result of the Companys direct action (i.e. contacts with local suppliers, employment, and community development). As a result, IFC expects the governance risk to these benefits to be low.","","","IFCs early review of this investment has identified the following potential environmental, social, health, and safety issues: regional footprint, air emissions, venting and flaring, greenhouse gases, solid waste management, drilling muds and cutting, completion and workover fluids, pollution control, use of natural resources,  spills, occupational health and safety, contractors'' EHS performance, land transportation safety, emergency preparedness and response,  community engagement and land acquisition, cultural and archaeological findings preservation.

The current project activities include pre-feasibility study stage exploration drilling, environmental and social studies, and technical and economic assessments.","","","","","","The Project is located in a remote region in the rural area of the Andes highlands with very limited employment opportunities other than sheep grazing.  During the exploration phase, in addition to generating direct employment, the Company is implementing a program to improve local livelihoods through training and provision of materials for fish farming, greenhouse cultivation of vegetables, farming of fodder, sowing and occupational training.  
The Project is expected to have limited development impacts during exploration phase, but potentially significant economic development impacts during construction and production phases, including tax revenues/foreign exchange contribution to the national economy, contribution to the local government budgets, as well as potential development of transportation and energy infrastructure that will improve possibilities for other economic activities.","","A part of the benefit of the potential future mine development would come in the form of taxes and royalties that would be paid to government (part of which will be distributed at the local level).  The IFC has considered the risks to these benefits and, given its assessment of the Government capacity to effectively use these revenues (including the potential for engagement in programs at the municipal level), believes that on balance this is a project it should support.  

Peru is a member of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative ('EITI') and has begun the implementation process.  Peru already discloses tax and royalty payments paid to Government from the oil, natural gas and mining sectors.  Antares has agreed to specifically disclose all its payments (royalties, taxes) paid to Government, both at central and regional/local levels.  Mining concessions are publicly available for review, further enhancing the transparency of the mining sector in Peru.","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.  The potential environmental impacts associated with this investment, which covers the completion of the exploration phase and feasibility study activities, are related to management of sampling and drilling sites, erosion and rehabilitation of temporary roads, management of water resources, waste management; water management; public safety, dust control, hazardous materials management and mitigation of transportation risks on roads leading to the site. Social issues include temporary land access (and compensation for temporary loss of agricultural land), consultation with stakeholders while managing expectations, management of the exploration camp and its workforce and influx management.  All of these impacts are limited, site-specific, almost completely reversible and readily addressed through mitigation measures and careful management.   For this exploration phase, Antares is working with IFC to formalize its existing draft Policies into a full Health, Safety, Environment & Community (HSEC) Policy. In addition, Antares commissioned a Phase I baseline assessment which included air and water quality, bio-diveristy, archaeology and noise. There has been significant consultation with the key communities, and it is apparent that a future mining project would enjoy broad support.  Full assessment of impacts, consultation and disclosure will take place prior to any potential mine development through a full Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA).  The Haquira Project concessions encompass 18 Rural Andean Communities (RACs) of which three are directly impacted at the current stage of operations. Communal land ownership and community use of natural resources (e.g. pasture lands), and traditional decision-making arrangements are common in RACs.  The RACs within the concession are poor, vulnerable, and dependent on subsistence small-scale farming, herding, and grazing and some limited wage labor related to the exploration activities.  They have limited access to social services, roads, and markets. Antares will continue to work closely with these communities undertaking consultation to ensure that Broad Support is maintained. Antares will also work within the provisions of Performance Standard 7 as appropriate and in accordance with the wishes of the communities.For a junior exploration company at this stage of development, Antares has developed an impressive community program which includes 17 small capacity building projects. No resettlement is being undertaken for this project, and although small areas of pastoral land are temporarily set aside for exploration, this temporary economic displacement does not result in any significant adverse impacts in terms of the communities livelihoods.

This expansion project will continue to drive competition in a relatively low penetration market and provide cellular telephone services to areas that currently have no mobile, fixed or internet services.","","","","","","The project will offer a wide range of standard and value added mobile services; given the penetration level of existing telecommunications infrastructure in the country, the project will have a significant development impact for both individuals and businesses.  With fixed line penetration of slightly more than 1% and mobile penetration of 18%, Papua New Guinea still ranks with the countries in the low end of the tele-density scale worldwide.   

The project will improve the access to reliable and affordable telecommunication services for consumers and businesses.  The company projects that mobile penetration will continue to grow to 25% by 2012.  

The project will also continue to support the telecom liberalization process of the Government of PNG.  PNG began the process of liberalizing the telecommunication sector through the Telecoms Act of 1996 and the ICCC (Regulatory) Act of 2002.  In April 2007, the ICCC granted two mobile licenses, one to Digicel and the other to Dawamiba, an Indonesian group.  In February 2008, the National Executive Council ('NEC') approved the National ICT Policy 2008 ('ICT Policy') as PNG Government Policy.  The 2008 ICT Policy, primarily drafted to increase competition in the telecommunication industry, set out a two-phased approach with phase-1 as a transition period for a gradual introduction of open competition and phase-2 as an implementation period for prescribed, approved telecom sector reforms.

The Cleaner Production Lending Facility (CPLF, the Facility) is a proposed three year, US$125 million loan facility to finance Cleaner Production (CP) investments globally among IFC portfolio clients in good standing.  The Facility will build upon and scale up the Cleaner Production Lending Pilot (CPLP), a US$20 million facility approved by IFC's Board in 2007 to promote CP investments among IFC portfolio clients. The scale up is made necessary by the successful utilization of all funding made available under the pilot and strong demand from IFC's clients for continued support in identifying and financing CP projects. 

Like the pilot, CPLF will support investments in energy efficiency, use of renewable energy, recycling, water saving and use of clean tech solutions for IFC clients across a range of sectors and regions. Client demand for the integrated CP loan and advisory services offering developed under CPLP is due to the cost-saving and typical short payback characteristics of CP projects and the opportunity they give clients to improve their competitiveness and 'green' their image. The CPLF will finance these high impact CP projects through a streamlined CP loan process established under the pilot.  A complementary advisory services project will support CP audits for clients (co-funded using donor funds) who require technical support to identify CP projects. 
 
CP is the improvement of operational processes to make more efficient use of inputs such as raw materials, energy and water along a company's value chain. Effective CP interventions: i) reduce resource consumption at the source and hence waste and environmental impact, thus reducing or eliminating the need for costly end-of-pipe solutions; and ii) improve operating efficiencies and reduce operating costs. Many CP projects also reduce CO2 emissions, thus helping to mitigate climate change.","","","","","","
The CPLF will focus resources and awareness on financially viable improvements in environmental performance across a range of sectors in IFC client countries. CP projects supported through the Facility are expected to be economically attractive as resource savings outweigh implementation costs. Key expected development impacts includes: i) having a positive climate change mitigation impact, including a reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; ii) enhancing the sustainable competitiveness of IFC's private sector clients; iii) supporting technology transfer; and iv) having a demonstration effect. Specific expected environmental benefits and climate change impacts (as relevant for the CP project) will be monitored.","","","","","All CPLF projects will be required to have overall positive environmental impacts, and most projects supported will have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts and therefore individually would be considered Category C projects.  However, in rare cases, new though limited potentially adverse, E&S impacts might be introduced by a CPLF project.  Such CPLF interventions would be Category B projects, hence the facility under which such projects may be processed is also considered a Category B project.","
Potential recipients of CP Loans under the proposed Facility will be existing IFC clients in good standing with IFC and in material compliance with existing IFC covenants, in line with established eligibility criteria.  The specific companies to be supported through CPLF will be identified once Board approval for the overall facility has been received.  A separate SPI will be prepared and released in respect of each proposed CP Loan made through the CPLF before loan approval and commitment.","

(the 'Company' or 'CG Togo') is the local subsidiary of ContourGlobal which develops and operates electric power and district heating businesses around the world. CG Togo has entered into a 25-year concession and power purchase agreement to develop, construct and operate a 100 MW thermal power plant on a brown-field site in Lomé, Togo (the 'Project'). The Project will be the first substantial foreign investment in Togo in over a decade and will be one of the most significant investments in the West African power sector in over twenty years. CG Togo will be capable of producing up to ~780 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity per annum which it will sell to the Togolese electric distribution company, Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo (CEET).  Construction began in May 2009 and is expected to be completed and operational in April 2010.  

The plant will be powered by six Wärtsilä 18V50DF engines (16.6 MW each), with tri-fuel burning capability to operate on natural gas (NG), heavy fuel oil (HFO), and distillate diesel oil (DDO). HFO will be the primary source of fuel until NG becomes available via the West African Gas Pipeline.  

In December 2008, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) signed a US$146 million nonrecourse loan agreement with CG Togo. Financial closing was reached in May 2009. IFC is considering a 20% equity stake in the project.","","","","","","
In addition to representing one of the largest sources of Foreign Direct Investment ('FDI') to Togo in recent years, the project will help improve the sustainability of Togo's power sector by: 
Providing energy security through reliable power supply.  Acute power shortages meant that in recent years Togo has had to institute a power rationing program with daily electricity cuts of up to 4-6 hours. Major industrial customers have had substantial cutbacks in operations due to inadequate and unreliable power supply and are having to develop expensive off-grid power supply arrangements.
Diversifying power source: By adding thermal power to Togo's and the region's hydro-dominated electricity sector (mostly imported from Ghana), the project will improve the long-term security of energy supply within the region.
Leveraging private sector to support country's infrastructure needs: After more than a decade of isolation from the development community and with little private investment, Togo's essential infrastructure is in a very poor state.  With large infrastructure financing needs, Togo will need to leverage private sources where possible. 
Improved Health & Safety.  Load shedding reduces road safety (particularly at night) and interrupts the proper functioning of medical centers.  The project will help avert power shortages. 
Contributing to fiscal revenues: The project will generate concession revenues for the Government of Togo.
Reducing Togo's carbon emissions:  The project will help displace diesel generated electricity with HFO and eventually with natural gas.","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.  The company has conducted extensive environmental and social assessment and prepared action plans to effectively manage potential environmental and social risks of the project.  The key E&S issues identified at appraisal included air emissions and ambient air quality impacts, cumulative environmental impact assessment, remediation of the contaminated project site, greenhouse gas emissions, occupational health and safety management, waste management, emergency preparedness and response, community health and safety, economic displacement of small number of farmers and vendors, and community engagement.","

CTL is located in the industrial zone of Lomé. The project consists of six 18V50DF Wärtsilä engines in a power house with associated auxiliaries and buildings.  In October 2006, ContourGlobal Togo SA signed a concession agreement with the government of Togo about rehabilitation, extension and exploitation of the CTL, and in May 2007, the company signed a 25-year power purchase agreement to sell all of the projects generation to Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo (CEET - the national distribution company).  The project is an extension of CTL and rehabilitation of the existing CTL is not considered part of the project.  The project is planned to be fueled by natural gas once this becomes available through the West Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP).  WAGP is a 678 km offshore and partly onshore regional gas pipeline designed to supply gas from Nigeria to Ghana, Benin and Togo, and is being developed with support by the World Bank and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency which approved the project on November 23 2004.  The connection from the WAGP gas pipeline to the CTL, including the Regulating and Metering Station, is being constructed by the WAGP developer, and is expected to be completed in late 2009 or early 2010.  However, to mitigate the uncertainty in the availability of gas, the project is designed to be able to use not only natural gas, but also Heavy Fuel Oil and Diesel Fuel Oil (tri-fuel design). It is expected that the project will temporarily run on HFO in its initial years of operation given the disruptions of supply of gas in Nigeria. HFO will be delivered from the existing oil pipelines connected to CTL from the neighboring Societe Togolaise de Stockage de Lomé (STSL) storage facility. Wärtsilä Finland OY, the engineering, procurement, construction (EPC) contractor, has started the construction in May 2009 with a targeted start of commercial operation in April 2010.    Electricity by the project will be delivered using the existing 161kV transmission lines owned and operated by CEB and CEETs 20kV transmission line.  The CTL site is contaminated by hydrocarbons and other hazardous wastes due to past operation of CTL.  Although CGT is not the responsible party for the origin of the contamination, the company is implementing remediation of the contaminated soil as part of the project.

('Shuoren,' or the 'Company') designs and implements blast furnace dehumidification technology for major steel manufacturers in China.  Shuoren's proprietary technology is designed to improve energy efficiency, both from reduced energy costs and from improved performance.  Shuoren is part of an emerging group of energy management companies ('EMC', or 'ESCO') that finance, install, operate and maintain equipment that support energy efficiencies.","","","","","","Energy efficiency improvements are important for both climate change and sustainable growth.  Both in China and other countries, better management of natural resources and decreased pollution will be necessary to alleviate the strains of continued economic and population growth.

Energy management companies are emerging as rapidly increasing critical supporters of energy efficiency technology, particularly in China.  Since 1996, when the World Bank-supported China's Energy Conservation Project, which helped found three pilot EMCs, over 100 EMC companies have emerged. As large industrial companies typically do not have the in-house technological, managerial or financial capacity devoted for the development of energy efficiency technologies, the services provided by EMC companies are recognized as a unique value proposition and viable standalone businesses.  However, EMCs face a host of challenges themselves, and in particular have difficulty obtaining financing due to lack of familiarity with their business model.

An investment in Shuoren will greatly support the Company's ability to develop and grow in the domestic energy efficiency sector, primarily focusing on steel but also expanding to other sectors.  Efforts to reduce the energy consumption driven by China's growth, especially with growing environmental pressures and the global financial crisis are continuing and increasingly being stressed by the national government and international community.

The Project will have significant developmental impact by:

Contributing to the development of the clean technology sector in China;

Enabling turnkey solutions for clients who benefit from the introduction of energy efficiency technology to decrease upfront capital costs required to implement projects that reduce energy use and mitigate environmental impacts; and

Assisting the government of China in achieving its energy reduction goals in the short and long term, which is an important part of global initiatives to mitigate climate change impacts.","","","","","Environmental benefits result from Shuoren''s activities through reductions in energy usage and carbon emissions, as well as from the partnership between Shuoren and the World Resources Institute for carbon tracking across various industries in China.Where Shuoren conducts operations and has control over outsourced manufacturing, it will be required to manage all relevant environmental, health and safety risks according to IFC Performance Standards for the duration of IFC''s investment.

To resolve these problems, the City launched a staged long-term sewerage program, implemented by its 100%-owned municipal company Ufa Vodokanal (UVK or the Company).  This rehabilitation program has been supported in part by an IBRD loan of $20.8 million disbursed over 2006/2007 and by an EBRD loan of RUB500 million (approximately $15-16 million) signed in 2007.

The target size of the Fund is $100 million.  The Fund intends to focus on companies offering life insurance primarily but will also consider investing in companies providing health and property insurance and long-term contractual savings products. LeapFrog FIF will be the first micro-insurance investment vehicle globally and intends to develop three broad categories of investments: (i) investments in existing micro-insurance businesses; (ii) distribution-driven investments by partnering with MFIs or NGOs that have a large footprint; and (iii) insurer-driven investments by partnering with insurance companies that will look to LeapFrog FIF to share the early risk of their investments in microinsurance businesses.,"","","","","","The Fund would serve as a catalyst for the development of the microinsurance industry throughout the target regions and would introduce insurance, savings and/or protection products that would otherwise not be available to the poor. In addition, the Fund will facilitate knowledge management and transfer which is crucial for the development of a healthy and dynamic primary microinsurance market and is necessary for a holistic micro risk protection/lending solution. Finally, it would stimulate additional demand by catering to populations who otherwise would not have considered conventional insurance.  Specific development impacts are:

Poverty Alleviation:  Microinsurance will significantly alleviate poverty by stabilizing income levels for low-income and vulnerable populations, including dampening shocks that might leave families destitute.  As a savings tool, it can contribute to wealth creation and the opening up of opportunities to this segment of the population.  It will also enable lifestyle improvements and further integration with society at large.

Demonstration effects:  The project will demonstrate the business case for microinsurance and for microinsurance investment vehicles and encourage other private sector players to invest in this sector.  It will accelerate the build-up of local capacity and broaden professionalism in the sector.","","","","",This project is engaged in supporting micro-insurance business and has been classified as a Category C project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

In addition to hydro-power generation, BPC is involved in rural electricity distribution and engineering and consulting services to hydropower and other infrastructure projects in Nepal. 

The Andhi Khola Hydroelectric Project is a run-of-river installation located in Syangja District in western Nepal constructed by a development agency  the United Mission to Nepal  with second-hand equipment provided by the Norwegian government and commissioned in 1991.  The project was originally conceived, and continues to operate, as a developmental anchor for rural electrification, irrigation and small enterprise development initiatives in Syangja District.  BPC proposes to upgrade the installed capacity of the existing project ('the Project') from 5.1 MW to 9.4 MW by: installing new generation and electro-mechanical equipment in the underground powerhouse; increasing the volume of water diverted to the powerhouse by increasing the height of a diversion structure in the Andhi Khola stream up river of the powerhouse by 2.3 meters and improving other headwork structures, including the expansion of the desilting basin; and enlarging the tailrace that discharges water from the powerhouse to the Kali Gandaki River.","","","","IFC's review of its proposed investment in BPC included: an assessment of the Company's internal environmental, health and safety (EHS) management capacity; a review of an Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) of the upgrading Project prepared for the national Ministry of Energy (MoE); and an assessment of the community development initiatives sponsored by BPC as an offshoot of the operations of the existing Andhi Khola project.

This is a category B project according to IFC's Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts that may result have been, or are being, avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria. 

Based on its review of project information, IFC identified potential environmental, social, health and safety risk in the following areas: environmental impacts of the project during construction and operation, including increased silt load in the Andhi Khola River as a result of construction activities; construction materials stockpiling and disposal of construction wastes, including excavation muck; the influx of construction workers and their impacts on the surrounding communities; worker health and safety in the construction and operation of the project; the acquisition of small amounts of land upstream of the project works; and, the potential disruption of the electricity and irrigation services provided by the project on communities upstream and downstream of the project.

The existing Project has been in operation for 17 years and the pattern of Project impacts has been well established.  The magnitude, extent and duration of the predicted impacts of the proposed upgrading of the project will not be significant apart from the temporary impact of construction activities.

BPC practices responsible environmental, health and safety (EHS) management to minimize potentially adverse social and environmental impacts of its operations. The Company maintains integrated systems to manage EHS performance commensurate with the level of risk associated with their operations. These systems are ISO certified and are consistent with IFC's EHS General Guidelines.","","","","",28083,"",BB - Small Hydro (<10MW) - Renewable Energy Generation,"","","",""

Thirty four percent of construction has been completed to date and the rest is expected to be finalized by December 2010. The Huachipa Consortium led by the Brazilian firm Construcoes e Comercio Camargo Correa is implementing the project, and the Nippon Koei Cesel Oist Consortium acts as the supervision engineer. The Huachipa project consists of three components: (i) water intake installations from the Rimac River, located at Huachipa in the District of Lurigancho-Chosica, at the eastern boundary of the Lima province; (ii) a water treatment plant at Huachipa, to be constructed in stages, with a nominal capacity of 10 m3/s (the first stage capacity being 5 m3/s) on the bank of the Rimac River upstream of the Atarjea plant at Huachipa, located at an altitude of 400 meters above sea level; and (iii) water conveyance pipeline installations 27 km long from Huachipa to the north zone of Lima (Ramal Norte), constructing a main water transmission pipeline, 27 km long and 5 water storage tanks, which will convey by gravity the water treated at the Huachipa plant to the north zone of Lima and will distribute it by gravity to most of the population in the north zone. Some complementary works will connect the water storage tanks constructed under Ramal Norte to the existing water distribution network, mainly to the existing 65 water tanks in the north zone. The project will benefit the population of Lurgiancho-Chosica, San Juan de Lurigancho, Independencia, Comas, Carabayllo, Puente Piedra, San Martín de Porres, Los Olivos and part of Callao, by improving water availability per day and adding new connections to the networks. Total project cost is approximately US$360 million, financed with a long-term concessional loan from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and by Sedapal´s own resources.  Sedapal asked for a short-term facility (up to 1-year tenor) from IFC for up to $65 million to overcome short-term liquidity constraints due to the accelerated timetable of the Huachipa project.The expected projects development impact are: i) improved water and sanitation services for over 2 million people, most of them low income in underserved area with little to no water service, and ii) increased potable water supply to the growing metropolitan area of Lima ensuring improved water service in the poor areas where potable water is currently available only for part of the day, iii) reduction of infant mortality in the area benefitted by the project.","","","","The scope of review of Sedapal compliance with IFC´s Performance Standards included an evaluation of Sedapal´s capacity to manage environmental and social aspects. The assessment was based on a desk review of environmental, social, labor and health and safety documents and reports made available by Sedapal and the Huachipa Consortium; and interviews with key management personnel of Sedapal including the Huachipa Consortium (Construcoes e Comercio Camargo Correa - OTV) and Nippon Koei Cesel Oist. In addition, an environmental and social consultant team visited the water treatment plant (construction in process), tunnels and the underground water transmission lines.In collaboration with Sedapal, the IFC will engage a resettlement expert to perform a compliance audit of the resettlement process to date. Depending of the outcome of this audit, a corrective action plan will be agreed with the Company outlining any complementary measures to achieve compliance if need be.","","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure, because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result, which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines and/or design criteria.

The Project consists of an investment in a senior loan of up to EUR30 million to the Bank for up to 5 years and is one element of an umbrella facility which IFC will provide to NLB.  This umbrella facility represents IFC's commitment to support its existing relationship with NLB Group, an emerging bank with banking and leasing operations in regional markets key to IFC, as well as IFC's commitment to support SME financing in the Republic of Macedonia.","","","","","","The proposed IFC investment will support SME lending activities of the Bank in a rather underdeveloped market such as the Republic of Macedonia.  In this country, where private sector credit/GDP is at significantly lower levels compared to EU, IFC will contribute to expanding access to term finance and support SMEs' capital investment plans.  The SME sector is an important driver of the Macedonian economy still offering attractive growth opportunities. Increased availability of term financing through the domestic banking sector will support private sector credit growth.

As the Republic of Macedonia is a former Yugoslav republic, the Project will signal IFC's confidence in the long-term prospects of the country's banking sector and economy and will help strengthen the country's standing as an investment destination.  In the short-term, IFC's liquidity support will buttress the market's confidence in the Bank's standing and credibility.

The Project is a good example of IFC's strategy to support intra-regional investments by NLB based in Slovenia, a transition country (albeit one that is now an EU member), into other countries in its region. The successful implementation of the Project will help an experienced strong local sponsor to grow further as a regional player, and facilitate transfer of capital and modern banking practices from Slovenia into the lesser developed markets, such as the Republic of Macedonia. At the same time, the Project supports a key player in the Macedonian banking sector to weather the ongoing global economic crisis and to continue providing essential funding to an economy, which has suffered under the effects of the worldwide crisis.","","","","","This project has been classified as a Category FI project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

By providing insurance for insurance companies, reinsurance companies support the industry in managing its business more effectively in the context of risk, uncertainty and volatility of insurers' underlying underwriting and business activity.  In addition, reinsurers also provide expertise and services to primary insurers, especially in the fields of product development, pricing, underwriting and claims management.  This is particularly useful in developing markets where access to insurance skills may be limited and costly. In recent years, reinsurers have additionally served as an invaluable source of capital relief and flexible financing not otherwise available to insurers, other than reverting back to shareholders.

The Company is an established regional player that is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years as a result of the strong management team and market growth potential.  The proposed project supports the development of the insurance and reinsurance sectors in the Latin American and Caribbean regions through an investment package that will enable an experienced regional player to further expand and provide a broader range of products while also improving its corporate governance standards. This project is expected to strengthen the capital structure of a regional reinsurance player active in over 20 countries; and to support the Company's growth throughout the regions.","","","","","","Developmental impact of the Project is expected to be strong in the following areas:

Expand the availability of insurance services throughout the regions, which are underserved by global insurance players;

QBEDIR is comprised of reinsurance, insurance, brokerage and dental service operations and has generated net written premiums of approximately $100 million in 2009.  The equity of the Company as of end-2008 was $72 million.  QBEDIR's business model is based on serving small to medium sized local insurance companies in Latin America and the Caribbean, where its technical expertise is sought out.  The Company's management maintains a clearly-defined strategy, driven by a proven ability to identify and exploit market niches, especially through retail insurance solutions that are targeted to improve quality of life among lower and middle-income population.

QBEDIR is associated with QBE Insurance Group and is managed by domestic shareholders. The main sponsor is Ramón Fernández, who together with the Company's management group controls 60% of the Company and has ample experience in the reinsurance sector having worked for the Company for about two decades.  Furthermore, the two additional members from the management buyout in 1993 (Gilberto Vega and Ricardo Batista) continue to operate at a senior management level and provide continuity.

While the Pando dam will have storage for sediment transport from the upper basin for an estimated period of not more than 5 years, it will also have a sluiceway structure for removing sediment that may collect in the vicinity of the power intake. Gross head of the scheme is estimated at 280 m.Monte Lirio would be immediately downstream of Pando with a catchment area of approximately 275 km2. This development includes a 15 m high by 46 m long dam, total capacity of 90,000 m3, and a total surface area of approximately 1,500 m2, a tunnel with a 3.2 m diameter and 8.2 km length; a 65.5 m high oscillation tank, penstock of 2.69 km long and diameters of 2.8 to 2.2 m, and a powerhouse with 52 MW of installed capacity split in two units. Gross head of the scheme is estimated at 314 m. Additionally, the Project also involves the construction of a 19 km of 230 Kv TL from the plant to an interconnection substation with the Central American Interconnection System (SIEPAC).The project is being developed by Electron Investment, S.A. (the Company or EISA), a SPV formed by Spanish and Panamanian investors.","","","","IFCs appraisal of this project consisted on an extensive desk review of EHS information, including the revision of two Environmental Impact Assessments for Pando and Monte Lirio, respectively, as well as two reports with complementary information. Additionally, during the appraisal visit, a fairly advanced EIA for the transmission line (TL) was also reviewed. The Lenders hired Hatch as the Independent Engineer and Environmental, Social and Health and Safety Consultant to provide support during the appraisal.Furthermore, the Project Team together with Hatchs consultants and the teams of other Lenders, performed a visit to the project site, held meetings with EISA, and with representatives from the local Environmental Authority (ANAM). Since construction has not started yet, during the site visit, the Lenders team inspected the project sites, including the future location of the reservoirs, regulating tanks, penstocks, the power houses, the tunnels openings, and the construction camps.Additionally, in late September IFC environmental and social specialists visited the project site for a second time. The purpose of this second visit was mostly to document Broad Community Support and Free Prior Informed Consultation (BCS/FPIC) and assess progress on the development and implementation of the Community Relations and Engagement Plan and appropriate socialization of the project.After the site visits, the Lenders EHS team has been in constant communication with the Sponsors EHS team to be able to clarify information, and assure the Sponsor generates adequate data and develops the appropriate EHS plans and procedures to assure timely compliance with the IFC EHS PS, and other Lenders EHS policies and procedures. Leading to Board Approval, financial closing, and first disbursement, the IFC will continue with its ongoing monitoring and review of the deliverables required under the Environmental and Social Action Plans (ESAPs) agreed with EISA, including but not limited to the EHS management framework, continued disclosure and consultation process, TL EIA approval, finalization of the land acquisition, and transmission line right-of-way easement process, among others.","","","","","","","","","","","","The project implies a fairly limited direct footprint, localized to the sites where the dams and power houses will be built and the approximately 26 kilometers of river where the natural water flow will be affected.

Pando Montelirio,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Panama,Electron Investment SA,Regional Industry - INF LAC,2009-11-24T05:00:00Z,2010-01-28T05:00:00Z,A,Risk Management,"The Pando and Monte Lirio power projects comprise a hydroelectric power development on the Chiriquí Viejo River ('CVR') in Western Panamá. The Project involves the construction of two run-of-river hydroelectric power plants to be operated in cascade, totaling 85 MW in installed capacity (Pando, 33 MW and Monte Lirio, 52 MW) and 57.4 MW in firm capacity.  The Project is expected to produce on average approximately 430 GWh per annum.

The Project is being developed by Electron Investment S.A. ('EISA' or the 'Company), a Panamanian company.","","","","","","Decreased emissions through the displacement of fossil-fuel powered generation:  The Project will displace liquid fuel based generation that currently provides marginal pricing in Panama.  This will help reduce local air pollutants (principally SOx and NOx), improve air quality for the local population, reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to climate change mitigation globally. The Project will also lower the cost of production in the Panamanian and regional grid by displacing more expensive diesel-fired generation

Satisfying the growing regional power demand:  Power demand in Central America is expected to grow at a compounded annual rate of around 4.1% in the coming years, resulting in large new power generation investment needs.  The Project will clearly contribute to reduce the regional power infrastructure investment gap.

Lower dependency on thermal power:  The dependency on thermal generation in the Central American region has increased substantially since the 1990's when most of the installed capacity was renewable (mainly hydro).  Furthermore, a large component of the expected additional capacity to be constructed in the near term in the region is expected to be thermal.  The Project will hence also contribute to reduce the region's growing dependency on thermal power.

Employment generation:  The Project will generate direct and indirect employment in the Project's area. During construction peak, it is expected that about 700 jobs will be created directly in connection with the construction of the Project. Additional employment will in turn help boost economic stimulus in the area.","","","","","The Project implies a fairly limited direct footprint, localized to the sites where the dams and power houses will be built and the approximately 18 kilometers of river where the natural water flow will be affected.

The region contains almost all of the limited Chilean oil and gas reserves.
GeoPark has invited IFC to consider an equity investment as unincorporated joint venture ('UJV') partner for a 15% working interest in the Otway and Tranquilo exploration blocks, located in the Austral basin, in close proximity to GeoPark's Fell Block. The Project will be carried out through UJVs governed by Joint Operating Agreements among the UJV partners and IFC. Current participation in the two exploration blocks, Tranquilo and Otway, is as follows: Tranquilo Block: GeoPark Magallanes (30%), Pluspetrol Corporation of Argentina (30%), IPR Energy of USA (20%), and Manas Petroleum of Switzerland (20%); Otway Block: GeoPark Chile (33.6%), Wintershall of Germany (33.6%), Pluspetrol (20%), and Methanex Corporation of Canada (12.8%).
GeoPark Magallanes Limitada, GeoPark's wholly owned subsidiary is the operator of both blocks. 

Historically, the Blocks have tested and produced gas; however, currently there is no oil or gas production (except for a small gas field, Tranquilo, located in the northern part of the Tranquilo Block and operated by the state-owned company, ENAP). No reserves have been independently appraised in the Blocks. Phase I of the Project (three years) entails further appraisal of the Blocks which will include 2D/ 3D seismic programs and eight exploration wells. Phase II (two years) may involve further development and additional exploration within the Blocks.","","","","The review of this project consisted of an appraisal mission in September 2009 to GeoPark's assets in Chile and review of technical, environmental and social information.

Discussions with GeoPark on key environmental and social aspects of their assets in Chile; An overview assessment of environmental and social issues, community engagement and development activities to date; Field visits to the Otway and Tranquilo blocks  in Chile; andMeetings with  the  Mayors of Rio Verde, Villa Tehuelches and Puerto Natales.","","","","","","","","","","","","This project is a Category B according to IFC's Policy for Environmental and Social Review of Projects. The current project involves the seismic phases for the Otway and Tranquilo blocks, thus the impacts will be short term and localized to the areas where the seismic lines would cross the fields. The key social, environmental, health and safety issues associated with this project include the following:

Temporary disruption to the sheep rearing activities in the ranches known as 'estancias';
Management of contractors for the different seismic activities;
Opening of the seismic lines and clearing of vegetation; 
Emergency procedures and employee training;
Community safety from increased road traffic and potential for vehicular accidents;
Potential migration as and when the project progresses to development stage; 
Environmental liabilities from previous operators; and
Potential impacts to livestock from existing open pits associated with exploration activities undertaken by the previous operators of the blocks. 

All of the above issues have limited adverse social or environmental impacts that are site specific and readily addressed through mitigation measures described in the attached Environmental and Social Action Plan.  GeoPark has an integrated Environmental, Health and Safety and Social Management Plan and has already established procedures and processes for the Fell block in Chile. GeoPark is currently in the process of developing specific procedures for the Otway and Tranquilo blocks. 

For the seismic activities, the project will result in temporary economic displacement. However, if the exploration blocks prove to be viable and the project reaches commercial development, land may be required permanently for development of project facilities.  In such case, GeoPark will develop a Land Acquisition and Compensation Framework for permanent land acquisition.","","","","",28614,"",AA - Oil and Gas Exploration,"","","",""

GeoPark Magallanes is the operator of both blocks.","","","","","","Fit with World Bank Group Strategy

The World Bank Group's ('WBG') 2007-2010 Country Partnership Strategy for Chile has been developed to meet the changing needs of a globally integrated middle-income country and assist the country in its efforts to (i) accelerate sustainable growth and (ii) increase equality of opportunity.  While Chile has not been reliant on World Bank financing given its strong financial position in recent years and investment grade status, the Government of Chile ('GoC') values continued World Bank engagement as a knowledge partner.  Within the integrated WBG strategy, IFC continues to focus on areas where it can support the GoC in its development objectives of encouraging growth and competitiveness, with emphasis on projects with strong demonstration effect in sectors identified as high priority by GoC, including, increasingly, energy and gas development.  In the oil and gas sector, IFC aims to provide long term strategic support to companies that seek to attain international standards in their operations, including environmental and social practices, and help the countries of their operation develop domestic natural resources in a sustainable manner. 

Development Impact

The Government of Chile has set up a priority of developing the country's energy resources and the public tender in 2007 of ten blocks was a significant step in this process, as well as in the Government's aim to achieve greater energy security. IFC's investment in this initial exploration stage will help signal to the private sector the importance of development in this region. If the Project progresses successfully to commercial production it is expected to have the following development impacts:

Increased development of domestic sources of energy. If the joint venture is successful in its exploration efforts, the Project will help support the Government's objective to both increase and diversify its domestic energy sources and suppliers. It will help maximize the use of local natural resources, in particular through exploration and potentially development of natural gas, a cleaner source of fuel, and potentially contribute to development of local industries and downstream activities.
Employment and local community development. Outside of Punta Arenas, the capital of the Magallanes and Antártica Chilena region, employment opportunities are rather limited.  If successful, the Project is expected to help sustain and generate additional employment opportunities in the area. The UJV partners are expected to benefit from GeoPark's knowledge of the region's socioeconomic condition, given that the company's Fell block is located in the same region.
Benefits to the government.  The GoC is expected to benefit from fiscal receipts, such as hydrocarbon production share in the form of royalties and corporate taxes, generated by the Project.  The Contracts state that the operator will pay 17% income tax if the funds are re-invested in the Project, and 35% income tax if there is no re-investment or if funds are repatriated abroad.

Local and regional spending.  The Project is expected to contribute to increased local and regional spending as the majority of oilfield services and operational supplies are expected to be procured locally and regionally. 

The following development outcome indicators will be monitored on an ongoing basis during the exploration phase: (i) investment and work commitments; (ii) discovery of hydrocarbons that can be commercially developed.","","If the Project progresses to commercial production, it is expected to generate development benefits through payments to the Government of Chile in the form of royalties and taxes. In evaluating this investment, IFC took into account governance and other risks to these potential benefits. Specifically, IFC considered a range of governance metrics, including the World Bank Institute's Governance Indicators and the Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index (CPI), as well as the World Bank Group's relationship with the Government of Chile. In the 2008, CPI, Chile was ranked 23 out of 180 countries. Chile is generally considered to have strong governance capacity, including with regard to management and use of revenues. Having considered the potential benefits and governance risks, IFC believes that the Project should be supported.","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Policy for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because it has limited adverse social or environmental impacts that are site specific and will largely be reversible and readily addressed through mitigation measures. GeoPark is an existing IFC client and its current operations in Argentina and Chile (Fell Block) are in compliance with the Performance Standards, the ESRR for the existing project is B-2-Average.GeoParks activities will take place in scarcely populated areas with the nearest town center, Punta Arenas, located within the Otway block. The main prospects in Otway are approximately 50 km from Punta Arenas. Tranquilo Block border is approximately 30 km from Punta Arenas, but the main prospects located approximately 110 km from Punta Arenas. Current land use on the blocks involves large sheep raising ranches called estancias and the majority of the projects activities will take place within these areas. The project activities will include seismic surveys and possible exploration drilling that will result in increased road traffic, possible increase in migration and disruptions to estancia activities. Potential impacts to sheep raising activities can be avoided and/or minimized through adequate planning of project activities with the estancia owners and adhering to international best practices and guidelines. The project is not expected to result in permanent livelihood loss and/or decrease in production.The Tranquilo and Otway blocks have environmental liabilities that pre-date GeoParks activities and which will be addressed by the Chilean national oil and gas company, ENAP.  GeoPark conducted a rapid assessment, which identified the existence of environmental liabilities in both the Tranquilo and Otway blocks. In the Tranquilo Block, the 20 identified environmental liabilities included 2 high (logging, drilling waste, hydrocarbons), 14 moderate (primarily scrap metal) and 4 low liabilities. In the Otway Block, the 30 identified liabilities included 5 high (solid waste, hydrocarbons), 19 moderate (scrap metal, septic), 4 low and 2 none.

These assets are for the most part, community-owned and operated, and provide potable water to the community members at an affordable cost. Typically, the land is provided by local government or by a donor, which also in many instances provides the equity contribution for the WHC.  The operations of each WHC, including the salaries of employees, are expected to be entirely sustained through affordable user fees generated from sales of treated water. In addition to the physical assets, the Company also provides: 

- technical skills and training to operators; 
- maintenance support for equipment; 
- oversight on adherence to quality system; 
- assurance on product/water quality; and
- public information on safe drinking water to surrounding communities.

In rural settings, a typical WHC sources water from a village pond, which has been earmarked by the local government for drinking water purposes.  Water is pumped from the pond to the WHC through buried high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes. Water treatment and disinfection involves filtration through pressure sand filter, activated carbon filter, cartridge filters of 5 and 1 micron size, activated carbon cartridge filter and UV irradiation (for disinfection).  Treated water is stored in stainless steel tanks and dispensed through a tap manifold to reusable 'food grade' HDPE containers of various sizes. WHC operators disinfect and rinse containers turned in by customers prior to refilling.  In urban and peri-urban settings, the raw water may be sourced from ground water and even municipal water supplies.","","","","IFC's review of this proposed investment in WaterHealth International Inc. (WHI) consisted of appraising technical, environmental and social information made available by each of the Company's affiliates in India, Philippines and Ghana, including: 

- Business plans;
- Quality system manual and standard operating procedures; 
- Human Resource (HR) policies;
- sample product/treated water quality test reports; and
- sample material safety data sheets. 

IFC's appraisal team also considered the performance of WHI's India affiliate WaterHealth India, Limited (WIPL) since IFC's initial investment in that affiliate through its compliance with that investment's Environmental and Social Action Plan.  In addition, the appraisal team made site visits to affiliate operations in Manila, Philippines and Accra, Ghana and interviewed the management and staff of those operations.","","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFC's Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of environmental and social impacts may result that can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards and guidelines.

The environmental and social impacts/issues associated with this project include:

Requirement for a corporate social and environmental management system (SEMS) for managing social and environmental impacts associated with the Company's projects and operations (including procedures for obtaining assurance on water quality, managing competition for common water resource, product hygiene, monitoring, reporting, community engagement and community participation); 

Capacity to implement the corporate SEMS effectively across countries, subsidiaries and operations; capacity and staffing both at corporate and in various subsidiaries/country operations to undertake projects and operations in a manner that is consistent with IFC Performance Standards; 

Requirement for procedures to ensure fair, safe and healthy working conditions (both for employees and contract workers) in a manner consistent with PS 2 provisions across all of its operations; procedures in place to ensure compliance with host country labor law requirements in each of its operations in various countries; and

Management of discharges and wastes from water treatment facilities; and community health and safety as regards water quality and hygiene and waste management/disposal.","","","","",29090,"",BA - Water and Wastewater Utilities,"","","",""
Eurasian Minerals Inc.,Investment,Environmental Documents,Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Haiti,Eurasian Minerals Inc,Energy & Mining - Global Infra,2009-12-08T05:00:00Z,"",B,Other,"Eurasian Minerals (EMX.V) is a Toronto-listed, Vancouver-based minerals exploration company working on a diverse portfolio in multiple locations (Haiti, Turkey, Kyrgyzstan, Romania, and reviewing prospects in other locations).  The company strategy is to acquire prospective ground, generate targets, and then farm out the exploration to others (i.e. a JV partner) in return for cash, retaining (carried) interest, or net smelter return.  The JV partners that EMX is currently working with are established mining companies Newmont (USA), Centerra (Canada) and Chesser (USA). Current and planned exploration activities mainly comprise initial exploration reconnaissance (with drilling to follow as warranted by reconnaissance results) by Newmont in Haiti at Gran Bois and La Miel, and continued surface drilling in Turkey at Sisorta by Chesser and at Akarca by Centerra. On other properties in Haiti and other prospects in Turkey, EMX will continue to undertake the mapping, soil sampling and trenching activities. EMX anticipates significant exploration efforts on its Haiti properties in the near term, and hence IFC has focused its due diligence on these properties.

Eurasian's projects and/or the projects in which Eurasian has a minority interest are all in their early stages and the most common activities consist of geological mapping, soil sampling and trenching activities, small infrastructure, and in some cases of further exploration drilling, as well as the completion of pre-development studies. Therefore at this time it is not certain or possible to tell if any of the projects will actually proceed to mine development. Eurasian Minerals holds interests in other prospects, but these other prospects are either at a very early stage or effectively put on hold with limited or no current impacts. Eurasian's projects in Kyrgyzstan are currently on hold.  

The Treuil and La Miel properties are in the planning stage and are Newmont designated projects where only exploration level work is being done. The parties are seeking approvals for a Mining Convention and permits for drilling, but current activities are limited to reconnaissance with minimal surface disturbance up to and including trenching.","","","","IFC's Environmental and Social ('E&S') due diligence for the proposed equity investment in Eurasian Minerals Inc. ('Eurasian', 'EMX' or the 'Company') has been conducted at both corporate level and project level.  An environmental specialist and two social development specialists undertook an appraisal of the projects in Haiti and Turkey and interacted with the Company's consultants and management team on the project details, development plans, the environmental and social baseline studies, consultation conducted to-date, and any updates required thereafter.  

IFC staff carried out a detailed, 5-day E&S appraisal visit in June 2009 of the three main exploration properties in Haiti: La Miel, Gran Bois and Treuil. The second part of the appraisal consisted of a 4-day visit in July 2009 of the two main exploration sites in Turkey: Sisorta and Akarca. Additionally, discussions took place from July to September 2009 with Eurasian senior management and its joint venture ('JV) partners to discuss how best to implement the Environmental and Social Action Plan ('ESAP' or 'Action Plan'). 

The key objectives of the visits and meetings were to: 
Assess compliance of exploration activities with IFC requirements; 
Agree on an ESAP that reflected the Company's business model and finalize an agreed implementation schedule; 
Taking into account that EMX is working as a minority partner under separate joint venture agreements with different companies for different projects, assess next steps required for EMX and each respective partner for further exploration work and potential future mine development; and
Work with EMX to explore and define potential mechanisms through which IFC E&S standards may be met under such joint venture arrangements.

The focus of the appraisal was on a preliminary E&S assessment and review of available E&S data for the various sites, the adequacy of documentation (including initial results of exploration works such as trenching, drilling and geophysics, as well as E&S policies and management systems), and the identification of any gaps and actions necessary for EMX to meet the requirements of IFC's Performance Standards. Much information has been provided by EMX since 2006, allowing IFC to undertake a detailed review of key strategic documents and corporate policies. 

During the appraisal, and in subsequent discussions with Eurasian senior management and JV partners, the IFC team highlighted the need to address future challenges early on, especially with regards to community relations, as the various projects progress through exploration works to potential development of mining operations. Eurasian's Health, Safety, Environment, Community and Labor ('HSEC/L') management, organization, and systems at the country level were examined and discussed extensively, as well as how current JV partners manage HSEC/L issues, with a focus on how to progress on the most advanced projects (Gran Bois and Sisorta). These discussions included policy and staffing requirements for Eurasian's HSEC/L corporate function, and the development of adequate environmental, safety and social capacity with current JV partners at the country level to manage exploration activities as they expand. Eurasian has agreed to further develop the initial systems-based approach to comprehensively address HSEC/L management and on-going relations with stakeholders.","","","","","","","","","","","","The main driver for IFC's equity investment is to support Eurasian's exploration projects in Haiti (Treuil, La Miel, and Gran Bois) and in Turkey (Sisorta and Akarca), and to set corporate benchmarks for sustainable resource development in those two countries.  The investment will be used primarily to fund continued exploration drilling of Eurasian's mineral resource properties in Haiti, including feasibility studies, environmental and social impact assessments, and other preparatory activities. Health, Safety, Environmental, and Community/Labor ('HSEC/L') issues, both positive and negative, will be further assessed, if and when, the proposed projects move into development of mining operations.

The Corporate HSEC/L management process has been reviewed with Eurasian executives in the context of their 'project generator' framework of current and future exploration projects, where they become, over time, a minority partner with another mining or exploration company taking over the JV management role for a designated property. Eurasian has recently developed a set of HSEC/L policies that are being implemented. Current management of HSEC/L issues by Eurasian has been assessed as being broadly consistent with international good practice and IFC Performance Standards, and an agreed Action Plan is being implemented to close gaps and ensure on-going compliance with these standards.

EMX has agreed to meet IFC E&S requirements for those projects for which they have management control. For future JV projects, EMX will conduct due diligence on the proposed projects in order to assess compliance with IFC Performance Standards. Where a project does not meet such standards, EMX will use reasonable efforts to have the JV partner implement an Action Plan which specifies actions and target completion dates for a project to be compliant with IFC Performance Standards. If the proposed project materially contravenes the Performance Standards in a manner that cannot be remediated through an Action Plan, the Company will not enter into a joint venture agreement. Regarding EMX's current JV partners where JV agreements are already in place, the Action Plan states that EMX will undertake reasonable efforts to work with its JV partners to implement the Action Plan activities.
 
This investment is expected to have beneficial impacts on local employment, contribute to improving the livelihoods of adjacent communities, and promote HSEC/L best practice. Initial information and documented material has already been publicly disclosed locally.  

The key environmental, social, and occupational health & safety and community issues associated with this project include:

Corporate level:
Social and environmental  management;
Labor and working conditions; and
Community health, safety, and security. 

Project level: 
Social and environmental management (Eurasian or JV partner);
Exploration activities: dust and noise control, water management including drainage, trenches, drilling pads and access roads rehabilitation, use of forested and agricultural land for exploration and development, occupational health and safety, visual impacts and community safety; 
Impacts on adjacent communities: traffic, land acquisition and economic displacement; and emergency preparedness and response; and
Development of adequate social and environmental assessment (baseline and impact assessment) when required. 

Future projects may have additional impacts on biodiversity, local communities, or cultural property  this will be assessed on a case by case basis after baseline work is completed, and appropriate mitigation measures will be planned and implemented. Documentation relating to social and environmental baseline, social and environmental assessment ('SEA'), social and environmental management systems ('SEMS'), and community engagement will be undertaken in accordance with IFC PS requirements.

This is a Category B project according to IFC's procedures for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because the project only involves exploration, and therefore has limited adverse impacts and risks which are manageable.  This categorization evaluates actual project risks, where the project is defined as the scope of work funded by IFC's investment.

(EMX or the Company),  is a TSX Venture Exchange listed junior mining company focused on early stage precious and base metal exploration in northern Haiti and Turkey. EMX also has equity or royalty interests in early stage projects in Eastern Europe and Kyrgyz Republic.  The Haiti prospects (Lamine, La Miel and Grand Bois) fall under a joint venture agreement with Newmont Ventures Limited, a subsidiary of Newmont Mining Corporation. The two main projects in Turkey, Sisorta and Akarca, fall under joint ventures with Chesser Resources Limited and Centerra Gold Inc respectively. Exploration in Haiti started in 2006 and the Company has not yet started drilling. The Company has started drilling at Sisorta and Akarca and has produced initial resource estimates. All EMX projects are early stage exploration and at this time it is not certain or possible to tell if any of the projects will actually proceed to mine development. Development of a mine, if it happens, is not expected to be completed for at least five or more years.","","","","","","The proposed IFC investment in exploration stage projects would not result in any immediate incremental production and the development impacts during this stage are expected to be limited. Local employment in an extremely poor part of Haiti is expected to be the main direct development impact during this phase. Indirectly, the advancement of exploration projects in Haiti could also have a positive impact of attracting additional foreign investments to an underdeveloped but promising sector of the Haiti economy.Because the investment predates advanced exploration and feasibility studies, it is not yet possible to fully quantify or specify the potential development impacts during any possible mine development or production. If continued exploration eventually leads to mine development and production, the development impacts for Haiti could be substantial and include both revenues/foreign exchange contribution to the national economy and development of vital transportation/energy infrastructure that would improve possibilities for other economic activities.","","Poor governance in Haiti creates risks to the successful progress of exploration activities in Haiti as well as to the realization of the development impacts of a potential future mine operation. In light of the potentially very large positive development impacts for the country, IFC assesses the governance risks to the projects to be acceptable. The governance situation and government capacity in Haiti have improved over the last couple of years and this trend is expected to continue.  Mine development is at least five or more years away, allowing time before any tax or royalty payments would be made to the government. The Company is committed to good governance and transparency and will disclose all payments made to the Government. Transparency of sector regulation is strengthened by that mining concession agreements are made publicly available on the Government of Haitis homepage.","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs procedures for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because the project only involves exploration and therefore has limited adverse impacts and risks which are manageable.

EDL was corporatized in 1986, remaining wholly owned by the Government of Lao PDR ('GoL'). Rapid expansion of rural electrification is one of the key priorities of the GoL for the power sector. GoL has been implementing the Rural Electrification Program with support from the World Bank. Under REP phase-I (REP-I), the EDL investment aims to provide electrification to about 42,000 households in 540 villages of the central and southern provinces (Khammouane, Savanakhet, Champasack, Saravan, Sekong, and Attapeu) during 2006-2010.  The subprojects (survey, design, construction, and installation) have been carried out by the Electricity Construction and Installation (ECI), a state owned enterprise, through an existing contract between EDL and ECI.  ECI also has their own branch offices in the provinces to carry out the tasks. 

REP-II involves extension/expansion of grid services to about 27,000 households in some 582 villages (78 subprojects) in the central and southern target provinces.  Main activities will be similar to those implemented under REP-I i.e. construction of 22 kV transmission line and 0.4 kV distribution lines, including construction of towers, pole, and/or small substations.  The implementation arrangement will also be similar to that of the REP-I. Maximum requirement for the right of way of 22 kV is 8 meters.  IFC proposes to finance grid extension project ('Project'), which will be similar in nature and scale to the REP I & II grid extension projects. 

The activities involved in IFC financed sub projects (as in case of REP I & II sub projects) would include erection of 8-14 m concrete poles for the low-medium voltage line (0.4-22 kV) of which about one sixth will be buried underground.  Poles will generally be spaced at a frequency of about 40 poles/km along existing roads and within the existing right of ways.  Step down voltage transformer will be supported on the same poles.  Small amount of land may be required for some poles and/or small substations, that have to be located outside existing right of way of roads.","","","","Electricite Du Laos ('EDL' or the 'Company') is expanding its rural electricity distribution grid through a comprehensive rural electrification program ('REP'). IFC is proposing a US$ 15 million debt to EDL to finance a part of the rural electricity distribution grid expansion program.  The exact locations where IFC funds will be invested are not known at this time  therefore the appraisal focused on the management commitment and capacity of the Company in relation to the environmental, health and safety and social issues addressed by the IFC Performance Standards.   

The appraisal comprised a review of  technical, environmental and social information submitted by the Company including: Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework ('ESSF' or the 'Safeguards Framework'), which includes a Resettlement Policy Framework and an Ethnic Group Development Framework prepared for REP Phase II (REP-II), Draft Environment Safeguards Operation Manual and Draft Resettlement Operation Manual, both together referred to as Safeguards Operation Manual ('SOM') and a number of human resources related policies and rules. The Safeguards Framework for REP-II is consistent with The World Bank Social and Environmental Safeguard Policies and has been further strengthened drawing upon the experience gained in planning and implementation of the REP-phase I project. The appraisal team also interviewed professionals from EDL's REP Project, Operations, Personnel, Environmental and Safety offices. The appraisal included a site visit to the Company's recently implemented REP-phase I project site in village Nahin and also village Nasang (proposed to be covered under REP-phase II) in Pakading district, both in Bolikamaxay province of Lao People's Democratic Republic.  

The distribution grid extension sub projects to be financed by IFC have as yet not been finalized. However, these are expected to be similar (in nature and scale) to the sub projects proposed under REP-I and REP-II. Hence, EDL will extend the scope of the Safeguards Framework for REP-II and apply the same to sub projects undertaken as part of IFC's financing package. In light of this, the focus of this review is on: social and environmental assessment, including identification of issues that need to be managed in accordance to the Performance Standards 2-8 and relevant IFC environmental, health and safety guidelines; social, environmental, occupational health and safety  (SEHS) management systems; and corporate capacity to successfully implement and monitor projects.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",28141,"",EA - Distribution Business,"","","",""

Through its 100% owned subsidiary BAFEX Tanzania Ltd., Helio can earn a 100% interest, subject to a 2% royalty (which can be reduced to 1% through a cash payment prior to commencement of commercial production) in five contiguous licences, which cover a 35km strike length of the Saza Shear Zone in the southern part of Tanzania. These licenses constitute Helio's main project, the SMP Gold Project ('the Project').  Since June 2006, the Company has drill-tested thirteen targets, ten of which are hosted by the Saza Shear Zone.  All thirteen targets have intersected bedrock-hosted gold mineralization, the most advanced being the Kenge and Porcupine Targets.  Helio also has a portfolio of earlier stage projects in Namibia.

Helio is seeking IFC's engagement to help finance the Company's exploration activities in line with industry best practice in environmental and social sustainability.","","","","","","DDespite the countryâ?s considerable mineral resources, the mining sector in Tanzania is concentrated in the north with the south overlooked since colonial times.  A number of mining juniors, however, have started to explore the south. A successful exploration could have considerable demonstration effects and help the development of a new gold district in Tanzania with the potential of spurring economic growth in the south through infrastructure development and employment generation.

The Project is in an early exploration phase so its developmental impacts are limited in scope at this stage. However, the project is located in an under-developed part of the country and outside of key centers of commercial activity and will likely contribute significantly to the areaâ?s development should it transition into a full operating mine.

â?¢	an increase in formal employment locally; 
â?¢	improved infrastructure and access to services in the District; 
â?¢	economic opportunities through downstream linkages for service providers; and
â?¢	payments to government in the form of royalties and tax.

During the early exploration phase the following indicators will be tracked to follow the projectâ?s progress relevant to development impact: (i) finalization of drilling program, initiation and undertaking of a feasibility study (subject to continued exploration success) and conversion to a mining license (subject to positive feasibility study); (ii) number of local employees; and (iii) completion of Social and Environmental Impact Assessment (SEIA).espite the country's considerable mineral resources, the mining sector in Tanzania is concentrated in the north with the south overlooked since colonial times.

The companys operations include eight clinker cement grinding plants with capacities ranging from 140,000 tons per annum (tpa), to 1.2 million tpa.  There is one plant in Benin, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Liberia respectively, and two plants in both Gabon and Ghana.   In Gabon there is also a clinker plant producing 300,000 tpa of clinker, while there is an integrated cement plant in Tanzania.  The latter facility has three kilns, although only one is currently in operation, having been commissioned in 2009.  This kiln has a capacity of 0.83 million tpa of clinker, while the two remaining kilns have a combined capacity of 0.45 million tpa.  The company is also considering investing in a new clinker plant to be established in West Africa, with the capacity still to be finalized.   The production capacity of all the plants is approximately 6.0 million tpa of cement.  Aside from the two grinding plants located in Gabon, which use locally produced clinker to manufacture cement, and the grinding mills in Tanzania which use clinker produced on-site, all the remaining grinding plants import clinker.  At the respective facilities, cement is produced by combining clinker with imported gypsum, and limestone that generally originates from local sources.   The cement produced is generally used to supply local markets, with a very limited quantity imported from time to time to supplement local production at select facilities.Recent upgrades at the various facilities include the kiln in Tanzania, and cement packaging equipment at several grinding plants.  The IFC loan would be used to further improve and replace equipment and support construction of the proposed new clinker plant in West Africa, thereby facilitating market expansion.

To maximize the economic impact of such investment, Petrobras has sought to increase local private sector participation and involvement by setting local content requirements in its drilling contracts.  These requirements are expected to spur industrial activity and linkage opportunities in-country through the establishment of new shipyard and rig related infrastructure and equipment services.

In response to the opportunities presented by Petrobras' plans above, Constellation Overseas, Ltd. ('Constellation,' the 'Company'), the oil services subsidiary of the Queiroz Galvão Group (QG) and an existing IFC client, intends to expand its oilfield drilling services business by acquiring additional offshore drilling assets that would allow it to participate in Petrobras' drilling program that is an integral part of the latter's plan to develop significant oil reserves discovered offshore Brazil.  To achieve this, Constellation is raising equity to increase its capital base.  The proceeds from this placement will be used for the construction and/or acquisition of drilling rigs, drillships and/or floating production, storage and offloading facilities (FPSOs).","","","","","","The Project offers a strong development impact:

Development of Brazil's critical energy sector:   The Project will help build greater operating capacity and will strengthen the oil and gas support infrastructure in Brazil.  Although the country has reached self-sufficiency in oil, significant new investment is needed to realize its oil and gas production potential in order to meet the growing energy demand of the country and the region.
 
Promoting domestic private sector participation:  This is consistent with the Government's objectives to widen local participation and expand the role of local companies in the oil and gas sector.  Brazil is among the few developing countries that have made a concerted effort to grow multiple local players to provide offshore drilling services.

Providing local employment, training and development of local skills:  Each rig employs an average of 144 highly skilled workers, with nearly all employment associated with rig operations comprised of Brazilian nationals.  

Generating local linkage benefits:   As a Petrobras contractor, Constellation will be bound by the local content requirements for the construction of its new rigs/vessels.  Operation of the Company's rigs will generate demand for local goods and services, estimated at about US$10 million annually for each new rig.  

Promoting competition:  Constellation's expansion into new offshore rigs will help enhance the quality of its output and thereby promote increased competition in the local drilling and drilling-related services industry.  It can help expand deepwater technology and capabilities to the sector, attract additional players to the industry, and create potentially a positive demonstration effect for similar companies and national oil companies in other developing countries.","","This project will provide drilling services to oil companies, operating in Brazil.  Its payments to government consist mainly of corporate income taxes from income derived from drilling activities.

The Project is located in the Ejidos of La Mata and La Ventosa in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, 15 km north of the city of Juchitán in the State of Oaxaca, Mexico.  The Project is configured as a line of 20 turbines in La Mata and a separate line of seven turbines in La Ventosa, both of which are approximately 2.5 km from the nearest community.   The Isthmus of Tehuantepec has one of the most prolific wind resources globally, and the Project is expected to produce approximately 290 GWh annually on average over a 10 year period, which corresponds to approximately 49% capacity utilization.  The Project is being developed under Mexico's self-supply or 'autoabastecimiento' framework and will supply its energy to four subsidiaries of Wal-Mart de Mexico S. A. B. de C.V. under 15-year self supply power purchase agreements.

Project construction is well advanced: all 27 turbines are erected, the substation and control facilities are complete and the transmission line is completed.   According to current estimates, the Project is expected to be complete and commissioned by year-end 2009.","","","","","","The Project will have a number of important benefits, including: 

(i) Supporting the Government of Mexico in its pledge to aggressively reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by  30% by 2020 and transition to a low carbon economy.  The Project is expected to generate approx. 290 GWh per annum of clean, non-fossil fuel dependent electricity generation that will displace an estimated 156,000 tCO2e per annum, leading to improved air quality and climate change mitigation; 

(ii) Contributing to economic and community development in the Ejidos of La Mata and La Ventosa, one of the poorest areas in the State of Oaxaca and Mexico.  The Project will provide an important monthly income source to the individual ejidatario landowners upon whose land the wind farm and associated transmission interconnection facilities are installed.  In addition, each of the landowners will continue to have access to and use of their land which can continue to be used for agricultural activities.  While construction is now largely complete, the Project created approx. 150 temporary local jobs under an initiative to employ local community members, including women, for unskilled labor positions during the construction phase of the Project.  In addition, EVM utilized selected construction equipment and materials, such as gravel, sourced from the local community for the Project.  Finally, in consultation and coordination with the local community, EVM will also implement and undertake a community development program following the completion of the Project to ensure continued benefits to the Ejido communities;

(iii) The Project will also have an important demonstration effect and send a market signal to global wind power developers that the Mexican wind power market is viable and ready for scale-up.  Despite the fact that the Isthmus of Tehuantepec has a world-class wind resource with average wind speeds in the 8-12 m/s range, Mexico had only 88 MW of fully-commissioned and operational wind projects at the end of 2008; with four additional wind projects (including the EVM project) completing their construction during 2009 and in various phases of final commissioning and interconnection to the Mexican power grid.   The successful completion and project financing of the incremental 67.5 MW of installed capacity of Project the will send an important signal thereby helping to catalyze and accelerate the development of wind power potential in the State of Oaxaca; and

(iv) Cumulative assessment of bird impacts will be a first in the Project geographic area and ongoing monitoring and collection of additional bird data is anticipated to eventually result in development of a standard collision risk model for avian impact assessment for the wind sector in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. This will be a significant tool for assessing wind project impacts and have a demonstration effect for the industry and would ultimately support and enable Government of Mexico policy.","","","","","The Project has been classified as a Category B project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure because it has a small total physical footprint from platforms, roads, substation and ancillary facilities (approximately 16 hectares) and limited environmental and social impacts that can be readily addressed through accepted good engineering practices.

The Project also consists of an associated substation located adjacent to the La Mata turbine row and a recently completed toll-road, and a 10-km 115 kV transmission line from the Project site to the Juchitán II substation of Comisión Federal de Electricidad ('CFE') that will run parallel to CFE's existing transmission line.  Once completed, the new transmission line will replace CFE's existing line and will be transferred to and operated by CFE.

The Project site is located in an area of agricultural farmland used primarily for sorghum cultivation and livestock grazing with small patches of low deciduous forest.  The Project layout and design has taken into consideration the ongoing land-use activities and is expected to have limited impact on the farming activities.

All land for the Project and associated facilities has already been contracted under 30-year Land Lease Agreements (Contractos de Usufructo) with the ejidatarios of La Mata and La Ventosa.","The Project has been classified as a Category B project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure because it has a small total physical footprint from platforms, roads, substation and ancillary facilities (approximately 16 hectares) and limited environmental and social impacts that can be readily addressed through accepted good engineering practices.  The Project footprint does not directly impact or touch any protected area/habitat and will physically affect less than 0.5% of total Ejido lands in La Mata and La Ventosa.  Based on migration patterns, the space above the wind farms may at times constitute natural habitat critical to migratory species, however given that there are only 27 turbines, risks and impacts to birds and bats is not considered significant.  Sections of the Isthmus, particularly coastal areas and the Sierra Tolistoque mountain range, form part of a bird migration corridor which connects the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts.  According to results of bird monitoring activities carried out in 2007 and 2008, the Projects site is not located within a high bird traffic zone in either the fall or spring migratory seasons.  The Project entails no involuntary physical resettlement and only marginal economic displacement. All land where turbines, access roads and the substation are located was formerly agricultural land and/or existing roads, and is being leased by EVM at market rates on voluntary basis. Land for the transmission line is located within a contractual right of way (ROW) and will replace an existing transmission line and entails no displacement or additional impacts.","","","","",28070,"",BC - Wind Power - Renewable Energy Generation,"","","",""

('EVM' or the 'Company'), an affiliate of Électricité de France ('EDF'),  is currently developing and constructing a 67.5 MW greenfield wind power plant that consists of the installation of 27 Clipper 'Liberty' wind turbine generators with a nominal capacity of 2.5 MW each, an associated substation and control facilities, and a 115 kV transmission line from the Project site to the Juchitán II substation of Comisión Federal de Electricidad ('the Project').  

The Project is located in the Ejidos (communally-owned lands) of La Mata and La Ventosa in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, 15 km north of the city of Juchitán in the State of Oaxaca, Mexico.  The Isthmus of Tehuantepec has one of the most prolific wind resources globally, and the Project is expected to produce approximately 290 GWh annually on average over a 10 year period, which corresponds to approximately 49% capacity utilization.  The Project is being developed under Mexico's self-supply or 'autoabastecimiento' framework and will sell its energy to four subsidiaries of Wal-Mart de Mexico S. A.B. de C.V. under 15-year self supply power purchase agreements. 

The Project is configured as a line of 20 turbines in La Mata and a separate line of seven turbines in La Ventosa, both of which are approximately 2.5 km from nearest community.  Total physical Project footprint with affect approximately 16 hectares (that is, less than 0.05% of total Ejido land in La Mata and La Ventosa). Currently, there are approximately a total 14 wind projects in different stages of development by different companies in the Isthmus, including the 250 MW EURUS wind power Project developed by Acciona, which is also being considered for IFC investment under a different operation. 

Project construction is reaching completion: all 27 turbines are erected, the substation and control facilities are complete and the transmission line is completed.","","","","Documents Reviewed:
