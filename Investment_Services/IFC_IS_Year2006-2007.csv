The sponsor, Guyana Goldfields Inc., holds 100% of the mineral exploration rights to the Aurora (14,000 acres) and Peters (8,358 acres) properties in Guyana. The company has been active in Guyana for about ten years, and it started a 10,000 meter drilling in early 2004. In June 2004, it discovered a very highly mineralized deposit at Rorys Knoll, part of the Aurora complex of deposits.

Thus, for the initial exploration project, the potential environmental issues would be limited and associated with bio-diversity, drilling sites, water resources, soils, solid and liquid waste management, vehicle impacts, handling, use and storage of hazardous materials and reclamation of exploration areas.

IFC is considering providing support to the issue of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to international investors. Under the proposed arrangement, IFC will provide credit support to the issuance of senior notes to allow the senior notes to receive an appropriate international rating.

The mortgage pool to be securitized is comprised of residential mortgages. The residential mortgages will be sold to a special purpose vehicle ('SPV') which will issue debt instruments that investors may purchase, and IFC's credit support would be in favor of the owners of these senior debt instruments. The owners of these debt instruments would own the rights to the principal and interest payments made under the residential mortgage agreements, and IFC's credit risk will depend on the underlying mortgages.

The project will contribute to development of a secondary mortgage market generally and MBS market development in Russia more specifically based on proven origination standards. The structure of the transaction is designed to be replicable, and may offer a useful template for use by other originators and arrangers for subsequent transactions. Since the Russian legal basis for securitization is also being developed, this project may also influence the domestic securitization market by establishing a market standard for MBS transactions and increased transparency.","","","","","","","","","","","Based on the available information, this is a Category C project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.

The Mining Convention covering the concession area is held by a locally incorporated Rio Tinto subsidiary, SIMFER S.A.  The proposed IFC investment is the acquisition of a 5% stake in SIMFER S.A. and future contributions to equity cash calls until completion of a Feasibility Study for the project.  IFC will also receive options to acquire 5% stakes in other Rio Tinto iron ore exploration assets in Guinea.","","","","","","","","","","","This project is a Category B according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of projects because it is an equity investment in an exploration project with limited environmental and social impacts which can be avoided or mitigate.  Since 2003 a number of environmental and social baseline studies have been undertaken, including an assessment of biodiversity of the Simandou Forêt Classée using Conservation International (CI), Fauna and Flora International (FFI) and local consultants.  Rio Tinto has based a team of environmental and social specialists in Guinea to supervise the field work, develop the SEA documentation and  interact with communities.The development phase will start upon completion of a Feasibility Study which includes detailed engineering studies, full Social and Environmental Assessments (SEA) and appropriate due diligence, documentation and stakeholder consultation prior to Rio Tintos decision to progress to construct a mine. Rio Tintos exploration and evaluation programs make use of remote sensing technology and helicopter supported field work to ensure that the environmental impacts are kept to a minimum throughout this phase of the project.  When the project reaches the development stage it will be classified by IFC as a Category A project.  Rio Tinto is committed to prepare and publicly disclose a full Social and Environmental Assessment (SEA) and an Action Plan (AP) for each deposit prior any decision to mine is taken, in line with IFC requirements.  Specific Public Consultation and Disclosure Strategies (PCDS) will also be conducted and publicly disclosed.Rio Tinto has presented plans that address the expected impacts to ensure that the proposed Project, during the exploration and developmental phases will, upon implementation of the specific measures agreed, comply with the applicable Guinean laws and regulations, IFC''s new Polices and Performance Standards, IFCs Policy on Disclosure of Information, Rio Tinto corporate policies, and industry best practice.  Overview of Environmental and Social Issues: Based on prior assessments and an IFC site visit, the potential environmental and social issues associated with the development / mining operation phase of this project include: -  major change to topography and landscape, and possible change to local orographic rainfall and surface water patterns, as the ore deposit straddles a mountain ridge of which at least a section will be removed; -  water management, including erosion and potential contamination of surface streams / aquifers; -  cumulative impacts associated with infrastructure needed to transport  iron ore; -  biodiversity conservation (including the two Forêts Classées); -  change of traditional livelihoods in the local villages (may include land acquisition/resettlement locally, and potentially with regard to establishing a rail and port facility); -  influx management at late exploration/construction stage; and -  community development around the mine site.This early stage in the project primarily focused on exploration; evaluation drilling; initial pre-feasibility work of various targets; and proposed locations of mining sites.  Production facilities and ore transportation routes will be also determined.  Once these aspects have been thoroughly assessed through feasibility studies, respective SEA documents will be prepared and publicly disclosed.  To date the project has met Rio Tintos internal E&S standards.   Mining development in the southern part of the Simandou range could have an impact on the rich biodiversity in the region.  Rio Tinto is fully cognizant of this risk and has commissioned detailed additional baseline studies and impacts assessments as part of the decision making process on any mining activities in the region. In the event that these studies identify critical habitats in areas outlined for proposed mining activities, Rio Tinto agrees to initiate an independent review of the area concerned to ensure that the requirements of the IFC new Polices and Performance Standards and the own Rio Tinto corporate policies are being met. Rio Tinto has recently finalized to IFCs requirements a Public Consultation and Disclosure Strategy (PCDS) for the project.  Currently, Rio Tinto is developing key environmental and social strategy documents on sustainable development, community, environment, biodiversity and regional development linkages, with input from IFC.

It was privatized in 2001 at which time AES Corp. purchased 56% of the shares of the company, and AES Sonel was granted a 20 year concession for distribution, transmission, and generation of electricity throughout Cameroon. The company has an installed generating capacity of 933MW comprising of 721MW hydroelectric capacity and 212MW thermal capacity (including 24MW isolated capacity). The transmission system consists of 480 km of 225kV, 337 km of 110kV, and 1,064 km of 90 kV lines and 19 substations. AES Sonel has approximately 522,000 customers of which about 79% are located in Douala (the economic hub) and Yaoundé (the capital city).The project is a corporate loan to AES Sonel to finance a portion of a comprehensive five-year investment program (2005-2009) designed to improve the companys operations and meet the objectives of the concession agreement.  The main objectives of this investment program are: -  meet concession objectives for new connections; -  improve quality of service; -  expand network capacity; -  refurbish aging generation, transmission and distribution systems; -  improve safety and environmental standards; --  reduce technical and commercial losses; -  improve work processes and management efficiency; and -  reduce fuel and variable O&M costs.","","","","","","","","","Over the last 4 years, IFC and the World Bank have been working in close cooperation in Cameroon to help address the critical needs of the electricity sector. IFC, on the one hand, is coordinating the syndicate of Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) raising the financing for a major portion of AES Sonels post-privatization investment program. The World Bank on the other hand, is helping the GOC to:-  strengthen sector institutions, -  develop a least cost generation expansion plan for Cameroon; and -  develop generation projects, such as the proposed Kribi power plant, under public-private partnership schemes. The AES Sonel investment program is expected to have a very significant development impact on the Cameroonian economy by providing incremental power supply to existing and new electricity customers. In Cameroon, the main stakeholders who are expected to benefit from the investment program are end-users (both households and businesses), the GOC, AES Sonel employees and contractors. Without the investment program, customers would be faced with load shedding, which would restrict the ability of the Cameroonian economy to grow.

It is expected that these new connections will benefit mostly urban and peri-urban middle and low income residential customers.

China Utility-Based Energy Efficiency Finance Program,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,East Asia and the Pacific,China,INDUSTRIAL BANK CO LTD,Regional Industry - FIG Asia & Pac,2006-03-28T05:00:00Z,2006-04-20T04:00:00Z,FI,Guarantee,"The proposed China Utility-Based Energy Efficiency Finance Program (the Program) entails an IFC investment of up to RMB 405 million (approximately US $50 million at todays exchange rate), in Risk Sharing Facilities (RSF) for 2-3 participating commercial banks in China to support up to RMB 932 million (approximately US $115 million equivalent at todays exchange rate) energy efficiency (EE) equipment loans, mostly to small-and-medium sized energy users.  The Program has three key developmental objectives: - Pro-active engagement with IFC portfolio and non portfolio banks in China to improve current lending and risk management practices and; - Development of SME lending capacities of IFCs portfolio and non-portfolio banks;- Promotion of the energy efficiency equipment financing market.The Program is expected to be partially funded by a grant of US$16.5 million from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and a US $3.0 million from Finlands Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI).  A large portion of the GEF funds, between US$10.0 to US$11.5 million will be used to cover IFCs RSF liabilities.  IFCs exposure on its own account will be up to RMB 312 million on the second loss risk sharing position, calculated at todays exchange rates.  The balance of GEF funding, plus the MTI bilateral donor funding, will be used primarily for engineering services, technical advisory and program management activities.  The Program will be implemented by IFCs Financial Markets Department (CGF), the Environmental Finance Group (EFG), and the China Project Development Facility (CPDF) through IFCs Beijing office.","","","","","","","","","The project is expected to generate significant development impact in Chinas financial market development, energy efficiency equipment market development and environmental improvements.  Financial Markets Development: The RSF will provide an effective credit risk management tool that will encourage banks to develop improved risk management practices, introduce new lending products and to expand coverage to under-served SME segments. Specifically, the Program and IFC RSF will enable banks to:- Assess risk and underwrite loans more on the basis of borrower cashflow and ability to pay, including the economic merits (energy cost savings) of the project being financed;- Apply risk-weighted pricing and use extra spread to cover additional risk;- Offer three to five year loan tenors (for equipment that has useful lives of 10-20+ years) and amortize loans with installment payments of principal. This reduces bank risk on the medium term balloon payment loans, and reduces borrower total interest costs;- Apply other credit enhancement methods, e.g., collections of loan payments together with utility bills with the threat of suspending utility service in loan default, debt service reserves for individual loans, and additional bank loss reserves, etc.   There is a large and relatively untapped market for equipment term loans that can be offered on these terms. The Program envisions a clear pathway to commercialization whereby banks can employ the credit risk management methods on a profitable sustainable basis without the IFC risk sharing. Energy Efficiency Development.  In addition to financing barriers, under-developed market awareness of and marketing capacities for EE equipment also hinder the development of energy efficiency equipment market.  Besides providing a financing channel, the Program will also expand marketing channels for EE equipment, educate customers, build sales capabilities of EE equipment suppliers, and enable partner utilities to reach, educate, and deliver a comprehensive set of services to a large set of energy users systematically.Environmental Improvement.  Chinas energy supply mix relies overwhelmingly on coal, a cheap but highly polluting fuel.  Chinas government is promoting a rapid increase in natural gas use as an energy supply alternative and to address chronic local environmental pollution problems.  By improving efficiency of energy use and promoting expanded use of clean burning natural gas, the Program will reduce emissions of air pollutants. In particular, the partnership with Xinao will serve medium size cities, for example, Shijiazhuang (Hebei Province) and Changsha (Hunan Province) which are highly polluted. Fit With World Bank Group Strategy and IFC Role. According to FY03-05 CAS, three main themes of the Banks operational strategy in China are to (i) improve the business environment and help accelerate Chinas transition to a market economy; (ii) address the needs of the poorer and disadvantaged people and regions; and (iii) facilitate an environmentally sustainable development process.Within this broad framework, IFC''s strategic priorities are: (i) improving the business environment, particularly as it relates to financial markets, private participation in infrastructure and SMEs; (ii) encouraging development of SMEs through capacity building, and the development of alternative sources for SME financing; (iii) helping deepen and broaden the financial sector by supporting private banking and non-bank financial institutions; (iv) supporting private sector development in Chinas western and interior provinces; (v) enterprise reform through model transactions promoting industry consolidation and restructuring; and (vi) expanding the presence of private enterprises in infrastructure, social services, and environmental technology sectors. The focus will be on model transactions that are setting standards for private sector investments in corporate governance, international accounting, environmental technologies and practices, and efficiency of operations, with the aim of creating demonstration effects and helping Chinese companies become global and internationally competitive players.  The proposed project is fully consistent with this strategy.IFC plays a critical catalyst role in bringing together local banks, partner utilities, and GEF to pioneer EE finance development in China.  IFC, with the support of GEF funding will help the participating banks to overcome the hurdle of unknown and perceived high risk of EE financing through the RSF.  IFCs other contributions will include providing technical assistance to the banks on improving risk management skills and to partner utilities on building EE marketing capabilities, as well as providing project execution support through the Program Management Office.","","This is a FI Type 1 project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure. The banks availing of the RSF must ensure that the projects supported under the facility are in compliance with applicable National Environment, Health, Safety and Social laws.

The projects construction period is estimated to be thirty months, with physical completion expected in 2009.China has historically relied on coal and, more recently, petroleum for its energy needs. In 2002, these sources made up 62% and 28%, respectively, of its total energy consumption.  This heavy utilization of highly polluting coal energy has imposed significant environmental costs on the country. In addition, increasing consumption of imported petroleum is raising concerns about Chinas energy security.  In order to address these environmental and energy security concerns, the Chinese government has initiated an energy diversification policy centered on the use of clean-burning fuels.The sponsors Xinao Gas subsidiary is a leading piped gas distribution company in China.  In a drive to increase the Xinao Groups profitability and diversify its fuel sources, the project is aimed at backwards integration into fuel generation and supply by creating a captive, lower cost supply of fuel products suitable for the Chinese retail and household market.  The project will utilize Chinas abundant and relatively low-cost coal reserves, located at one of the poorest and most underdeveloped provinces in China, to produce methanol and DME, which are environmentally friendly fuels that also have value as raw materials for downstream applications.

The long term funding gap in Nigeria has historically forced Nigerian commercial banks to rely on their capital, or take the maturity risk in order to finance longer-term projects.

As of the end of 2005, Paktel had nearly one million subscribers for a 5% market share placing it as the fifth operator out of 6 players in the market.  The project focuses on the expansion of Paktels existing GSM 900/1800 operation in Pakistan through extending coverage and enhancing network capacity. MIC and Paktel will also spend increased resources on marketing and distribution to re-establish the Paktel brand and grow market share.  The company will invest in its network in order to improve network coverage as well as enhance the quality of service.","","","","","","By increasing the availability of telecommunications services in Pakistan, the project will:- Expand access: The project will increase the availability of reliable and affordable telecommunications services for consumers and businesses. As of December 2005, mobile penetration in Pakistan was approximately 14.6% (just over 21 million mobile subscribers) and fixed line penetration was approximately 3.0% (4.5 million fixed line subscribers).  This project will enable Paktel to upgrade technology, increase capacity, and improve coverage, which will allow more consumers and businesses to have access to reliable and affordable telecommunications services in a country with very low teledensity.-  Extend geographic coverage:Paktel plans to add new sites to its network as it builds out past the main cities in Pakistan thereby extending service to the frontier and border areas of Pakistan.  - Support telecom liberalization agenda:As indicated by the telecommunications law passed in 1996 and the amendments and updates issued throughout 2003-2005 as well as the issuance of two new licenses to new entrants in 2004, the Government has committed to establishing best practices in telecommunications sector reform, including market liberalization in the mobile and fixed line sectors. The project will support private sector involvement and promote competition in the telecommunications sector which are goals of the Government. - Product & Service Innovation: Although Paktel is not the only mobile operator in Pakistan with foreign sponsors, its relationship with Millicom has resulted in several benefits including knowledge transfer for product and service innovation.  Paktel was the first operator in Pakistan to launch several services, including per second billing, and is looking to continue leading the market with innovative products and services best suited for Pakistan.  The project will enable Paktel to improve the quality and variety of services offered as its new GSM network will utilize SMS, GPRS and MMS services to enable multimedia and data applications.  - Demonstration Effect & Capital Mobilization:  As a result of past economic and political uncertainties, the climate for private sector investment in Pakistan has been challenging. The new governments efforts to improve macroeconomic management and public governance are encouraging, and an IFC investment at this time would show highly visible support for the administrations efforts to encourage private-sector investment.

Ltd. (DPL) and Rally Energy Pakistan Ltd. (Dewan Petroleum or the companies) are oil and gas exploration and production companies with a combined 60% working interest in the Safed Koh block in Punjab province in Pakistan. DPL is the operator of the block. The project involves: - the development of the discovered Salsabil gas and condensate field in the Safed Koh block, and - ongoing exploration programs towards establishing additional oil and gas reserves. DPL has also been awarded concession rights to five new exploration blocks. The project activities in these blocks will be limited to initial exploration. The project investments will: - help augment domestic availability of natural gas, and- seek to establish additional hydrocarbon reserves, addressing Pakistans growing energy needs.","","","","","","The project will support development of discovered natural gas reserves in Pakistan and further investments towards exploration for new hydrocarbon reserves in the country. The sector is critical to Pakistans economy. Natural gas, a relatively more affordable and environmentally friendly fuel, currently meets about half of the countrys primary energy needs. Increasing domestic demand is projected to lead to supply deficits with the prospect of imports in the coming years. The gas supplied by the project is a relatively clean source of fuel and will be at significantly less cost than the alternative cost of imports. In addition to contributing to increased availability of a relatively cheaper and clean fuel, the projects additional development impacts will come from outlays in social programs, estimated, based on the concession agreement, to range at least between $20,000 to $75,000 annually depending on production levels; generating jobs and providing training; and in the form of incremental revenues to the governments from royalties, production bonuses and taxes, forecast at about $137 million over the twenty year life of the projects current proved reserves based on gas prices calculated using World Bank forecast oil prices.  IFC will track the projects development benefits annually based on information provided by DPL in respect of gas production, outlays on social development programs, creation of direct and indirect jobs, and revenues paid to the government and their agencies in Pakistan.  Governance Context Payments to the government from the project in the form of royalties and taxes are expected to be small, amounting to less than 0.1% of annual federal government revenues in Pakistan. While Pakistans performance on governance reveals weaknesses as evidenced by low scores on the Transparency International and World Bank Institute indicators, the country has made considerable progress in this area. Local governments have been created to increase responsiveness and accountability for provision of key public services, the tax administration bureaucracy is being overhauled, financial reporting and auditing systems have been modernized, and institutions of accountability like the Auditor General and the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committees have been revitalized. In the hydrocarbons sector, largely managed by the federal government, new legislation and regulations have been introduced, regulatory authorities have been established, and information dissemination (through website postings etc.) has been strengthened. In addition, revenue payments made by the company to the government and their agencies will be disclosed by the company on an annual basis.  Beyond revenue benefits discussed above, the project will also benefit domestic gas users by providing gas at a cost below that of non-gas alternative commercial fuels. Mandatory investments stipulated in the concession agreement in respect of social welfare programs will be made directly in coordination with the local civil administration or the relevant provincial government. Unspent amounts are otherwise to be deposited with these agencies. The partners intend to apply these directly in suitable social development programs; these expenditures will be tracked by the company annually.In coming to a view of whether to support this project, the IFC has considered the value of all of the projects benefits, and governance and other risks to these benefits. It has also considered in this respect a range of indicators of governance, and the current level of engagement between Pakistan and the World Bank and IMF. IFC believes the risks to project benefits not being realized, due to governance in the country, as relatively small. The non-revenue benefits which are significant, such as strengthening domestic energy production and provision of relatively clean and lower cost fuel, generating jobs and direct social welfare contribution are unlikely to be impacted by weak governance. The project is also consistent with overall World Bank Group objectives in Pakistans oil and gas sector, including helping strengthen local private sector participation in development of these sectors.","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized industry practice, guidelines or design criteria.

Su Casita was established in 1994.  It has 114 braches in Mexico.

It has a servicer rating of SQ2 from Moodys - the rating ranges from SQ1(strong) to SQ5 (weak), and Excellent by S&P.Su Casitas business growth has been robust and the company expects this growth to be maintained, which calls for increased funding over the next three years.  In anticipation of these needs, IFC is considering firming up a package of up to $240 million to be able to expedite future requests for funding from the company.Within this package, a first loan of $70 million, a warehouse line of credit, will finance the origination of eligible mortgage loans, as defined by IFC, in the low- to middle-income segment of the Mexican housing market, and provide a steady pipeline of mortgage loans to support HSCs on-going securitization program.

Kappa,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Colombia,KAPPA RESOURCES COLOMBIA LTD,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2006-05-22T04:00:00Z,2006-06-21T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"Kappa Energy Holdings (BVI) Limitied (Kappa), a holding company registered in the British Virgin Islands, holds oil and gas exploration companies, one of which is Kappa Energy Colombia Limited S.A. This company has been operating in Colombia since 1997 and holds exploration and production licenses. Its main production assets are the Abanico oil field in the Upper Magdalena Valley and the Cerrito gas field in the Catatumbo Basin near the city of Cucuta. Kappa has requested the IFC to provide a corporate revolving credit facility and the IFC is also considering an equity investment, which will provide the company with financing required to grow its operations. IFC is also working closely with Kappa to help the company develop best practices in corporate governance, environmental and social management systems.","","","","","","The World Bank Group''s current strategy in Colombia, as described in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Progress Report dated September 9, 2005, proposes to support Colombias quest for peace through: -  achieving fast and sustainable growth; -  sharing the fruits of growth; and -  building efficient, accountable and transparent governance. The World Bank assistance has been centered on development policy loans to support the governments reform agenda in the fiscal, financial, environmental and social sectors. Complementing this, the World Bank has also provided investment lending and grants in education, water, transportation infrastructure, rural development, renewable energy, urban services, assistance for forcibly displaced populations, and environment and natural resource management. IFC support includes: -  the strengthening and deepening of financial sector institutions and local financial markets; -  the development of infrastructure, including potential public-private partnerships and support to sub-national entities in the provision of infrastructure, in coordination with the Bank as warranted; -  investment in extractive industries; and -  the modernization of Colombian businesses to help improve their competitiveness and support their expansion both domestically and abroad. IFCs strategy for oil and gas aims to support local medium sized companies via equity and long term financing, while assuring that the projects meet high environmental, social, governance and transparency standards.Project Development Impact:The project will support the continuing development and growth of one of the few local companies with a presence in the Colombian oil and gas industry, where multinationals such as BP, Occidental and Petrobras, as well as Ecopetrol, the state owned oil and gas company,  currently dominate the oil and gas sector. Through the exploration and development of its existing licenses and acquisition of additional acreage, Kappa will contribute to the development of Colombia''s hydrocarbon natural resources and assist the country in maintaining it''s self-sufficiency.  Specifically, the project is anticipated to have the following developmental impacts: Creation and Preservation of Direct and Indirect Employment and Training:In 2005 Kappa employed directly and trained over 60 nationals. Over 200 jobs have also been generated via local services and suppliers. The Project will benefit the local community through increased employment opportunities, both directly and indirectly. DirectBenefits to Local Communities: Kappa places importance on sustainable development and quality of life improvement for those people affected by its operations. The Company is engaged in several social development and infrastructure projects, including supporting childrens education, medical services, water sanitation and infrastructure projects. Benefits to the Government: It is expected that the Government of Colombia will receive substantial receipts from royalties, production sharing and corporate taxes, generated by the project.Gas Flaring Reduction in Abanico: Kappas development plan for the Abanico field includes the utilization of the associated gas, which is currently being flared, to generate electricity for use in the field oil production process. The company may have excess gas production or electricity generation, which will be supplied to local consumers via an electric transmission line connecting to the national grid and a gas pipeline connecting to the gas distribution system.Gas Reserves Monetization in Cerrito:The projects gas exploration and production in Cerrito supports the monetization of stranded natural gas reserves in Colombia and secures an important uninterrupted source of clean energy to the residents of Cucuta, a city with a population of over 300,000 people, located in the State of Norte de Santander.  The key development indicators that are proposed to be monitored during the life of the IFC investment are:-	direct employment levels of Colombian nationals;-	implementation of community development programs;-	revenue payments to the Government of Colombia (GOC);-	gas flaring reduction in Abanico.Transparency and Governance ContextIn coming to a view of whether to support this Project, IFC has considered the value of the projects benefits, and governance and other risks to these benefits. As mentioned above, the project is expected to generate benefits in a variety of forms. Besides employment, local community development, gas flaring reduction, monetization of stranded gas reserves and uninterrupted gas supply to the city of Cucuta, it is expected that a large share of project benefits will accrue to the GOC in the form of royalties, production sharing and taxes. The Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos (National Hydrocarbon Agency, ANH), the state regulatory agency for the oil and gas sector, publicly discloses on its website items such as: -  recent royalty information on a regional basis; and -  recent contract awards and term. Royalties paid on a regional basis are now also disclosed monthly in the local newspapers. Furthermore, to ensure transparency, all payments to the GOC will be publicly disclosed by Kappa in its website. In respect to governance, a range of governance indicators, including the current relationship between Colombia and the World Bank and IMF, have been considered. Colombia is seen as having relatively strong governance capacity in the Latin American region. In recent years, Colombia has made important progress in its Public Finance systems and improved transparency. Important initiatives include adoption of the 2002 presidential anticorruption plan, improving the administration of publicly owned banks, clarifying responsibilities for managing expenditures among different levels of government, and introducing modern accounting concepts and procedures. These initiatives were supported by the rollout of new information systems covering the budget and local government finances, as well as the monitoring of public procurement. The Government enacted an important Fiscal Transparency and Responsibility Law in 2003, and strengthened the disciplinary code for public servants. Based on the prevailing governance situations in Colombia, IFC believes the risks to project benefits not being realized, due to governance in Colombia, as relatively small.","","","","","This is a Category B project, according to IFCs procedure for environmental and social review of projects.

In March 2007, the Government of Pakistan ('GOP') through the Private Power and Infrastructure Board ('PPIB') requested UPL to submit a bid for a capacity expansion to the existing plant. The expansion was designed to utilize the supply of indigenous gas in the Uch Gas Field ('UGF') and to increase the supply of low cost power to the country. UPL proposed a 404 MW combined cycle expansion project ('Uch II' or the 'Project') on a Build-Own-Operate ('BOO') basis. All energy that would be produced by the Project would be sold to the National Transmission and Dispatch Company ('NTDC') under a 25-year Power Purchase Agreement, backed by a GOP Guarantee. An Implementation Agreement would be signed prior to financial close that would entail the GOP's support for the project and would also lay out the rights and obligations of all parties.

The proposed expansion will be structure as a standalone Independent Power Plant ('IPP') and will be built on the site of the first plant, utilizing the available vacant land, and will use some of the existing physical and management infrastructure. The project will use the indigenous gas that is available in the UGF and is being used by the first plant. In addition to the infrastructure, the project will benefit from synergies with the existing plant in the form of a shared management team as well as common utilization of O&M resources and administrative staff. The synergies are expected to result in a shorter construction period as well as reduced overall project costs which would result in a more competitive tariff for the project. Similar to the operating 586 MW Uch-I plant, the Project is expected to be one of the lowest cost producers of power in the country and would be in line with IFC's strategy to support the development of low cost thermal power and help improve sector operating costs.

The Project is expected to have solid economic and developmental impact, because it will: 

reduce the level of costly un-served electricity and meet incremental demand for power, thereby encouraging economic growth; 
create a demonstration effect in the country and help revive dampened investor confidence in light of the recent macroeconomic crisis. IFC's presence in the project would provide a signal to the international investment community and would also play a major role in attracting the interest of other financial institutions in providing funding for the project.
contribute to increase the country's much needed installed capacity using an indigenous energy  resource and thereby increase energy security of supply;
contribute to lowering the average economic cost of power generation in Pakistan; 
have significant environmental benefits compared to alternative thermal power generation fueled by liquid or solid fuels due to gaseous fuel's advantages of relatively lower generation of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants;
create jobs during the Project construction and operations phase; 
reduce reliance on imported and expensive fuel oil, reduce the drain on the country's scarce foreign exchange resources and help to offset the country's trade and current account deficits; and 
help improve the country's CO2 emissions performance, as the project is expected to make use of the most modern and environment-friendly technology (combined cycle gas turbine) with high thermal generation efficiency.","","","","","The key environmental and social issues covered during appraisal include:  (i) cumulative environmental impact assessment (air, noise, water, waste)  of Uch II and Uch I, (ii) E&S impacts of any associated facilities such as gas pipeline, transmission line, water supply, in case they need to expand for Uch II, (iii) consolidated E&S management system for Uch I and II under the planned structure of Uch II being a separate project company from Uch I, (iv) energy efficiency and GHG emissions performance evaluation, taking the UGF gas characteristics into consideration, (v) assessment of alternative options (fuel, technology, silting, cooling system, pollution control), (vi) occupational health and safety management for both construction and operational phases, and (vii) enhanced community development programs.","The Project will be established under a separate project company called Uch-II Power (Private Limited) which will be established in Islamabad and will be 100% owned by IP.

The Bank became a publicly listed company in 1989. Following the financial crisis in 1997, the Bank was taken over and recapitalized by the Indonesian government.  In late 2003 the government sold 56.8% of the Bank's shares to Sorak Financial Holdings, a consortium of foreign banks and investors led by Asia Financial Holdings (a subsidiary of Temasek Holdings - Singapore). The Bank's management control was also transferred to the consortium at the time of the sale of the equity. 

The project consists of a medium term credit facility in Indonesian Rupiah, which amount of facility will equal up to $125 million based on exchange rate value of the disbursement date to BII. The proceeds of IFC loan will be used by BII primarily to finance small and medium enterprises (SME) in Indonesia directly or through the Bank's affiliates.","","","","","","Given the scarcity of long-term financing in Indonesia, IFC's medium term funding will help BII achieve a better match of its assets and liabilities and reduce the market risks it faces in this connection. Also the engagement with IFC on issues related to environmental and social requirements will increase the awareness and sensitivity of the BII in these areas. 

At the level of the end users, the project will help BII to ramp up its commercial lending to SMEs sector. In general, SMEs in Indonesia attract about 90% of the labor force and represent more than 60% of Indonesian GDP. Unfortunately, the commercial banks' penetration to this sector is still very low. About 80% of Indonesia's SME remain underfinanced. The big barrier to penetrate the financing for SME lies on technological infrastructure to provide streamlined loan processing and control mechanism.

BII is one of the few banks, which are lending to SME sector, but due to lack of medium-term funding in Indonesia, especially in local currency, BII's expansion into the sector has been limited. The project will help make available to BII's SME customers access to medium term local currency funding, which is currently in short supply in Indonesia.","","","","","This is a category FI project under IFC''s new environmental and social review procedure.

IFC will assess BII''s capacity to manage environmental and social risks and opportunities, and will recommend ways for any gaps to be filled.

The investment program will include rehabilitation of track to allow safe passage of trains at an average of 30 km/hour; upgrading and modernization of the locomotive fleet; wheel and brake replacement and other rehabilitation of the wagon fleet; rehabilitation of passenger coaches; purchase of new locomotives and wagons; renovations of buildings, workshops, depots and machinery; and installation of new information technology (IT) systems.  In addition to IFC, RVRC is also seeking a parallel loan from KfW, the German bilateral development finance institution.RVRCs system will comprise a total track length of 2350 km (1920 km in Kenya and 431 km in Uganda), with 219 locomotives (175 in Kenya and 44 in Uganda) and approximately 7500 wagons and three water ferries (approx. 6000 wagons and one ferry in Kenya and 1433 wagons and two ferries in Uganda).  All water ferries are freight-only.

The balance of $64 million would be funded in equal amounts in the form of an A loan of  $32 million from IFC and a $32 million loan from KfW.","","","","Rehabilitation, operation and maintenance of the rail networks currently run by Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) and the Uganda Railways Corporation (URC) has been awarded to two special purpose concession companies (each a Concessionaire) set up by the Rift Valley Railways Consortium (RVRC) after an international competitive tender process.  RVRC is a holding company with 100% ownership of the two concessionaires, Rift Valley Railways Kenya Ltd. (RVRK) and Rift Valley Railways Uganda Ltd. (RVRU).  The objective of the Concessions is to improve the management, operation and financial performance of the two rail networks in a coordinated manner by granting exclusive rights to the Concessionaires for the provision of freight services in both Kenya and Uganda for the duration of the concession.  In Kenya, the Concessionaire will also be obliged to operate the passenger services as designated in the concession agreement for a minimum period of five years.  There is no existing passenger service in Uganda.  Though legally separate, the objective of the joint concession process is to seamlessly operate the two concessions as one railway system.  This is particularly important for Uganda, a landlocked country, which depends upon the Kenyan port of Mombasa for sea access.  The concessions were awarded on October 14, 2005 and formal handover of the operations of KRC and URC to RVRC is expected to take place on or after July 31, 2006. IFCs review of this project focused on the social, labor, and environmental components of the project that will be the responsibility of the private operator from the date the Concessions are formally handed over.  The Concessions, in conjunction with a Direct Agreement (yet to be signed at the time of this note), provide that all pre-existing environmental and social liabilities will remain the responsibility of the conceding authorities.  The World Bank supported the concession process as part of the East Africa Trade and Transport Facilitation Project and other initiatives.  More specifically, the World Banks engagement in this process includes: - funding the labor retrenchment process in Kenya where around 5500 current employees of KRC are expected to be retrenched, and - funding the relocation of illegal encroachers (people and businesses) on KRCs right-of-way in Kibera and Mukura in the outskirts of Nairobi.IFC is relying on support by the World Bank to ensure that its Safeguard Policies are met related to retrenchment and other social mitigation of railway staff in Kenya, as well as the relocation of people and businesses that have encroached on the rights-of-way in both Kenya and Uganda as required to provide a safe corridor for railway traffic.  As the respective governments are responsible for remediation of environmental contamination, IFCs review also considered the capacity of the private operator to support the governments in these matters and to achieve environmental compliance in a reasonable timetable.Key documentation examined by IFC as part of its review included the following:- Kenya Railways Corporation, Environmental Due Diligence, Technical and Financial Audit Report, prepared by COWI A/S, May 2005; - Uganda Railways Corporation Ltd., Major Facilities, Environmental Audit Report, prepared by SMEC International, July 2004; - Relocation Action Plan for Improving the Safety along Kenya Railway Line, October 29, 2005,- Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan for Uganda Railway Concessioning, June 2005, and- Management process documents prepared by Rift Valley Railways  Kenya Ltd (quality, railway safety, occupational health and safety, environmental, human resources, corporation, and equity and community), May 28, 2006.","","","","","","","","","","","",The key environmental and social aspects of the private-sector project include environmental management program for system renovation and operation; land use and right-of-way management and control of encroachments during system renovation and operation; liquid effluents and protection of water resources; solid and liquid waste management; risk assessment of the transportation and disposal of hazardous materials; vegetation management of the right-of-way; spill prevention and emergency response; and employee and public safety.

The tenders were awarded to two special purpose concession companies (each a Concessionaire) to be set up by the Rift Valley Railways Consortium (RVRC), which would be a holding company with 100% ownership of the two concessionaires.

IFCs strategic objective outlined in the WBG strategy is to focus on: - supporting PPI initiatives;- assisting the development of new financial sector institutions and instruments for the private sector; - catalyzing new private sector investment in manufacturing, petrochemicals, oil and gas, as well as the social sectors; and - supporting SME initiatives.In Bulgaria the objectives of WBG are to: - address productivity and employment;- implement fiscal sustainability and proper absorption of EU funds; and- target poverty reduction through social inclusion.  IFCs strategic objective outlined in the WBG strategy is to support Bulgarias EU integration by helping Bulgaria improve its competitiveness through supporting domestic companies and attracting foreign private investors in the country.  The proposed project is consistent with WBGs overall strategic priorities in these countries by developing its natural resources, attracting foreign investment and providing training and jobs, while helping the company to operate in an environmentally and socially responsible manner.- Development ImpactThe project is expected to contribute to the benefits provided by Melroses continued operations as follows:- Promoting Natural Gas Development and UseThe project will contribute to increased natural gas production in Egypt; production is expected to increase from an average 70 mmcf/d in 2005 to 200mmcf/d by year-end 2007.  Natural gas is believed to be the primary growth driver in the Egyptian energy sector.  Melroses operations support both the development of gas for domestic use and the governments strategy of promoting gas as a domestic fuel of choice.  Bulgaria has limited indigenous gas production and its domestic market for natural gas is still at an early stage of development.  The Galata field development, the first upstream oil and gas development undertaken by the private sector in Bulgaria, has supported the governments objectives to include the private sector and develop a competitive gas market.  In 2005, the company provided 16% of the natural gas consumed domestically.  The project will contribute to sustaining this positive impact on the countrys gas sector.  Moreover, it is expected that the Galata field, upon depletion, will be used as a gas storage facility, thus strengthening Bulgaria''s role as a gas transit country with its corresponding revenue generating benefits.- Creation and Preservation of Direct and Indirect EmploymentThe project will help sustain employment in both countries.  In Egypt, the operating company currently employs approximately 47 personnel and an average of 300 contractors per annum, of which more than 95% and 100%, respectively are locals.  In addition, given the large development program envisioned over the next couple of years, the project is expected generate additional employment of about 200/300 contractors per annum.  In its Bulgarian operations, Melrose employs 43 people directly and an average of 300 contracted staff per annum.  100% of direct personnel and 70% of the contracted employees are locals. - Supporting Local Communities and SuppliersThe company is committed to the local communities in which it operates, recognizing that engagement with the communities in the area of its operations is integral to the long-term success of its investments.  In Egypt, Melrose and its partner Merlon have contributed to schools, mosques and the construction of roads and other infrastructure within the concession areas.  In Bulgaria, the company sponsors a daycare center for children with disabilities by providing heating fuel during the winter months and is presently rebuilding a local church.   In addition, with the exception of specialized equipment Melrose aims to procure approximately 70% and 70% of its purchases locally in Egypt and Bulgaria, respectively.  - Benefits to GovernmentThe project benefits to Egypt and Bulgaria include continued revenues that will accrue to these governments in the form of production share, royalties and corporate taxes.  The estimated net present value of future aggregate revenues to the Government of Egypt (GoE) and Government of Bulgaria (GoB) is expected to be about $300 million and $5million, respectively, over the life of the proposed IFC investment, representing less than 0.09% and 0.01% of annual federal government revenues. (nb 2005 revenues - $9.9bn Bulgaria & $32.9bn Egypt)IFC plans to monitor the following development impacts for both Bulgaria and Egypt during the life of the IFC investment:- employment levels; - local/national purchasing;- production sharing and fiscal payments accruing to the governments of Egypt and Bulgaria; and - investments in community programs.","","The benefits of the project come in a number of forms as outlined above, including revenues to the governments in the form of taxes, royalties and other payments. In the case of Egypt, the governments share of hydrocarbon revenues partly accrues to the Ministry of Petroleum (EGPC/GPC), and for income taxes to the Ministry of Finance (MOF).  In Bulgaria, revenues accrue to the municipality of Varna and to the central government.  In coming to a view of whether to support this project, the IFC considered the value of the projects benefits, and governance and other risks to these benefits. In this respect it considered a range of indicators of governance, as well as the current relationship between the host countries and the World Bank Group. These indicators reveal a mixed picture in the case of Egypt, and an improving situation in the case of Bulgaria. The World Bank is currently engaged with the Egyptian Government on governance-related initiatives, including the introduction of performance monitoring and evaluation frameworks, and requiring a higher level of information disclosure to the public. In Bulgaria, governance and the strengthening of institutions are at the forefront of the governments policies. The World Bank is involved with the Bulgarian Government to further strengthen public administration capacity, improve the quality of service delivery, reduce corruption, strengthen accountability and transparency, and, importantly, increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the judicial system. To ensure transparency Melrose has agreed to publicly disclose all revenues paid to government authorities on an annual basis.","","","This is a Category B project because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines and the corrective action plan.At the parent company, Melrose has committed to develop and implement an integrated Health, Safety, Environment and Corporate Social Responsibility Management System (HSEMS).

COOP-EST will be incorporated as a corporation under Belgian law. COOPEST aims to attract investments from cooperative banks and multilateral and social investors to reach, via multiple closings, a size of 30 million. The first closing is expected to be 15 million.COOP-EST will be set up as a three tier structured vehicle (the facility) comprised of three bond tranches, as per the following proposed characteristics: - Junior A notes for up to 6 million, representing  20% of the issue;- Mezzanine B notes for up to 9.0 million, representing 30% of the issue; and - Senior C notes for up to 15 million, representing 50% of the issue.The junior A notes will act as the first loss cushion and be fully subordinated to the B and C notes. The main sponsors (see below) will invest up to  8 million in the project, subscribing to all the A bonds and smaller portions of the B and C bonds.  It is proposed that IFC invest up to 4 million in B notes alongside EBRD. The project sponsors have sought the support of Soficatra, a Belgian investment management and consulting company that specializes in project finance at the community level, financial engineering, and consultancy on mergers and acquisitions.  Soficatra plans to invest 1.0 million, with the same allocation between A and C notes as the founding partners.- Investment ApproachCOOP-EST will provide the financing either directly to local financial institutions or through regional bank intermediaries (such as Bank BISE and its subsidiary TISE in Poland) that serve such local financial institutions. The risk retained by COOP-EST will be that of local financial institutions and regional bank intermediaries. Poland and Slovakia are expected to be among the first countries targeted by the fund. The overall geographic balance of the funds investment will depend largely on the existence of a sufficiently stable legal framework, as well as the existence of reliable and readily operational partners. Proposed exposure guidelines include a 15% single client exposure limit and a 15% single country exposure limit (with the exception of Poland).  In addition, the proceeds of the facility are subject to limitations in terms of the type of beneficiary institution (bank or non-bank) and type of investment (equity or debt). - Fund Management COOP-EST will be managed by a steering management group which initially will be staffed by three key members.

ParaLife,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Latin America Region,Paralife Holdings Ltd.,Regional Industry - FIG LAC,2006-08-17T04:00:00Z,2006-10-15T04:00:00Z,C,Equity,"The project involves the creation of a greenfield life insurance/reinsurance company called ParaLife (the project or the company), targeted at the disabled and sub-middle class populations in a number of countries in Latin America, starting with an initial launch in Mexico.  

Under the current proposal, the project aims to provide life insurance to disabled people and the individuals who provide their means of support (i.e., family members and/or sources of financial support) in the form of a simple 5 year single premium term insurance product with a savings option.  Following the findings of the feasibility study, the project design was expanded to also include an additional product providing term life cover purely to the non-disabled members of the family, and more generally to the sub middle class segment of the population through a distribution network involving disabled associations and communities, insurance distributors operating in the low income sector, micro-finance organizations and commercial banks (currently, through HSBC in Mexico).  The primary focus, however, remains on the disabled community, both on the insured side as well as developing the same disabled community for distributing the products.

The project focuses on a presently underserved and untapped market: people with disabilities, their family members and other people in the low income and poor sectors of the population. The disabled sector is not generally served in developing markets. The market study concluded that 50% of the disabled population would qualify for the life insurance products that Paralife is proposing, both in terms of their ages and types of disability. Including members of their families, the maximum total client potential for the Company could be up to 20% of a country's total population, and up to 30% of total country population including the low-income segments.  These markets have been largely ignored by the life insurance and savings industries and, in the target countries under review, no products similar to Paralife's are presently available on the market.  Traditional insurance companies have not entered the micro-insurance field because of the perceived lack of purchasing power of the low-income segments and the cost of conventional distribution   

Another important element of the project design involves the use of Foundations (Paralife Foundations), intended to provide funds for the educational programs for people with disabilities to prepare them for employment and entrepreneurship, as well as to train them to distribute the Paralife products. These Foundations are also designed to provide subsidies for the financing of the insurance premiums to the segment of the disabled population who do not have the necessary financial means.  The Mexican Government has already agreed to participate financially in the implementation of the Foundations, through cost-sharing of the training component.  Paralife Holdings intends to contribute 10% of its net profits to the Foundations, and seek additional funding from philanthropist and other charitable organizations, such as the Gates Foundation. 

Paralife intends to commence operations in Mexico by year-end 2006, followed by Venezuela and Colombia within 12 months hence.  If the project concept is successful and the markets are viable, Paralife intends to replicate the business model regionally in Latin America, and is considering further expansion in parts of Asia and Africa over the longer term.","","","","","","This project will have a very high development impact by creating a new type of institution that does not currently exist in most developing countries. Paralife will bring life insurance and associated good return' savings products to the poor and disabled communities that have previously been ignored by the main stream insurance industry.  Paralife, through working with the disabled and local communities, will also provide training and employment opportunities for the disabled through participation in the sales and distribution of the products.","","","","",This is an environmental and social category C project. No further environmental or social analysis is required.,"The project sponsors are Mr. Rolf Huppi, former Chairman and CEO of Zurich Financial Services, and Mr.  Gabriel Monterrubio, owner of Grupo SEP.

He will be retained as the Senior Advisor to the Chairman.","The total project cost is estimated at $ 21 million.

This is particularly important in countries such as Venezuela where oil accounts for about 25% of GDP, 80% of exports and 50% of fiscal revenues.- Promotion of local value-added to primary products by supporting secondary processing facilities:  about two-thirds of Metor''s production will be exported, while the balance will be further processed by local downstream customers in making fuel additives to improve vehicle emissions, and for general industrial purposes.- Create employment opportunities and community impact:  the company employs about 160 people.  Given the economies of scale in petrochemical operations, the expansion project will only require about 40-50 additional permanent workers; however there is a multiplier effect and industry sources estimate there are about 6 indirect jobs created for every one direct.  Up to 2,300 jobs will be supported during the construction phase of the project, about 90% of which will be local.  Eight of the nine-member management teams are locally recruited.  The company contributes about $300,000/year through its Social Responsibility Program, which focuses on housing, health and education for employees and the local community. - Improve environmental and safety standards:  the project will adopt strict environmental, social and safety standards which, in turn, will provide a demonstration effect to other similar projects in Venezuela.- Taxes and export earnings:  the project is estimated to pay an incremental $900 million in taxes over the life of the proposed IFC loan.  Although Venezuela generates major foreign exchange receipts from its oil exports, it is nonetheless worth noting the company is forecast to generate about $2.1 billion in exports over the life of the proposed IFC loan.","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFC''s Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

TTL is the third largest player in the global tea market with a consolidated turnover of $700 million and a presence in over 40 countries. TTLs operations span the entire value-chain in the tea business including tea cultivation, production, distribution and marketing of branded teas. TTLs strategy is to become a global beverage Company with a focus on branded tea operations. The ownership and management of tea plantations do not fit into this overall strategy.  Despite keen interest from investors to buy its plantations outright, TTL is pursuing an employee-owned business model to improve the efficiency and ensure the long-term sustainability of plantation operations.  Towards this end, TTL has started to separate its tea plantations in South and North East India as stand-alone companies.  In April 2005, TTL de-merged 17 tea plantations in South India into a separate Company  Kanan Devan Hills Plantations Company Private Limited (KDHP), with a majority shareholding being transferred to KDHPs 13,000 employees.  TTL continues to own 19% of KDHP and plays a key role on the board, in providing healthcare services through another Tata Group subsidiary and in providing continuous assistance to KDHP in other areas.  TTL now plans to de-merge its tea plantations in North East India into a new Company, NEPC. TTLs existing North India Plantation Operations (NIPO) comprise 24 tea plantations located in the states of Assam and West Bengal, encompassing a total area of approximately 24,000 hectares (ha). The business model is centered on deriving greater land and labor productivity through more efficient cultivation, improved capacity utilization of processing operations, alternative crop cultivation and exploiting the tourism potential in the locations.

For instance, Aier has nearly eliminated the practice of making informal payments to doctorsubiquitous in Chinaby greatly rewarding those doctors who declare such payments and fining those who accept them.

As a result of its long history and very conservative business culture, BBMs operations are characterized by robust credit structuring skills, as well as state-of-the-art risk management systems.In June 2006, IFC committed and disbursed to Banco BBM the local currency-equivalent of US$50 million, in order to support expansion of the Banks credit activities involving mid-sized corporate borrowers (the Original Credit or BBM I).  This was the first, major, long-tenor credit transaction undertaken by IFC aimed at supporting the operations of a medium-size Brazilian bank.  It was also the first, significant, local currency-indexed debt financing executed by IFC in Brazil.With an increase of nearly 100% from June 2005 to June 2006, the expansion of BBMs credit portfolio has exceeded expectations.

Block Z-1,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Peru,BPZ RESOURCES INC,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2006-09-22T04:00:00Z,2006-10-31T05:00:00Z,B,Loan,"BPZ Energy, Inc. (BPZ) is developing an integrated gas-to-power project in northwest Peru, near the border with Ecuador.  The project is designed to produce gas from their current gas reserves offshore and generate electricity for the growing demand for electricity in northern Peru.  

The project involves: refurbishment of an existing platform located offshore in the Corvina field in Block Z-1 some 10 miles from shore; rehabilitation of an existing suspended well and initially the drilling of two new producing wells at the platform location; installation of a 10' diameter pipeline to transport gas from the platform to shore; construction and operation of a gas processing plant capable of processing 125 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD ) and a 160 MW single cycle gas power plant with initial gas supply requirements of 40 MMSCFD.

The platform upgrade program began in September 2005, with drilling starting in September 2006.  Construction of the pipeline, the onshore gas processing plant and power plant is scheduled to begin in early 2007 with first power generation anticipated in October 2007.

BPZ is planning in the future to supply gas from the Corvina field to third party power generators in south west Ecuador via a 40 mile pipeline to be constructed.  The expansion for supplying Ecuador will also include drilling two additional producing wells.","","","","","","- Monetization of Natural Gas & Creation of Gas Markets:

This project will support the monetization of hydrocarbons, particularly stranded natural gas reserves, in Peru.  It will not only explore, develop and produce natural gas, but will also create regional markets for natural gas.  Peru and Ecuador are two countries that are both desperate to increase their gas and electricity supplies.  BPZ's project will directly increase electricity supplies in Peru through the construction of the Caleta Cruz power plant, and will potentially increase electricity supplies in Ecuador by selling natural gas to power producers in Arenillas.

- Contribution to Peruvian Government Revenue:

The project facilitates the production and sale of gas and, possibly, liquids, which provide an important source of revenue to the country through royalties and taxes.

- Creating Local Employment and Sourcing in Peru:

The project will create direct new employment opportunities in Peru associated with the exploration and development of Block Z-1, construction and maintenance of the Caleta Cruz power plant and the potential construction of the pipeline to Ecuador.  The project will also have an impact on secondary employment through services provided by local contractors.

- Fuel Substitution and Transmission System Stability:

Since most thermal capacity in both Peru and Ecuador is diesel generated, IFC's support of the project will help to substitute the more expensive and more polluting imports of diesel and fuel oil for clean natural gas in both countries.  The project will reduce transmission constraints by reversing the flow of electricity from South to North.  The plant will also have an important role for providing stability to the system through its location at the end of a long line in the transmission network.  

- Community Development:

BPZ has designed a Social Development Plan (SDP) and will commit approximately $250,000 annually to support this effort. The main components the SDP plan is to cover are: educational and training programs for the communities in worker capacity development, micro enterprise development and health and nutrition; basic needs and infrastructure development projects; the generation of alliances and partnerships for the implementation of long-term development projects particularly relating to health and education; and meeting local philanthropic needs. Early implementation of some SDP programs has already begun to benefit the local communities (for more details, see the ESRS).

IFC plans to monitor the following development impacts: 

- employment; 
- local/national purchasing; 
- payments to regional governments; and 
- investments in community programs.","","The proposed IFC investment would be consistent with the standards recently adopted in the WBG's Management Response to the EIR.  BPZ is a small, regional player with significant interests in the development of primarily stranded gas reserves for the surrounding regional market.  

Governance Context: The benefits of this project come in a number of forms as outlined above, including revenues to the governments in the form of taxes and royalties.  In coming to a view of whether to support this project, IFC considered the value of the project's benefits, and governance and other risks to these benefits.  In this respect it has reviewed a range of assessments including, but not limited to, the World Bank Institute's Governance Indicators and Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index.  Also taken into account is Peru's current engagement with the World Bank Group and the IMF.  At the national level, Peru has already achieved a relatively high standard on accountability and transparency in the collection and distribution of oil, gas and mining revenues. This effort is part of a broader process of fiscal decentralization; it builds upon existing legislation regarding access to information and is consistent with Peru's commitment to the G8 Transparency Compact.  The Government, through the Minister of Energy and Mines, has subscribed to the EITI and appointed an EITI coordinator.  BPZ has also agreed to make all payments made to the government public.

BPZ is a publicly listed U.S. company and is subject to robust operational and financial disclosure requirements.  BPZ's board includes three independent directors who also serve as chairs of the company's Audit Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and Compensation Committee.","","","The gas to power project in northwest Peru is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to the applicable performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

The strategy for promoting private-sector led growth is further elaborated in the World Bank Groups Private Sector Development Strategy, appended to the CAS, which proposes that the World Bank and IFC work closely together to: - facilitate greater competitiveness;- improve the quantity and quality of infrastructure through greater private participation;- promote the provision of private health services; and- improve rural productivity and growth through greater private investment. IFC will focus on providing firms with long-term debt and equity which may not be available from domestic financial markets; and on adding value in the areas of global best practices, creating international partnerships, entering new markets, environmental and social sustainability and corporate governance. The proposed IFC investment is therefore consistent with the WBGs strategic priorities in India.- Development Impact:Since the mid-1990s, India has implemented policy changes to encourage private investment in its upstream oil and gas sector. Although success remains modest, a number of foreign companies, such as Cairn, have successfully entered the sector. IFC''s proposed investment reflects its continuing commitment to enhance the role of the private sector in the upstream hydrocarbons sector in India. The proposed transaction, similar to the senior loan investment made by IFC earlier this year, is expected to have the following key development impacts:Enhancing Availability of Higher-Quality, Domestic Fuel: The project is expected to reduce the reliance of India''s power sector and small industry on supplies on relatively inferior coal and more expensive naphtha, respectively. - Import Substitution: At its currently projected peak plateau production rate of 150,000 bbl/d, the Rajasthan development would account for a significant portion of Indias indigenous oil production and help reduce its oil imports.- Creation and Preservation of Direct and Indirect Employment: In 2005 approximately 75% of Cairn Energy PLCs staff and contractors were local nationals. The Rajasthan development is expected to generate 450-500 jobs during peak operations (approximately 2,500 during the construction period), benefiting the local community through increased employment opportunities both directly and indirectly. - Supporting Local Communities:  Cairn supports a wide range of community development activities in all its operations.  Its work is concentrated in five main areas  health, education, local entrepreneurship development, environment and infrastructure  and benefits from effective co-ordination with local government, NGOs and media. Significant emphasis going forward is to be placed on meeting local community expectations for value-added employment opportunities, as well as further improvements of water infrastructure, medical services, health education, etc.- Benefits to Government:It is expected that the government of India will receive substantial fiscal receipts from royalties, production sharing and corporate taxes, generated by the incremental production to be achieved as a result of the proposed investment. Specifically in the case of Rajasthan, a sizeable proportion of fiscal payments will accrue directly to the state government in the form of royalties.The key development indicators that are proposed to be monitored during the life of the IFC investment are: - annual production of oil and gas in India, - direct employment levels, - production sharing and fiscal payments accruing to the governments of India, and - implementation of community development programs.","","An important benefit of the investments supported by the proposed financing is revenue flows to governments in the form of taxes, royalties and other payments, especially in the case of prospective oil projects in India. The World Bank has very active programs in India which is one of its largest borrowers and is generally seen, based on available indicators such as Transparency Internationals Corruption Perceptions Index and the World Bank Institutes Governance Indicators, as having adequate governance capacity.  Accountability for collection and use of revenues at the national level is not seen as a significant risk. The company has agreed to disclose publicly its payments to governments (including production sharing) at the state and national level.  On balance, given the governance context, the expected development impact and the projected benefits, including to communities and local government, IFC believes that this is a project which it should support.","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

Kenya Schools,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Africa,Kenya,Kenya School Financing Facility,Regional Industry - MAS Africa,2006-09-27T04:00:00Z,2006-10-27T04:00:00Z,FI,Guarantee,"The proposed project is an initiative to provide local currency financing and technical assistance to private educational institutions in Kenya. It is the second such initiative in the education sector after IFCs pilot school financing facility in Ghana, committed in June 2005. IFC would provide risk-sharing of up to 120 million Kenya Shillings ($1.7 million equivalent) to K-Rep Bank (K-Rep or the Bank) on loans extended to eligible private schools in Kenya. These loans will be used to finance construction, purchase of educational materials, and other capital expenditures.  In parallel with the financing facility, a comprehensive technical assistance program is under preparation.  The program will be designed to: - strengthen schools financial, management, and educational capacities; - improve the business environment for private education; and - foster the development of an independent provider of educational services to private schools.  Technical assistance will also be provided to the Bank to build its capacity to conduct due diligence of educational institutions and monitor its education portfolioCurrently, few local banks are lending to private primary and secondary schools, and those that do, generally lend for less than two years. Thus, even if schools are able to secure bank financing, the tenor of that financing is generally not long enough to support expansion or modernization projects. Such projects thus proceed in a piecemeal fashion, resulting in a great deal of inefficiency and lost potential revenue. Further, expansion by such means cannot keep pace with the huge growth in demand for private schooling. IFCs risk-sharing would be structured to encourage the Bank to extend maturities to 3-5 years, tenors more appropriate for financing capital investments. Despite the impressive growth of private schools in Kenya over the past 15 years, most remain fundamentally weak in their financial and managerial capacities, as well as in their ability to develop more effective educational delivery mechanisms. The majority of schools has minimal financial expertise, weak information systems, if any, and limited opportunities for teacher training and curriculum development. The technical assistance program designed in conjunction with the financing facility is intended to address many of these shortcomings for participating schools, and, in addition, to strengthen the environment for private school operators.","","","","","","The proposed project will have a substantial impact on both the education and financial sectors in Kenya. First, it will help improve the educational quality and financial and managerial capacity of private primary and secondary schools in Kenya. In doing so, the project will enable schools to obtain financing from the formal banking sector and widen access to much-needed quality education. The enormous demand for private schools is currently unmet, in large part because schools have little access to affordable, long- or medium-term financing, and little training in financial management. This project will address both shortcomings, and, with respect to the latter, demonstrate sound practices throughout the sector. Second, the projects technical assistance component will also help schools strengthen their educational management capacities, thus setting a standard for the private sector, and improving the business environment for private education. Third, the project will introduce to the financial sector a means of delivering medium-term local currency financing to educational and other institutions. Finally, this project would further demonstrate the applicability of this risk-sharing model for reaching small education providerswhich comprise the vast majority of private providersthroughout Africa (and other regions). IFC could thus continue to expand education financing to other African countries with similar markets and constraints.","","","","",This is a Category FI Type 1 project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.

Leadway was founded in 1970 by the late Sir Hassan O. Odukale and commenced operations in 1971.  The company provides a full range of both life and non-life insurance products and allied financial services through a network of sixteen branches and key broker relationships spread across Nigeria.

The proposed IFC investment in Leadway will help support the development a leading local insurer, promote the overall market for private insurance in Nigeria, and will in turn help reduce the amount of capital leaving the country for the accounts of non-Nigerian insurers.Insurance companies have a disproportionately high impact on developing economies because they are necessarily large investors who directly affect the general economy through their operations.  In order to settle claims that may arise, insurers invest excess premium income to build a portfolio of financial assets and income-producing real estate which can then be called upon to pay off any future claims that arise.

Rabitabank had equity of $9 mln and total assets of $43 mln as of the end-June 2006.   Rabitabank was established in 1993 by public sector companies controlled by the Ministry of Communications in order to provide new banking services to communications sector companies. Since then the Bank was privatized and currently 97% privately owned.  Since its formation, Rabitabank managed to expand to 12 branches throughout Azerbaijan, diversify its client base beyond what originally used to be a mainly communications sector niche.  Today the Bank provides a full range of banking services, including corporate banking, retail banking and trade finance.  However, the primary focus of the Bank from the outset has always been MSMEs and the Bank has identified the MSME sector as their primary target market in their long-term strategy.  

The Bank became IFC's client in 1998 after receiving the first $400 thousand credit line fully repaid by now.  Subsequently Rabitabank received the second $1.2 million credit line in 2003 with currently outstanding amount of $900 thousand. The previous loans and technical assistance provided as an integral part of the investments helped the Bank to grow its balance sheet and become a profitable medium-sized bank focused on the MSME sector. 

In order to grow further, the Bank approached IFC with a request to provide a new loan in order to expand further its lending to MSMEs.  

IFC is considering a new credit line Loan to Rabitabank up to $2 million with a convertible option.  The long term funding would allow the Bank to strengthen its balance sheet in view of the expected expansion and increased demand for funding from MSMEs, entrepreneurs and individuals.  The investment will be accompanied by targeted technical assistance to contribute to the institutional capacity building of the Bank and improve such areas as Risk Management, Strategic Planning, and MIS.","","","","","","The World Bank Group strategy in Azerbaijan is to support diversified economic growth and maintain macroeconomic stability, as a necessary condition for reducing poverty.  In recent years, Azerbaijan has achieved strong economic growth largely as a result of oil sector development and high international oil prices.  The World Bank Group strategy is focused on achieving balanced development in the non-oil sector across Azerbaijan's regions.  Sustainable economic development can be achieved if driven by a dynamic private enterprise sector outside the oil sector and stronger financial sector intermediaries, supported by a more streamlined efficient and transparent public sector.  Within this context, IFC's strategy in Azerbaijan is focused on broadening financing opportunities for MSMEs linked with as well as outside the oil and gas sector and financial sector development.

This project is highly complementary to the World Bank Group country strategy. The project will enable IFC to play a tangible role in promoting MSME development in Azerbaijan by supporting an MSME focused medium-sized local bank willing to improve it risk management practices, structures and procedures.","","","","","As an existing client, this project has been categorized as Category FI Type 1 project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.

Lonmin wishes IFC to assist it with international perspective and expertise in four technical assistance areas, namely business linkages, HIV/AIDS management, integrating women into the workforce and tribal/municipal revenue management. The IFC PEP Africa (Private Enterprise Partnership) - Technical Assistance teams, which are divided up according to the four components listed above, have completed a scoping exercise involving Lonmin, the local municipality, the principal traditional authority and other key stakeholders. It is intended that this TA package will be complemented by a loan investment on IFCs own account and an equity investment. The loan investment will be used for expansion within the existing footprint through the part funding of projects including the mechanization of mining operations, increased mining throughput and processing expansion. The IFC commercial investment will, in part fund the upgrading or improvements to the existing infrastructure such as mechanization of underground operations and smelter upgrades both of which will have a positive impact on working conditions and safety and will thus not cause any major direct new impacts on the communities. Any new developments such as large new infrastructure would be subject to the requirement for an ESIA under both South African legislation and IFC Policy & Performance Standards.","","","","The appraisal team reviewed the South African platinum operations of Lonmin plc. Key focus was a review of Lonmins Safety, Health, Environment, Community and Security (SHECS) management, organization and systems. This includes the Lonmin Environmental Management System (EMS), information and other documents related to management of environmental, social and labor issues. Environmental Management Program Reports (EMPRs) for each South African operation, Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) prepared for certain new developments within these operations, closure plans, key monitoring data, the New Era Labor Agreement (NELA) were all reviewed. Discussions were held with Lonmin management (UK and RSA-based) and particularly with the SHECS Department, representatives of the Madibeng Local Municipality, the Bapo Ba Mogale Traditional Authority, Landmark (consultancy focused on transformation of the company and stakeholder relations), ward councillors, traditional councillors, local health workers, local school teachers and members of the Lonmin Development Trust. Site visits involved a cross-section of Lonmins facilities and operational areas, including: mechanized and non-mechanized shafts (underground) at Karee and Western Platinum Limited (WPL); Baobab Shaft at Limpopo Division (underground); tailings dams at WPL; WPL smelter and base metal refinery; WPL and Limpopo concentrators; Precious Metal Refinery (PMR Brakpan, near Johannesburg); several Lonmin Development Trust project sites (schools, clinics, agricultural operation), Madibeng Local Municipality (Brits), Bapo Ba Mogale Traditional Authority Headquarters (Bapong), Wonderkop Hostel and community. Several other communities within the Greater Lonmin Community were visited.","","","","","","","","","","","","The main driver for IFC involvement is a TA package with a supporting commercial investment in the form of corporate financing.

The project consists of: - the development, expansion, and mechanization of Lonmins South African mines; and- the development of a comprehensive, large-scale community and local economic development program (LEDP).   The financing will consist of a standby 10 year A loan of $100 million and an equity investment of $15-50 million.","","","","","","-  The Mining Industry in South AfricaIn 2005 the mining industry generated 7% of South Africas GDP. The importance of the industry to overall GDP has decreased slightly over the last 3 years, largely due to the growth in the secondary and tertiary sectors and contraction in the gold-mining industry. However, if the gross value-added contribution of processed minerals (presently included in the manufacturing sectors figures) were added to mining, along the extensive economic linkages with other sectors, the impact on national accounts would be significantly higher.During 2004, the mining industry employed 2.9% of South Africas economically active population. As the majority of South Africas mining operations are based in the rural areas of the country, the mining industry has spawned an extensive and efficient physical infrastructure and has contributed greatly to the establishment of secondary industries.  Recent legislation has tried to deepen the positive impacts of the mining industry on local communities and the national economy.The South African Mineral Resource and Petroleum Bill was legislated in 2004 with the following objectives: - to transfer custody of mineral rights from private holders to the Government; - to implement mining license reforms; and- to develop social empowerment through changes in ownership of mining companies; and other measures.As in other sectors, the legislation was aimed primarily at increasing participation of previously disadvantaged groups in the mining industry, both as shareholders and suppliers. This led to the creation of Black Economic Empowerment entities (BEEs), which are majority owned and managed by historically disadvantaged South Africans (HDSAs). The key element of this new charter was the requirement (beginning in 2004) for mining companies to sell 15% over 5 years to be further increased to 26% over 10 years to BEEs. In order to receive new order mining rights which reflect the companys compliance with the new legislation, all mining companies are expected to have met the 15% ownership requirement and completed a detailed Social and Labour Plan (among other requirements) by 2009.  Lonmins BEE partner is Incwala, which holds an 18% share in Lonmins two main South African subsidiaries. Lonmin, in turn, holds a 23% stake in Incwala.  Lonmin is on track to achieve the 26% BEE ownership goal by 2014. Lonmin was recently notified of the successful conversion of their old order mining rights to new order mining rights for its Marikana operations.  Lonmin is the first major platinum company in South Africa to receive the new order mining licenses.  The Company will work with the Department of Mines and Energy to set a timetable for the fulfillment of the undertakings in the Social and Labour Plan portion of their conversion application.  Meeting these objectives will ensure that they are in compliance with the South Africa Mining Charter.  The project is expected to have the following development impacts through its positive impact on the sector in South Africa:- Expansion of an internationally competitive mining operation:Lonmins activities generate significant benefits to South Africa in terms of employment, linkages with suppliers and taxes and revenues paid to national government and royalties paid to local communities. In the latest fiscal year, for example, the company employed 25,000 people in South Africa, paid $313m in salaries and benefits, paid $80m to government and spent $361m for materials and services, with 37% of total procurement spend going to HDSA suppliers.  Additionally, Lonmin pays royalties to the Bapo Ba Mogale tribe in the Marikana area as well as Traditional Authorities in Limpopo.  The major part of its output of over 900,000 oz platinum was exported. It is expected that all of these benefits will increase as a result of the expansion program.  In addition, the government will receive indirectly payroll tax payments made by employees of Lonmin. Lonmin will disclose all material tax and royalty payments in its annual report and accounts as required by statutory reporting authorities.- An Extensive Community and Local Economic Development Program:A major component of Lonmins future plans is its community development activities. Lonmin currently has a robust community development framework in place comprising a newly invigorated development trust and a social and community based function within their corporate structure. Community development is a core component of Lonmins charter and corporate strategy.  Lonmin hopes to grow these programs beyond their current capacity and will supplement their in-house expertise with IFCs expertise in design and implementation.  This project component is expected to have measurable positive impacts in the areas of HIV/AIDs prevention, Municipal Development, Gender equality and Local Economic Development (See also discussion of IFC Contribution). - Skills Development: Lonmins skills development and worker training is an integral part of its planned expansion program and Local Economic Development Program (LEDP) that will encourage and facilitate the greater engagement of local businesses and will address the skills shortage in South Africas labour force through increased functional and leadership training.  The expansion project will result in enhanced mechanical and other skills and capability. The LEDP will impart business skills and education to the greater community and facilitate greater small and medium size business commercial engagement with Lonmin and others.The key development indicators that are proposed to be monitored during the life of the IFC investment are: - annual production of PGM ounces;- Lonmins financial performance;- successful implementation of community development programs  based on objective measures of success (that will be developed with the company); and - fiscal payments accruing to the both the Federal and Municipal governments.","","- Governance Context South Africas first multi-racial democratic elections were held in 1994, shortly after the collapse of apartheid. Since that time, South Africa has worked to build a robust democratic government focused on transparency and inclusion.  It has a strong civil society.  It is perceived as one of the most transparent and progressive African countries and is ranked second among African countries on Transparency Internationals Corruption Perception Index (CPI).  South Africa has experienced an impressive acceleration of economic growth recently. Strong macroeconomic policy fundamentals supported by favorable export prices have underpinned good macro performance. A conservative fiscal policy and a credible, mature inflation targeting framework resulted in low inflation and interest rates, fueling domestic demand. South African growth accelerated in 2005 to 4.9%, its highest growth in 21 years, from 4.5% a year earlier, and about 3% in the 1990s.South Africa continues to face major social challenges of unemployment, poverty, and problems with service delivery at the local level. Key challenges are: - reducing unemployment and expanding opportunities for SMEs; - fighting HIV/AIDS; - improving the effectiveness of social transfers; - closing the skills gap;- strengthening capacity for service delivery at the local level; - accelerating land reform; and - monitoring and evaluation.On balance given the variety of development benefits expected to be delivered by the project and South Africas governance  context,  as evidenced by its recent record as well as a by a variety of strong governance indicators such as those of the World Bank Institute, IFC believes that this is a project it should support.","","","The main driver for IFC involvement is an integrated TA package and supporting commercial investment in the form of corporate financing.

This is a Category B project according to IFC's Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or criteria.  The IFC made this categorization based on:

-  Site visit to the proposed project areas in Turkey and Romania;
-  Meetings with Environmental and Social staff from the Borrower;
-  Meetings with communities impacted by the project and local authorities; and
-  Review of environmental and social documentation.

The Turkey offshore facility is located approximately 10 km from shore and has seven producing wells with three platforms.  Based on information from the ecological studies performed on the marine environment, the location of the rig and wells is not in a sensitive environment, precautions have also been taken to monitor fishermen, disposal of liquid and solid waste. The gas will be transported in the future via a buried pipeline to a processing facility in the town of Akcakoca, Turkey.  An Environmental Impact Assessment has been approved by the regional environmental authorities, and the processing facility is currently under construction.  Another component of the project is an offshore pipeline of approximately 18 km to connect with the national pipeline operated by the Turkish national gas utility.  The pipeline was constructed by Toreador but will be transferred to BOTAS for operations.  The right-of-way (ROW) compensation was done in a willing buyer-willing seller basis.

No individual or family has been resettled or rendered economically unviable through the process of land acquisition in either Turkey or Romania. Though the national petroleum law in both countries grants oil and gas companies the right to exercise the faculty of eminent domain, Toreador has expressed unwillingness to avail itself of that right because it is too risky for their reputation.

The Romania fields were acquired in a bid process from the state owned entity.  The company has constructed a gas processing facility and is currently producing from 6 wells and is continuing with well work over.   

Through this assessment the IFC has been able to measure the magnitude of the potential impacts and it is considered that the environmental and social impacts from the project are not significant.","","","","",25485,"",AB - Oil and Gas Production (Includes Development),"","","",""

Having identified a series of specific investment projects in this region, notably in Turkey (offshore gas in the Black Sea) and Romania (onshore oil and gas), the company is now seeking long-term external financing in order to accelerate their development.  These projects are expected to position Toreador as a key player and foreign investor in Turkey and Romanias domestic oil and gas sectors, and will produce a shift in Toreadors production focus from oil to natural gas.IFC has been asked to provide a corporate credit facility of up to $50 million for its own account to Toreador to help finance a portion of its 2007-2008 capital expenditure program, estimated at $150 million, in Turkey and Romania.","","","","","","Enhancing Availability of More Efficient and Cleaner Fuel:  The project will support the development of and exploration for primarily natural gas reserves in Turkey and Romania.  The increased availability of natural gas in both countries is expected to promote the use of a cleaner and more efficient fuel.Increased Supply of Domestic Sources of Energy:The project will increase Turkey and Romanias supply of domestic sources of energy.  Moreover, with the Companys secondary recovery activities in Romania, the project will improve resource utilization of smaller mature fields which have no interest for the larger players.Benefits to the Governments:  It is expected that the governments of Turkey and Romania will receive fiscal receipts from royalties, production sharing and/or corporate taxes, generated by the production to be achieved by the proposed investment.Promoting Competition and Attracting Foreign Direct Investment in the Upstream Sector:  The project promotes competition in the oil & gas sector through the growth of a small independent player, particularly in Turkey, where the sector is dominated by the state-owned enterprises.  The participation of smaller companies is important to the oil and gas sector, as they can develop reserves too small to be of interest to larger independents and the majors, and thus help improve production and recovery rates. If successful, the project would demonstrate the viability of investment by small independents in the upstream sectors in Turkey and Romania.  Creation and Preservation of Direct and Indirect Employment: In 2005, Toreador employed directly 43 nationals in Turkey and Romania and provided indirect employment for another 14 national consultants. The development of the fields will generate a significant number of new jobs especially during the construction period, benefiting the local community through increased employment opportunities both directly and indirectly.The key development indicators that are proposed to be monitored during the life of the IFC investment are as follows: -  fiscal payments accruing to the governments of Turkey and Romania; -  value of contracts with local suppliers; and -  direct employment levels.","","The benefits of this project come in a number of forms as outlined above, including revenues to the governments of Turkey and Romania in the form of corporate taxes (33% in Turkey and 16% in Romania) and royalties (12.5% of production in Turkey and 7.5% in Romania). In coming to a view of whether to support this project, IFC considered the value of the projects benefits, and governance and other risks to these benefits. It considered a range of governance assessment methodologies, including but not limited to Transparency Internationals Corruption Perceptions Index and the World Bank Institutes Governance Indicators, as well as the current relationship between the host countries and the World Bank Group.

Following the amendment of the Insurance Act in December 2005 to enforce a segregation of operation between life insurance and non-life insurance underwriting, Madison Insurance Company Limited was split into two business entities namely: Madison General Insurance Company (Zambia) Limited and Madison Life Insurance Company (Zambia) Limited.  The Group has also expanded to include Madison Investment Company Limited and Madison Health Solutions Limited. The project consists of an equity investment of up to $2 million for a shareholding of up to 15% (IFC Equity Investment) and a senior loan of up to $3 million (IFC Loan) to the Group.  Madison Group is the leading insurance group in Zambia.  The projects main objective is to strengthen and expand the operational capacity of Madison Group in Zambia.  The proposed investment allows IFC to:- support  mid-tier local insurance groups in the African region both through financial and non-financial assistance;- support the Group with its strategy of expanding its activities into property development and mortgage financing through its subsidiary Madison Investment Company Limited.","","","","","","The potential developmental, institutional and capacity building impact of the project is high.  The capitalization proposed for Madison will help reinforce the local insurance industry in Zambia and help the company better compete with foreign based insurers in the local and regional markets. This will in turn reduce the amount of capital leaving the country for the accounts of non-Zambian insurers.IFC''s investment will help in the transformation of an existing local institution into a strong and viable private sector entity that will attract other foreign players into the Zambian insurance industry.  The investment will have an important demonstration effect in that it will result in an increase in the overall market size of private insurance in the country. Insurance companies have a disproportionately high impact on economies because they are necessarily large investors who directly affect the general economy through their operations.  In order to settle claims that may arise, insurers invest excess premium income to build a portfolio of financial assets and income-producing real estate which can then be called upon to pay off any future claims that arise.  A vibrant insurance industry can be a reliable source of long-term capital, which is lacking in Zambia as well as in many African countries.  The provision of quality insurance is therefore crucial for the development of a healthy and dynamic private sector and long-term capital markets.","","","","",This is a category C project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedure.

The nature of the companys operations is such that it will be possible to readily design and implement engineering and management measures to mitigate any adverse impacts that result from the project. Moreover, in light of the fact that mitigation measures can readily be designed, adverse impacts are not expected to be diverse or irreversible and will be limited to project site, and no physical or economic displacement of communities occurred, the project has been classified as a Category B.","","","","",25017,"","BA - Electrical Machinery, Equipment and Components (Electric Lighting, Motors, Batteries, Insulated Wires and Cables, Fiber Optic Cable, Carbon and Graphite Products, etc.)","","","",""

These investments would take the form of small loans made on commercial terms to existing clients for the purpose of financing CP investments (CP Loans).  CP is the continuous improvement of industrial processes, services and products to enhance the conversion efficiency of manufacturing inputs (such as energy, water, raw materials) to saleable outputs.  This process reduces resource consumption and hence reduces waste streams and environmental impact at source.  Well-designed CP interventions are highly profitable.  CP initiatives can reduce or eliminate the need for costly end-of-pipe environmental protection projects, and in contrast to end-of-pipe interventions, CP reduces rather than increases manufacturing cost by reducing input costs and the costs of pollution mitigation.  Despite these obvious attractions, many CP improvement opportunities are not implemented by industry.  Previous work by IFC and others suggests that impediments to CP implementation include a combination of lack of awareness of financial benefits available from CP, lack of technical ability to identify CP opportunities and develop these into bankable projects and perception of risk and lack of access to finance.  IFC's Environmental and Social Department is already discussing the provision of donor support for CP with the following donors: - Austria,- Bavaria,- Denmark,- Italy, - Japan, and-  Norway.By teaming up donor assistance with access to IFC finance, it is hoped that upfront barriers to CP will be overcome and adoption of CP will be accelerated.","","","","","","The CPLP will focus on financially viable projects which improve the conversion efficiency of raw material and energy inputs.  The sub-projects under the CPLP are expected to be economically attractive as resource savings outweigh the capital and operating costs of implementation.  Environmental performance is also expected to improve in most of the sub-projects.  At the enterprise level, CP projects may help maintain access to export markets, enhance reputation through 'green branding', and better manage scarce local resources to allow future expansion of activities.  Successful projects and companies are hoped to create a demonstration effect.

It is expected that the organic silicon project will employ 225 people on permanent basis.  Also, Dongyue Chemicals will hire around 50 new staff to work in its expanded R134a plant and in its under-development CDM plant.  In addition, significant local employment will also be generated on temporary basis during the construction period of the greenfield and expansion plants.  Moreover, the Corporate Restructuring will significantly accelerate the growth of Dongyue Group, thus generating additional employment opportunities in various functions and various parts of the group.The proposed project will contribute to the development of the local economy.  First, Dongyue Group plans to rely exclusively on Chinese contractors and construction workers for the implementation of its Capital Expenditure Program.  Second, Dongyue Groups main raw material for its existing operations is fluorite, which is sourced from mines located within China.  The increased demand on fluorite will stimulate investments in fluorite mines, some of which are located in the less developed Chinese provinces (e.g. Inner Mongolia).  Similarly, the groups proposed organic silicon plant will utilize silicon powder and methanol as the main raw materials, both of which are also sourced from Chinese producers.  And being primarily an export-substitution project, the company expects to sell its entire production of organic silicon domestically, and in many cases in the form of intermediate products for further processing by other Chinese manufacturers, thus generating significant local investment opportunities. The key development indicators that are proposed to be monitored during the life of the IFC investment are: - direct employment levels, - volume of silicon monomers further processed within China into final products, and - value of construction contracts awarded to local firms.","","","","","IFC''s early review of this investment has identified the following environmental, social, health and safety issues: air emission, wastewater treatment and discharge, solid and hazardous waste management, operation hazard and hazardous material management, employee health and safety, fire protection and emergency response, community health/safety, community relationship and development, and land acquisition process.

IPR EGYPT,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Middle East and North Africa,"Egypt, Arab Republic of",IPR TRANSOIL CORPORATION,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2006-11-29T05:00:00Z,2006-12-29T05:00:00Z,B,Loan,"The IPR Group of Companies (IPR or the company) is a group of privately-held domestic and international companies that engages in exploration and production of oil primarily in Egypt, but also in Syria and Pakistan.  IPR is headquartered in Dallas, Texas, where, besides being active in exploration and production through its affiliates in Egypt, Pakistan and Syria, it also provides petroleum consulting services through out the world.  IPRs existing production is largely concentrated in its Alamein Yidma concession in the Western Desert area of Egypt, but it also has existing production in the Gulf of Suez from the North July concession.IFC has been asked to provide financing of up to $25 million to help fund a portion of IPRs capital expenditure program for the 2006-2009 period.  The program (drilling nine new wells and undertaking 51 well interventions or workovers, plus auxiliary facilities) will focus primarily on the further appraisal and development of its Almein Yidma field, but will also target exploration and development of five other oil fields in Egypt, namely, North Bahariya, North Ras Qattara and El Diyur all located in the Western Desert, and the Southwest Gebel El Zeit and North July fields offshore in the Gulf of Suez.","","","","","","Fit with World Bank Group Strategy:Current World Bank Group (WBG) priorities in Egypt, as outlined in the FY06-09 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) are:- facilitating private sector development; - enhancing the provision of public services; and - promoting social and economic equity. More specifically, IFC''s strategy for Egypt focuses on: - encouraging private investments in infrastructure, mining and hydrocarbon sector; - supporting export-oriented manufacturing; - technical assistance for SME development and the business enabling environment; and - supporting financial sector activities.  In recent years, crude oil production in Egypt has declined from 700,000 bpd in 2001/2 to an estimated 640,000 bpd in 2005/2006 due to lower production from maturing fields, while domestic demand has been rising. This has resulted in significant ongoing efforts to raise oil and gas production to meet domestic needs as well as to step up natural gas exports. The WBG is actively supporting these efforts; IFC has four existing oil and gas investments, and the World Bank is currently engaged in providing technical assistance to the Government of Egypt (GoE), on strengthening domestic natural gas distribution in the country. The proposed project fits well within the WBGs strategy for Egypt as it promotes the participation of the private sector and foreign direct investment in Egypts important hydrocarbons sector, especially in smaller fields that would otherwise be ignored by larger oil companies.Anticipated Development Impact of the Project:The hydrocarbon sector is important to the Egyptian economy, contributing nearly 10% of GDP and 53% of export earnings as well as drawing a significant share of foreign direct investment.  IFCs investment will continue to support foreign investment in Egypts hydrocarbon sector.  The country recently went from an oil exporter to an oil importer. Finally, IPR specializes in enhanced oil recovery and management of marginal and declining production fields.  This technology and expertise is being applied to extend the life of smaller fields that are of no interest to the larger oil companies. This technology is being shared with its partners, including the local oil company, Sahara Petroleum.  - Contributions to Government Revenue:Direct economic benefits for GoE in the form of Egyptian General Petroleum Corporations (EGPC) production share (includes IPRs share of royalties and income taxes).  - Creating and Providing Sustainable Local Employment:  IPR is an important source of local employment in the fields it operates, particularly in its largest field, Alamein Yidma, which, through the Joint Operating Company El Hamra Oil, employs 125 people, 90% of whom are Egyptian.  Overall, IPR employs approximately 250 people in Egypt, with the majority (90%) locals.  As the company has success in its exploration and development projects, it is likely that employment will grow. - Local Purchases of Goods and Services: Egypt has a thriving local oil services industry that will benefit from the project and will involve expenditures on local goods and services which will be tracked on an annual basis. Currently, IPR estimates that 70% of its annual purchases are spent locally. IFC will monitor the projects development impacts annually based on information provided by IPR in respect of: - annual contributions to government revenue, - local employment, and - purchases of local goods and services from local suppliers.","","As mentioned above, benefits from this project accrue from a variety of sources, including employment, supply linkages, and contributions to government revenues.  The projects revenue contributions to the GoE form an insignificant share - less than 0.01% - of total government revenues. The GoEs share of revenues partly accrues to the Ministry of Petroleum (MoP) and for income taxes to Ministry of Finance (MoF). The GoE manages these revenues through reinvestment in the sector, as well as through the provision of affordable petroleum products to the countrys population. The GoE is currently in the process of reforming its system of fuel subsidies, and has a target of reducing the fiscal deficit by 1 percent of GDP per year over the next few years.  In its assessment, IFC has considered the value of the projects benefits, and governance and other risks to these benefits. It has considered in this respect a range of indicators of governance, and the current relationship between Egypt and the World Bank and IMF. IFC believes the risks to project benefits not being realized, is relatively small. The non-revenue benefits which are significant, such as strengthening domestic energy production, technology transfer, generating jobs, purchases of local goods and services are unlikely to be impacted by weak governance. The project is also consistent with overall WBG objectives in the oil and gas sector; including helping strengthen private sector participation in the sector.To ensure transparency, IPR has agreed to publish their annual payments to EGPC.","","","This is a category B project because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines and the corrective action plan.IPR has prepared the framework for an Integrated Health, Safety, Environment and Social Management System and is currently in the process of developing the Management System Procedures.

The NewCo is planned to offer various housing finance products, targeting middle-income customer segment in Saudi Arabia, and grow to the nations largest specialized mortgage finance institution over years.","","","","","","The project is expected to have a high impact contribution on residential infrastructure development and financial sector development in KSA:Increased Access to Housing Finance: The NewCo will provide increased affordability of housing finance for middle-income Saudi households, currently underserved by developers, who tend to focus on the wealthiest segments of the population.  Access to housing is a major problem in KSA, with demand consistently outstripping supply and the housing deficit increasing each year.  By 2020, there will be an estimated demand for 7 million houses, an increase of 3.9 million units from current levels.  The major constraint on the development of the real estate sector is the lack of sufficient availability in housing finance.Establishment of Replicable Business Model in the Region:  The business model of the NewCo will send a powerful signal on the best practice of the corporate governance and the operations to current and potential market participants.  KIC/NewCo is completely on board with these views, as shown by its negotiations with HDFC for capacity-building technical assistance.Capital Markets Development: The IFC Loan would provide the NewCo with access to long-term funds to acquire and lease a steady stream of properties initially financed by the IFC Loan. The revolving nature of the IFC Loan provides support for the NewCos potential securitization activity, and further accelerates the development of mortgage finance/MBS securitization market in the country.Introduction of Sustainability Standards in Housing Construction: The acceptance and implementation of sustainability standards by DAAR and other developers whose residential products will be the source of origination for the NewCo will send an important and industry wide signal to the real estate sector in Saudi Arabia.

(UETCL), Ugandas national transmission company, to strengthen the evacuation of electricity from the project.  The project will be an Independent Power project (IPP) and will sell electricity to UETCL under a 30-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), which was signed on December 13, 2005.  BELs headquarters are in Kampala, Uganda.The project sponsors are Industrial Promotion Services (Kenya) Ltd.

The project will be built under an Engineering, Procurement, Construction (EPC) contract issued by BEL; the O&M operator of the plant is expected to be an affiliate company of Sithe Global.  UETCL will award the Interconnection Project EPC contract, and own, operate, and maintain the transmission facilities.  UETCL will contract BEL to play a management role in the design, procurement, and construction phases of the Interconnection Project.The hydropower facility will consist of a power station housing up to 5 X 50 MW turbine generators within a 28 m high earth-filled dam and spillway works.  The project will require 125 ha of permanent land take and 113 ha of temporary land take for the projects ancillary facilities.  The dam will impound a reservoir extending back to the tailrace area of the Nalubaale and Kiira facilities, inundating Bujagali Falls. The reservoir will be 388 ha (3.88 km2) in surface area, comprising the existing 308 ha of the Victoria Nile, and 80 ha of newly inundated land.  The reservoir waters will be contained within the steeply incised banks of the Victoria Nile between Dumbbell Island and Nalubaale, thereby minimizing the amount of newly inundated land. The associated Interconnection project being developed for UETCL involves the proposed construction and operation of the high voltage electrical transmission infrastructure needed in part to interconnect the proposed Bujagali Hydropower project to the national electrical grid and to strengthen the evacuation of electricity from the project. The proposed IP includes a 70 km transmission line to convey power generated to a new substation to be located in Kawanda, on the outskirts of Kampala; a 17 km transmission line to connect the Kawanda substation to the existing Mutundwe substation located in the southwest section of Kampala, where some minor upgrades will be needed to accept the new line; and, two 5 km transmission lines to establish interconnections between Bujagali and the Tororo substation in eastern Uganda and the Nalubaale substation in Jinja.","","","","IFC conducted its social and environmental review of the Bujagali Hydropower Project jointly with members of the World Bank Group (WBG) and other senior lenders.

The proponent had completed detailed social and environmental documentation, disclosed by IFC in March 2001, the majority of the public consultations and disclosure, and resettlement at the project site.  The project is substantially similar and updated from the one previously appraised by IFC; the contractor to be selected by the project sponsors is expected to make design and construction modifications to the project.The project sponsors have prepared a new comprehensive Social and Environmental Assessment (SEA) to address changes to the design and to the baseline environment in the affected areas, and have conducted additional formal and informal consultations in Uganda regarding the new circumstances of the project.  WBG staff has maintained contact with the project in the period since 2003, and participated in consultations.  IFC staff visited the project site in March 2006 and reviewed iterations of the SEA in March, September, and November 2006.","","","","","","","","","","","","The Bujagali Hydropower Project will involve the construction and operation of a dam in the bed of the Nile River, immediately downstream from a hydroelectric complex, and upstream of protected natural areas as well as other planned hydroelectric facilities.  Bujagali will be operated as a run-of-river plant.  It will impound a reservoir of 388 ha in surface area (comprising the existing 308 ha of the Victoria Nile, and 80 ha of newly inundated land), and operate in consort with the upstream facilities.  Two managed, natural, or protected areas, the Jinja Wildlife Sanctuary and Bujagali Falls will be affected and these impacts will be offset through the designation of new areas to replace those lost due to development of Bujagali.Land required for the hydropower project has caused several hundreds of people to be affected through physical and/or economic displacement.

The project will be an Independent Power Project (IPP) and will sell electricity to UETCL under a 30-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), which was signed on December 13, 2005.  UETCLs payment obligations under the PPA will be guaranteed by the Government of Uganda (GOU) through a government guarantee.","","","","","","The project is expected to have a major economic and developmental impact on Uganda. The current energy crisis faced by Uganda has led to significant load shedding. As a result, the GoU is forced to rely on an additional 100 MW of expensive thermal power to mitigate the problem and has had to almost double tariffs in 2006. Some business users have resorted to importing backup diesel generators, but many other users cannot afford them. This is constraining economic growth, particularly in the industrial sector.The project will: - displace at least an estimated 50MW of expensive emergency thermal power when it is commissioned in 2011;- relieve residual load shedding; and - meet incremental base load demand with least cost power generation. This will prevent further rises in electricity tariffs and may allow a decrease. It will enable more residential users to be connected every year, including in rural areas. It will also allow industrial and commercial users to reduce their costs and increase their productivity, thereby boosting economic growth. Availability of cost effective electricity will also increase the attractiveness of Uganda as an investment destination. During the construction phase of the dam, the project is expected to create 600-1,100 jobs for Ugandan nationals, some 10% of whom are to be hired from local communities. The community development action plan (CDAP) for the project includes strengthening of educational and health services and provision of clean water to affected communities. By recycling the same water that is already used to generate power at Nalubaale and Kiira, the project reduces the pressure to over-release water from Lake Victoria, thereby helping to preserve lake levels and facilitate the GOUs compliance with the Agreed Curve.  Through the displacement of thermal power that would otherwise be needed, the project reduces carbon and other pollutant emissions.The project would be Ugandas first IPP and one of the largest mobilizations of private financing for an IPP project in Africa.   The project would strengthen Ugandas achievement of comprehensive reforms in the power sector, started in 1999 with support from the World Bank Group.  As such, it would facilitate further private sector investment in Uganda and have important demonstration effects in the region.  On the other hand, failure to implement the project would be very costly for the country, as more expensive energy sources would have to be developed, and power sector reforms may be jeopardized.","","","","","The Bujagali Hydropower Project will involve the construction and operation of a dam in the bed of the Nile River, immediately downstream of a hydroelectric complex, and upstream of protected natural areas as well as other planned hydroelectric facilities.

IPI will be 99% owned by the Frem Industrial Group SAL (Holding) (FIG or the sponsor), 0.5% by INDEVCO SAL, and 0.5% by Unipak Nile Ltd., which are part of the INDEVCO Group of Lebanon (the Group).  The group owns and operates a profitable 30,000 tons per annum (tpa) tissue mill in Lebanon, selling to clients in the Middle East and the UK.  This tissue mill, despite a recent increase in capacity from 18,000 tpa to 30,000 tpa, is finding it difficult to keep up with demand, hence the Groups decision to construct another tissue mill in Egypt, where electricity, energy and labor costs are lower.  The project will be manufacturing jumbo tissue rolls and mainly exporting to converters outside Egypt.","","","","","","The project will supply various grades of jumbo rolls to Middle East, Europe and African markets for the conversion into tissue paper products, which will further promote Egyptian exports.  Its exports to Europe will benefit from low backhaul rates.  The project is also expected to use world class production technology to process domestic recycled waste paper and imported virgin pulp.  This will increase incentives of its suppliers to collect and recycle more waste paper.  The benefits of recycling include reduction of pollution, salvage forest trees, energy and water savings.  The project is expected to create 170 direct jobs at the mill and an additional 1,000 jobs indirectly in local wastepaper collection in Egypt, where the unemployment rate is approximately 10% in 2005.  The sponsors of the project have been active in the communities in which they operate and IPI will adopt a similar approach.  The bulk of INDEVCO Groups community engagement is handled by the INDEVCO Foundation (recently renamed the Georges N. Frem Foundation after the recently deceased founder of INDEVCO Group).  The Georges N. Frem Foundation is active in the education, civil society, social welfare, community and economic development areas.  Furthermore, the INDEVCO Group has a strong record in Egypt in Unipak Nile, with a focus on quality control, ISO and other certifications which have a continuing positive demonstration effect in raising the quality of local manufacturing companies.  The project will reinforce this effort and provide an ongoing model for business success.","","","","","Based on the site visit to Sadat City and to Unipak Nile, discussions with the client and with the civil administration in Sadat City (the Mayor), the project will have limited potential adverse environmental and social impacts. Also any impacts will be few in number, site-specific, reversible and easily addressed through agreed mitigation measures.  As a result of the above this is a Category B project.The client has presented plans to address any impacts to ensure that the proposed project will upon implementation of the specific agreed measures, comply with the environmental and social requirements of Egypt as well as the IFC environment and social policies and the environmental, health and safety guidelines.  The information about how these potential impacts will be addressed by the project is summarized in the paragraphs that follow.  A site for this project has been selected and purchased and the Mayor of Sadat City has approved the site, and IPI has begun the process of obtaining all the necessary permits.  Applications for all the relevant Egyptian permits will be sent to IFC for review and comment to ensure that the project complies with IFCs requirements.  Any information deficiencies in terms of compliance with IFCs requirements will be addressed by the client as will any potential noncompliance issues (in an Action Plan).  The management of IPI as well as their parent, INDEVCO Group, is committed to comply fully with all the Egyptian and IFC requirements.  At present an environmental and social management program is not required but this may change based on the results on the permit application review process.  Certainly IPI will be required to prepare policies and operational procedures on environment, labor, and occupational health and safety (this will be part of their agreed Action Plan).  IPI will achieve ISO 9000 (Quality) certification and the benefits of ISO 14001 (Environmental Management) and OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health and Safety) certifications were discussed with the client (as was the 6 Sigma quality program), although IFC does not require these certifications. IPI will employ about 170 staff and will use the Human Resource (HR) policies and procedures developed and implemented by INDEVCO Group for use in all the Group companies.  INDEVCO Group has about 4,000 employees in the Middle East.  INDEVCO Group has a corporate HR Department that provides leadership, guidance and advice to the Group companies on HR issues.  Also IPI can use the knowledge and experience in Egypt of Unipak Nile (with 400 employees).  Consistent with INDEVCO Groups approach to HR, IPI will have its own HR Department but it will have to operate according to the Groups HR policies and procedures.  All new IPI employees will receive copies of the Groups HR policies and procedures and, consistent with Egyptian law, details in writing of their employment contract.  INDEVCO Group has an open door policy on grievance issues with all employees having the right to meet the President of the company or the General Manager.  All employees are aware of this right and are encouraged to use it if necessary.  INDEVCO Group views their employees at all levels as their primary resource and takes care to ensure they are well paid, properly trained, and have opportunities for advancement.  Currently IPI as a new company does not yet have an Occupational Health and Safety Management system (OHSMS).  With the assistance of INDEVCO Group and Unipak Nile, IPI will develop and implement an OHSMS acceptable to IFC.  IPI will buy its raw water from the Sadat City municipal system.  Pretreated wastewater will be discharged to the municipal sewer from the plant and then subject to additional treatment (i.e. sedimentation in this case) prior to reuse as non-food crop irrigation water  thus all the wastewater from the new plant will be reused.  Electricity to the plant will be supplied from the grid and natural gas will also be available for the boilers.  Waste paper of the proper quality will be recycled in the process.  Other solid waste will whenever possible be sold to a licensed contractor for recycling (e.g. paper, cardboard, plastic, glass and metal).  The remaining solid waste will be collected regularly by a licensed contractor for disposal in Sadat Citys landfill.  It is anticipated that the plant will meet both IFC and Egyptian environmental requirements.  IFC will review the Egyptian permit applications to ensure compliance with IFC and Egyptian requirements.  IPI plans to build and operate a very efficient mill based on their international experiences.  Plans are as follows: - Water: to limit water use to about 10 to 15 m3 per ton of tissue paper  the international best practice is about 25 m3 per ton of tissue paper; -  Energy: to use energy efficiently and limit its use to about 1,000 to 1,200 kwh per ton with international best practice at about 1,500 to 1,800 kwh per ton of tissue; -  Operational Characteristics: IPI plans to manufacture multiple products using varied inputs of raw materials.  This will require considerable flexibility in the tissue making process; and -  Quality: IPI intends to make high quality tissue products suitable for the European market at a reasonable cost.  There is a large and sophisticated waste paper recycling industry in Egypt particularly in and around Cairo.  There is an excellent supply of the correct quality of waste paper to meet IPIs needs for tissue production (50,000 tpa).  Currently Egypt collects about 100,000 tpa of waste paper and IPI expects to buy about 30,000 tpa of waste paper from the market.","The sponsor is a holding company incorporated in Lebanon in 1993.

Basic infrastructure (roads, electricity, water, sewer collection and treatment, phones etc.) and services (residential housing, schools, commercial centers etc.) are provided by the developers.","Based on the site visit to Sadat City and to Unipak Nile, discussions with the client and with the civil administration in Sadat City (the Mayor), the project will have limited potential adverse environmental and social impacts. Also any impacts will be few in number, site-specific, reversible and easily addressed through agreed mitigation measures.  As a result of the above this is a Category B project.The client has presented plans to address any impacts to ensure that the proposed project will upon implementation of the specific agreed measures, comply with the environmental and social requirements of Egypt as well as the IFC environment and social policies and the environmental, health and safety guidelines.  The information about how these potential impacts will be addressed by the project is summarized in the paragraphs that follow.  A site for this project has been selected and purchased and the Mayor of Sadat City has approved the site, and IPI has begun the process of obtaining all the necessary permits.  Applications for all the relevant Egyptian permits will be sent to IFC for review and comment to ensure that the project complies with IFCs requirements.  Any information deficiencies in terms of compliance with IFCs requirements will be addressed by the client as will any potential noncompliance issues (in an Action Plan).  The management of IPI as well as their parent, INDEVCO Group, is committed to comply fully with all the Egyptian and IFC requirements.  At present an environmental and social management program is not required but this may change based on the results on the permit application review process.  Certainly IPI will be required to prepare policies and operational procedures on environment, labor, and occupational health and safety (this will be part of their agreed Action Plan).  IPI will achieve ISO 9000 (Quality) certification and the benefits of ISO 14001 (Environmental Management) and OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health and Safety) certifications were discussed with the client (as was the 6 Sigma quality program), although IFC does not require these certifications. IPI will employ about 170 staff and will use the Human Resource (HR) policies and procedures developed and implemented by INDEVCO Group for use in all the Group companies.  INDEVCO Group has about 4,000 employees in the Middle East.  INDEVCO Group has a corporate HR Department that provides leadership, guidance and advice to the Group companies on HR issues.  Also IPI can use the knowledge and experience in Egypt of Unipak Nile (with 400 employees).  Consistent with INDEVCO Groups approach to HR, IPI will have its own HR Department but it will have to operate according to the Groups HR policies and procedures.  All new IPI employees will receive copies of the Groups HR policies and procedures and, consistent with Egyptian law, details in writing of their employment contract.  INDEVCO Group has an open door policy on grievance issues with all employees having the right to meet the President of the company or the General Manager.  All employees are aware of this right and are encouraged to use it if necessary.  INDEVCO Group views their employees at all levels as their primary resource and takes care to ensure they are well paid, properly trained, and have opportunities for advancement.  Currently IPI as a new company does not yet have an Occupational Health and Safety Management system (OHSMS).  With the assistance of INDEVCO Group and Unipak Nile, IPI will develop and implement an OHSMS acceptable to IFC.  IPI will buy its raw water from the Sadat City municipal system.  Pretreated wastewater will be discharged to the municipal sewer from the plant and then subject to additional treatment (i.e. sedimentation in this case) prior to reuse as non-food crop irrigation water  thus all the wastewater from the new plant will be reused.  Electricity to the plant will be supplied from the grid and natural gas will also be available for the boilers.  Waste paper of the proper quality will be recycled in the process.  Other solid waste will whenever possible be sold to a licensed contractor for recycling (e.g. paper, cardboard, plastic, glass and metal).  The remaining solid waste will be collected regularly by a licensed contractor for disposal in Sadat Citys landfill.  It is anticipated that the plant will meet both IFC and Egyptian environmental requirements.  IFC will review the Egyptian permit applications to ensure compliance with IFC and Egyptian requirements.  IPI plans to build and operate a very efficient mill based on their international experiences.  Plans are as follows: - Water: to limit water use to about 10 to 15 m3 per ton of tissue paper  the international best practice is about 25 m3 per ton of tissue paper; -  Energy: to use energy efficiently and limit its use to about 1,000 to 1,200 kwh per ton with international best practice at about 1,500 to 1,800 kwh per ton of tissue; -  Operational Characteristics: IPI plans to manufacture multiple products using varied inputs of raw materials.  This will require considerable flexibility in the tissue making process; and -  Quality: IPI intends to make high quality tissue products suitable for the European market at a reasonable cost.  There is a large and sophisticated waste paper recycling industry in Egypt particularly in and around Cairo.  There is an excellent supply of the correct quality of waste paper to meet IPIs needs for tissue production (50,000 tpa).  Currently Egypt collects about 100,000 tpa of waste paper and IPI expects to buy about 30,000 tpa of waste paper from the market.","","","","",25136,"",AD - Paper Tissue,"","","",""

Limestone (Rudnik Krecnjaka Vijenac) and brine (Rudnik Soli Tusanj Tuzla) production facilities are owned and operated by the Tuzla Cantonal government. Coal facilities are under the administration of the Federation of BiH. The plant is disposing solid waste inside the plant (carbonate and black sea) and outside the plant (white seas covering an area of 56ha). Exports take place by truck or railway, mainly thru the port of Ploce located on the Adriatic Sea near Dubrovnik in Croatia. Soda Sanayii is currently executing an investment program aimed at refurbishing, upgrading and expanding SSL production facilities. The total project cost is estimated to be about $30 million. IFC has been requested to provide a 24 million project finance loan to fund the Companys 5-year capital expenditure program. SSL plans to complete its expansion program by end of 2009 with full production of 250,000tpa by 2011.","","","","The review of this project consisted of appraising technical, environmental and social information submitted by the company and its consultants and a two-day appraisal visit by two environmental specialists to the soda ash plant located in Lukavac. Documentation reviewed includes the following documents: - Feasibility Study for the Acquisition of Fabrika Sode Lukavac / Bosnia and Herzegovina by Sisecam dated June 2006;- Report named Some considerations about present and future HSE issues of Sisecam Soda Lukavac by Soda Sanayii dated October 2006; and - Environmental, Health and Safety Due Diligence Assessment of Sisecam Sode Lukavac d.o.o. by Citrus Partners, Twickenham, UK dated January 2007. The appraisal team interviewed the corporate and site operations managers, as well as corporate and site EHS managers. A very detailed site visit to the companys operations at Lukavac, Canton Of Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina took place during appraisal in November 2006. A final discussion on the Action Plan took place in Mersin, Turkey in January 2007 with Soda Sanayii management.As Sisecam is an old IFC client the new (Performance Standards) PS have been provided to and discussed with the client in Istanbul as well as in Mersin and Lukavac. It has been agreed at the end of the appraisal that an independent HSE audit was necessary to assess past liabilities, review compliance with BiH regulations and support improved environmental and safety management after the privatization. The Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Assessment has been completed in January 2007 with subsequent corrective actions included in an Action Plan (EHS Action Plan). It is anticipated that the proposed project will comply over a period of 3 years with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) laws and regulations and IFC requirements. Based on the audit findings and Action Plan activities, SSL will need to develop and implement a complete set of environmental, community engagement, occupational health and safety management plans to meet best practice as well as IFC PS.","","","","","","","","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedures, because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria. The project involves modernization of the existing soda ash production i.e. modernization of lime kilns which will increase the production level, improve products quality and EHS performance. The key social and environmental aspects associated with the project include:-  Air emissions control, and effluent and waste management including monitoring;-  Plant site past contamination and associated facilities review;-  White and Black (Sea) Mud Storage-  Housekeeping and Occupational health and safety issues;-  Corporate capacity in environmental management; and-  Sustainable community relations.Soda Sanayii has endorsed all findings, management recommendations, subsequent studies proposals and Action Plan activities included in the EHS Assessment.

The company's initial project, Lircay, is a 20 Megawatt (MW) run-of-river hydropower project located along the Lircay River in the VII Region of Chile, approximately 30 km to the northeast of the city of Talca.  The project is expected to have a construction period of approximately 18-24 months.

The Lircay hydropower project takes advantage of water rights owned by the Canal Maule Association, a long-established irrigation group formed mainly by medium and small agriculturists and with approximately 2,200 shareholders.  The Association utilizes water in the Maule River that is stored upstream in the Maule Reservoir, diverted at the Armerillo intake and distributed through two primary canals  Maule Norte Alto and Maule Norte Bajo.  The Lircay project is made possible through a surplus of water during wet periods of the year and as a result of topographic relief at a point on the Maule Norte Bajo that over looks the confluence of the Corel and Lircay rivers.  Up to 28.20 m3/sec of canal flow and a head of 107 meters are available at this location.

During the season of irrigation (mid-September through mid-April) water is available for power generation only to the extent that flow exceeds irrigation requirements.  The rest of the year water is available up to the 54.32 m3/sec of water rights owned by the Association.  The company has used the 40-year period of record for flow in the Maule River to optimize the size of the Lircay plant for year-round operation.

Infrastructure required for the Lircay project includes a diversion structure on the Maule Norte Bajo canal, a 2,950 meter-long canal to bring the diverted water to a point overlooking the powerhouse, a 520 meter long steel penstock pipe to the powerhouse, and a powerhouse with two Francis-type turbine-generator groups with a 9.7 MW capacity each.

Of existing generation capacity, approximately 42% is coal or gas-fired.  Over the last three years, there have been significant cuts in gas volumes imported from Argentina, especially during the critical winter months, because of limited production capacity in Argentina.  Although these reductions in gas volumes have not had an impact in the residential sector, they have created problems for generators and industry in general, who have on occasion experienced complete loss of gas volumes for several days, impairing their production capability.   Due to this problem, Chile has sought a number of possible alternative sources of fuel.  These efforts include: 

- exploration for gas in the southern region of Magallanes;
- importing LNG from Australia and Indonesia; and 
- development of new renewable energy plants, to include wind power and hydropower.  

Being a run-of-the river project, with a very low marginal cost of power, the project will lower the cost of electricity to its major offtakers and therefore help support a lower cost structure for industries in Chile.  Given that the hydrology of project site is very well studied, it will also be able to do so with a great degree of reliability, without burning fossil fuels.  The project will thus help reduce Chile's NO2 and CO2 emissions by displacing thermal power generation in the economic dispatch order.","","","","","","Hidromaule is as Chilean Sociedad Anonima established in 2005.

A baseline survey done by GTZ in 2006 shows that only 7.5% of enterprises surveyed (primarily SMEs) have received financing through banks while 68% indicated demand for loans. With regard to household and retail finance, penetration of banking services in Laos is extremely low as an estimated 90% of household savings are in the form of 'under-the-mattress' cash instead of bank accounts; it is estimated that only 5% of the population has a bank account. Underpinned by increasing trade and industrial expansion (mainly infrastructure and mining), Laos recorded real GDP growth at 7.3% in 2005, a level that is forecasted to reach 7.2% for 2006 (EIU) and averaging 6.7% in 2007-2008.

Bank Republic,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,Georgia,Bank Republic JSC,"Global Industry, Financial Markets",2007-02-09T05:00:00Z,2007-03-15T04:00:00Z,FI,Loan,"Bank Republic (BR or the Bank) was founded in 1991, when Georgia was making its first steps towards democracy and free market economy by a group of private entrepreneurs and companies from aviation, transport, telecom, and energy sectors.  Since inception, the Bank has focused on corporate banking including large state-owned and private companies of strategic importance to Georgia.  Acquisitions of two smaller local banks in 1995-96 contributed to the Bank''s growth of assets and resource base.  In 1996, the Banks first international audit was performed by KPMG.  In 2002-2003 BR broadened its product range by adding retail banking, which is now the second major business line for the Bank.As of December 31, 2006 the Banks total assets amounted to GEL 350 million ($204 million equivalent) representing 8.3% of the total assets of the Georgian banking sector.  Bank Republics equity amounted to GEL 63 million ($36.6 million equivalent).  The Bank holds a 11.3% share of total deposits and 12.2% share of deposits of individuals. Most of the Banks business has historically concentrated in Tbilisi, but in 2000-2001, the management developed and started to implement a branch network expansion plan.  Currently, BR operates 7 branches and 16 offices (service centers) located in Georgias main industrial and economic centers.  All of Banks branches serve both corporate and individual clients, while offices (service centers) provide banking service solely to individuals.  Over time, BR is planning to convert all offices into universal ones.  Bank Republic stands out among its peers in three respects:- its strong record of profitability in the past few years; - clearly formulated SME- and retail-oriented business development strategy; and - as the first strategic acquisition of a Georgian bank by a leading West European banking group with the purchase of 60% of the Banks shares by Societe Generale (SG) in September 2006. These three factors, and in particular, an opportunity to support growth of lending to private SMEs in a frontier country such as Georgia through IFCs relationship with SG constitute the main rationale for this transaction.  The acquisition of a controlling stake in Bank Republic, one of Georgias leading banks, is in line with the development strategy of Societe Generales international retail business.  It is expected that SG will build on strategic efforts of BRs local shareholders in the past two years to develop retail lending in one of the most frontier countries of Eastern Europe.","","","","","","The expected development impact of this project is high, because of achieving the following objectives in a frontier country:- Contribute to further development of one of the leading Georgian banks by assisting BR in meeting increasing demand for credit from SMEs.  BR plays an important role in terms of strengthening public confidence in the banking sector in general, providing financial intermediation in the Georgian economy and providing a role model for other banking institutions in the market. The importance of BR for Georgian banking sector increased after its acquisition by SG, since the latter is expected to bring to the Bank best international practices in product structuring and risk management. The partnership of Societe Generale and Bank Republic is expected to result in a transfer of SGs universal banking expertise and product know-how to Georgia. Combined with BRs well-known local brand, its strong domestic distribution channels, local expertise, and high-quality local management, this is likely to make Bank Republic a leading financial institution in Georgia and broaden access of Georgian companies, including SMEs, and individuals to high quality banking services and products.- Facilitate the development of the SME sector and subsequent job creation in the country by improving SME access to finance from a well-managed local bank supported by an international strategic investor. - Support efforts of one of the leading Georgian banks to diversify and to increase the maturity of its liabilities and therefore, better manage its asset and liability position.","","","","","This project has been classified as a Category FI project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

The project is being developed by the INDEVCO Group, a major industrial group which already has paper making operations in Egypt, namely Unipak Nile in 6th of October City.  Unipak Nile is already an IFC client.  INDEVCO has other manufacturing operation in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Lebanon. the Gulf region, the European Union, the United States, and Brazil.  Raw material for the tissue mill will be a mixture of recycled paper and virgin pulp, depending on the quality of the tissue required.","","","","IFCs review of this project consisted of appraising a wide variety of technical, environmental, health and safety, labor, community and social information provided by the client.  In addition discussions on environment, health and safety, and labor were held with relevant corporate and project staff in Egypt and Lebanon including senior operations and technical management, the Directors of Human Resources and Research and Development, and the Manager of Communications who is responsible for permitting of the new mill in Sadat City.  The Executive Director of the INDEVCO Foundation (recently renamed the Georges N. Frem Foundation) in Lebanon provided many details of the Groups extensive community and social activities.  With regard to the issues of recycled paper and cardboard in and around Cairo, meetings were held with the General Manager of the Brotherhood for Paper Industry and Trading, the largest paper recycling company in Egypt with a capacity of about 75,000 tpa.  Plant visits were made to the Unipak Nile cardboard plant in Egypt and to the Unipak Tissue Mill in Lebanon.  The IFC team also visited the proposed new plant site in Sadat City, Egypt.","","","","","","","","","","","","Based on the site visit to Sadat City and to Unipak operations in Egypt and Lebanon, discussions with the client and with the civil administration in Sadat City (the Mayor), this project will have limited potential adverse environmental and social impacts. Also any impacts will be few in number, site-specific, reversible and easily addressed through agreed mitigation measures.  As a result of the above this is a Category B project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedures.","","","","",25136,"",AD - Paper Tissue,"","","",""

The government has stated repeatedly that the cement industry needs to update its technologies to cleaner, more energy efficient New Suspension Pre-heater (NSP) technology, and undergo an industry consolidation.  In the past few years, the government has implemented a series of regulations aimed at ensuring that all new cement facilities use NSP technology, and that producers using Vertical Shaft Kiln (VSK) technology are phased out.  These regulations have been partially successful, as the number of cement manufacturers nation-wide has fallen from over 8,000 to less than 5,000 over the past five years.  Over the same period, the percentage of cement produced using NSP technology has increased from about 25-30% to over 50% nation-wide.  The project will accelerate the consolidation process and solidify Tianrui's position as regional industry leader, thereby furthering the country's development goals and helping to rationalize the Chinese cement industry.

- Support for the Development of Central and Northeastern Provinces in China: 

The government has encouraged greater development in the Western (including central provinces such as Henan) and Northeastern (including Liaoning) provinces of China, in an attempt to establish a more balanced and harmonious development approach, and counter-balance the very fast development along the eastern coast of China.  This Project, with its investment in Henan and Liaoning, fits well into the government's broader development goals for the country.","","","","","The proposed project is to improve and expand Tianruis production based within its existing operation sites.

The cable will have an initial equipped capacity of 20Gbits/sec, and an ultimate capacity when fully upgraded of 320Gbits/sec.  The route will be from South Africa to Sudan, covering about 8,500 km, and connecting the following countries: South Africa, Mozambique, Madagascar, Tanzania, Kenya, Somalia, Djibouti and Sudan.  Twenty-eight leading telecommunications operators (the Operators) from East and Southern Africa signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in December 2003 to carry out the construction and maintenance of EASSy.  EASSy will be the first optical fiber connection for most of these countries to the global optical fiber network.  In separate projects, EASSy signatories are working on the development of terrestrial backhaul connections to link land-locked countries of the region to the cable (including Botswana, Burundi, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe).The Hybrid Model for the financing and ownership of EASSy is composed of two parts:- a Special Purpose Vehicle (the SPV), which will receive funding from the private-sector arms of the involved DFIs, including IFC, to create a commercially viable structure which meets open access policy objectives as well as supporting some operators (the SPV Operators) to fund their investment in the Project; and - a Consortium, which will be composed of those operators (the Consortium Operators) that elect not to join the SPV and, instead, make direct  investments in the EASSy cable. The SPV has recently been incorporated in Mauritius with the name of West Indian Ocean Cable Company Ltd. It will be majority owned by the SPV Operators.  The SPV will have its own by-laws, Board of Directors and professional management team.  It will function as a commercial entity which will manage, market and sell or lease its capacity to SPV Operators and any other authorized third parties.  IFC has been asked to provide financing to the SPV, along with five other DFIs including EIB, AfDB, DBSA, AFD/Proparco, and KfW. The funds will be used to finance that share of the Project cost resulting from the projected capacity requirements of the SPV Operators (the SPV Project Cost), as well as certain preparation and start-up expenses. The SPV Project Cost will ultimately depend on the composition of the SPV, which has yet to be finalized; however, in the current scenario which assumes 14 SPV Operators, the SPV project cost is approximately $120 million.","","","","","","The objective of this Project is to increase accessibility of countries in the region to the worlds global backbone communications network by providing high speed broadband connectivity, significantly reducing the current prohibitive cost of telephony and internet services in Eastern and Southern Africa.  Currently most of the region is served by restricted and expensive satellite requiring transit through third countries outside the region for country to country communication and information exchange.  As mentioned earlier, terrestrial backbone networks are also being built in separate developments to link all capitals and major cities in Eastern and Southern Africa to the EASSy cable and the international backbone system.  The Project is expected to have the following development outcomes:- Significantly increasing the supply of high quality reliable broadband capacity and simultaneously reducing wholesale bandwidth costs, supporting a parallel reduction in end-user prices for telecommunications service, thereby boosting regional competitiveness and enabling Africa to participate more fully in the global information economy. This is expected to help provide the conditions for growth of existing businesses and to attract new enterprises which need modern low cost connectivity.  The improved access to the internet resulting from the project would also benefit educational and medical institutions and will help boost general computer usage and literacy.- Fostering an open, non-discriminatory communications regime that ensures that capacity is available to all at a fair price: the EASSy SPV will sell capacity to all authorized purchasers thereby ensuring competition. This mechanism is designed to encourage open access and the charging of fair prices.  - Promoting private-sector led models for ICT infrastructure development in the region:  The EASSy Cable will be financed on a commercial basis, using a combination of operator equity and debt from private sector DFIs (via the EASSy SPV). This financing and ownership structure is in line with the World Banks strategy of maximizing private sector participation in the ICT sector.- Promoting regional integration through the sharing of infrastructure facilities.","","","","","Based on review of the project information, key social and environmental issues associated with the project include:  right of way selection, impacts on natural habitats, land acquisition, community engagement, labor standards, and social and environmental management systems.

Phase 2, which will cover SEIAs for the eight different landing point countries, will include completion of SEIAs to meet national and IFC Performance Standard requirements.  It is anticipated these SEIAs will be completed over the next 12 months as the respective national operator project is physically defined.  Phase 1 is a KfW funded and managed process and Phase 2 is AfDB funded and managed; IFCs Environment and Social Development Department has been coordinating with these partners (and the World Bank) on the scope and depth of the SEIAs required.  The Phase 1 SEIA reveals that in 4 of 8 landing sites the cable will avoid direct impacts on sensitive habitats and fishermen by following existing cables/channels and using existing landing points through shallow water.  Phase 1 also includes development of a Corporate (umbrella) Social and Environmental Management Plan (SEMP) and an SEMP model, which Phase 2 SEIAs must develop, resulting in an integrated SEMP which will govern national and international level operations.

These are predominantly well-established, African carriers in their home countries.  There is an approximately equal mix of government-owned institutions and those which are private.  Each party has a successful record of implementing telecommunications services in its home market(s).  There are a small number of international telecom operators among the sponsors, which bring a beneficial interest to the EASSy transaction through their ability to provide onward connectivity to other continents including Europe and Asia.","Total project cost of the EASSy cable to be financed by the SPV and Consortium Operators is estimated at $235 million. The cable is to be designed, constructed, operated and maintained according to a Construction and Maintenance Agreement (C&MA) signed by Operators and the SPV.

In the first closing of the Fund, IFC will invest up to $15M.  Additional $5M may be invested in subsequent closings based on fund-raising progress.  This represents a slight increase from the original SPI which proposed up to $15M.  Alta Growth will be structured as a Canadian limited partnership, with a target size of at least $150 million.  The Fund will focus on businesses in the under served lower end of the middle market where there is substantial deal flow with low competition from bank and local private equity funds. The Fund will seek to make 8-10 investments with an average investment size of $10-20 million. Alta Growths investment strategy has developed as a response to shrinking financing to Mexican small and medium enterprises (SMEs) over the last decade.  While financing to companies has decreased, consumer lending (including credit cards and mortgages) is growing.  This combination has created a financing gap.  Without growth capital, local companies will not keep up with current demand.","","","","","","The Fund will contribute to the economic development of Mexico by supporting 8-10 medium size companies. Shrinking bank financing has left middle-market companies with few funding alternatives.  The Fund is well positioned in Mexico to invest in good mid-size companies that need a strong partner to help them develop and succeed in an increasingly competitive global marketplace.  The experience of the Alta Growth team in private equity investment, financial restructuring and corporate governance will be important components of these companies growth and development.

The country has since seen an increased use of PVC in agriculture, particularly for drainage purposes which has made substantial contribution to agricultural productivity and introduction of micro-irrigation, resource saving and reversing long run declines in water quality and agricultural land management.  Given the impact of the existing operations, the PVC expansion and strengthening of the companys position, through its backward integration, will serve to continue these positive impacts on the market.The longer tenor of the IFC loan will help improve EAPCLs cash flow during the trough periods, while allowing it to make the investments required to maintain efficient and competitive operations.  This same factor proved critical to the Company for the first IFC investment, particularly during the down cycle years of 2001-2002 where the Company had experience shrinking margins.  Lastly, the project will help generate additional employment as the new facility is expected to employ an additional 200 direct hire manpower.  Moreover, the new caustic soda facility is expected to generate substantial employment in the salt industry, a key raw material for the production of caustic soda and chlorine.  As the salt industry is quite labor intensive, this new plant is expected to generate the need for an additional 100 direct employees in the salt business.","","","","","IFC''s review of this investment has covered the following environmental, social, health and safety aspects: - corporate environmental and social management, - waste water treatment and discharge,- air emissions from processes and utilities, - hazardous material management, - solid/hazardous waste management, - labor issues,- occupational health and safety programs, - fire prevention and emergency response, and- community safety/relationship/development.

The company is over 40 years old and, while its background is in the mining business, the company is currently the largest private generator of wind power in the country (installed capacity is 111.6 MW as of July 2006).  In FY 2006, sales of iron ore represented 91% of total revenues, while sales of wind energy represented 8% of total revenues.

The project consists of the installation, operation and maintenance of 36.6 MW of wind power generators in the states of Karnataka and Gujarat in India, to be implemented by MSPL. Electricity will be sold through long-term power purchase agreements to state-owned electricity distribution companies.  After the project, MSPL's wind portfolio would be 148.2 MW.","","","","","","- Renewable energy:

The project will contribute to increase the country's installed capacity from renewable energy sources and will contribute to the development of cleaner sources of energy. IFC's support of this and similar projects will help increase the production of wind energy in India, a zero-emission energy source. The project will contribute to meeting India's goal of increasing power generated from renewable energy from the current level of 5% to 25% by 2030 and is expected to benefit from carbon credits.  This could have positive demonstration effects on other potential generators of renewable energy. 

- Reduction of power shortages:

India faces severe shortages of electricity, with peak shortages estimated at approximately 12% of total demand. The project will contribute to reduce this demand-supply gap, which has resulted in erratic supply of electricity with fluctuations in voltage and/or power outages. The consequences of the power shortage are far-reaching and adversely impact commerce, industry, agriculture, education, and socioeconomic development. 

- Hedge against high fuel prices:

Diversifying India's generation portfolio and investing in wind power offers a hedge against potential future increases in fossil fuel prices.  

- Linkages to local economy:

It is estimated that the equipment produced locally by wind turbine manufacturers has 80% of domestic content; this creates jobs and linkages to the local economy.","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects.

This project will reduce the N2O emissions from Omnia Fertilizers nitric acid plant by up to 98% by installing an N2O catalytic reduction facility in the tail gas section of the process downstream of the absorption tower.  Implementation of the project will result in GHG emission reductions, conservatively calculated between ~550,000  ~580,000 tCO2e per year.   Thus, in 2008, for example, total tCO2e will be reduced from ~615,000 to ~33,000 tCO2e. Catalytic reduction of N2O occurs when the N2O reacts with a reducing agent in contact with a catalyst.  The reaction removes the oxygen from the N2O molecules and forms one or more compounds.  This project activity will result in revenue to Omnia from the sale of CER''s, which will be utilized to defray significant capital investment and ongoing maintenance costs for the facility.  The project brings not only environmental benefits in the form of reduced N2O and NOx emissions but also, as the first nitric acid plant in South Africa to seek registration, it can act as the catalyst to encourage other South African nitric acid producers to implement N2O reduction measures.

The demonstration effect and the experience to be gained by commercial lenders to the MFI sector are expected to result in sustainable, commercial funding relationships. - Increase Exposure in Africa:Due to the increase in the facilitys size, shift in protection structure, and new incentive system, the project is expected to generate investment transactions in Africa than in the first GMF.","","","","","This project involves IFC support for the business of microfinance, and has been classified as a Category FI project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

The project also includes the construction of a 400 kV switchyard and a 32 km long 400 kV transmission line through which power will be evacuated from the project through a Loop-In-Loop-Out (LILO) arrangement with the 400 kV Korba-Seepat line of the regional grid maintained by Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL); and construction of a raw water intake pump house on the banks of River Hasdeo and laying of about 4 km long buried raw water pipeline.  The project will be implemented in two units of 300 MW each and will procure coal from the coal fields of South Eastern Coal Fields Limited (SECL) under a basket linkage agreement with SECL. The coal will be transported by rail from the mines and a 1.75 km long railway siding for coal receipt, is also proposed. IFC is proposing an equity investment in the project company.","","","","Lanco Amarkantak Power Private Limited (LAPPL or the company) is setting up a 2 x 300 MW coal based power plant near village Patadi in Korba District, in the state of Chhattisgarh, India. LAPPL and IFC are considering entering into a long term relationship through equity participation by IFC in LAPPL. LAPPL had carried out a Comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment (CEIA) for the period March 2004 to February 2005; conducted a public hearing for the project on August 25, 2004; was given environmental clearance dated November 19, 2004 by Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), Government of India (GoI); and had obtained No Objection Certificate (NOC) and Consent to Establish (CTE) from Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board (CECB) dated March 10, 2005.  From this paragraph onward is an update, as of November 19, 2007, reflecting new information and events that have taken place in the past 8 month period.  In addition a new document the Comprehensive Social Impact Assessment (CSIA) is attached:During October/November 2006, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) undertook their appraisal of the Lanco Amarkantak Project as documented in the original Environmental and Social Review Summary, disclosed in March of 2007 at the InfoShop and locally.  The first phase of the land acquisition process was already completed by that time.  However, in keeping with LANCO Groups corporate philosophy on stakeholder value creation and IFCs Performance Standards (PS), LAPPL commissioned an independent, third party consultant, M/s. Development Management Consultants, Kolkata (DMC), to undertake a Comprehensive Social Impact Assessment (CSIA) in accordance with IFC Performance Standards.  Before embarking on the full-fledged CSIA study, DMC carried out a rapid socio-economic impact assessment (RSIA) during the period December 2006 to February 2007, to identify key project impacts on project affected persons (PAPs) and develop interim mitigation measures, pending a comprehensive mitigation plan to be developed under the CSIA, which was attached to the March 2007 ESRS and disclosed at that time.In Phase I, only the land required for the main plant (boiler, turbine-generator, etc.) and other facilities such as coal storage and handling system, ash handling plant, fuel oil, water storage and treatment systems, Unit 1 ash pond, etc. has been acquired.  The land acquired also includes about 25 acres for the operators housing colony.  The majority of the land required for developing a green belt is also part of the Phase I acquisition.Phase II land acquisition will cover ash pond of Unit 2, railway siding, balance of the green belt, etc.  The acquisition process has begun but is currently pending with the Industries Department, Government of Chhattisgarh.  The CSIA does not cover these areas but would eventually be supplemented to cover the impacts due to the acquisition of the additional 200 acres and posted when completed on this web site and disclosed locally.  While a substantial part of this land is government land, any acquisition from private land owners would be carried out in compliance with the LA Act provisions and State Government policies, guidelines and procedures and in accordance with IFCs Performance Standards.The Chhattisgarh Government provided the right of way/right of use for the corridor of land through which the pipeline bringing river water to the Plant and transmission line evacuating power from the power plant are routed.  In these cases, no land acquisition is involved, although there will be some temporary disturbance during construction.  During the period from April to June 2007, the companys consultants continued their work on the Comprehensive Social Impact Assessment and certain follow-up actions were taken by LAPPL with regard to interactions with the Project Affected Title-holders (PATs), other members of the Project Affected Households (PAHs), and communities in the Project Affected Villages (PAVs) in relation to their nominations for employment with the Project, community development activities, entitlement and rehabilitation, engagement, etc. The attached Comprehensive Social impact Assessment (CSIA) Report of October 2007 covers various components such as the existing social and economic conditions, Public Consultation and Disclosure Process (PCDP) and community engagement, evaluation of pre- and post- land acquisition incomes and livelihood options, identification and analysis of various impacts on the Project Affected People, mitigation measures comprising economic an Rehabilitation Action Plan a (RAP) and Community Development Plan (CDP), institutional mechanisms, action plans of the Company, and plans for evaluation of implementation of RAP and CDP. The main objectives of the study were to identify and mitigate potential social impacts and risks, meeting IFCs Performance Standards and disclosure requirements, enhancing positive socio-economic outcomes of the Project, and strengthening community consultations and relations.Conducting a socio-economic baseline survey is the first step in determining socio-economic status of affected persons and its objective is to monitor a PAPs socio-economic conditions at different stages of resettlement.  In the case of LAPPL, the host government had acquired the land and the acquisition process followed all the prevailing policy guidelines, norms and statutes both in regard to notifying the communities in advance, enumeration of assets, fixing of compensation and disbursing the compensation amounts to the affected households/persons.  As per the National Policy on R&R (NPRR) 2003, a Social Impact Assessment (SIA) is required only when 500 or more households are physically displaced.  Since this project did not involve physical displacement for acquisition of land, CSIDC did not undertake a SIA.  In this context, a separate census or socio-economic baseline survey was not carried out for affected people and, as a result, the baseline information was not originally available and the date of issuance of Notice by the District Collector was taken as the cut-off date.  The present survey completed by LAPPL covered all available PAPs in the four villages  Pahanda, Patadi, Saragbundia and Khoddle and an attempt has been made to understand and record the pre-land acquisition and post-land acquisition socio-economic status of the affected people.  However, in view of the fact that the survey was undertaken nearly 18 months after the cut-off date, information pertaining to baseline conditions prior to the land acquisition needs to be taken with this caveat.The total number of Project Affected Titleholders (PATs) is 302.  Of these, 98 PATs have been rendered landless and another 10 PATs are left with unviable parcels post Land Acquisition (LA), 15 PATs have lost structures like open wells and bore wells and one PAT required to be physically resettled as a house structure was on the land acquired.  Thirty-six (36) PATs are Scheduled Tribal (ST) households, of which 8 are women headed.The maximum number (110) of Project Affected Households (PAHs) is from the Village Khoddle. On the other hand, the maximum extent of land acquired for the Project from a single village (73% of total village land) is from Saragbundia.  The average family size of the respondent PAHs is 7 in Pahanda and Saragbundia while it is 9 in the other two PAVs.  Patadi and Pahanda have slightly more than 40% Scheduled Tribes (ST) population whereas Khoddle with maximum number of PAHs, has only 2.5% ST population, and the ST population in Saragbundia is about 29%.  Out of the 298 PAHs, only 36 belong to ST.  Scheduled Tribes in this region are mainstreamed into the local community.In addition to the public disclosure and consultation undertaken by the public authorities, in order to meet regulatory requirements for land acquisition and for obtaining environmental clearance, LAPPL officials met with the villagers from time to time to discuss the land acquisition processes, future development potential of the area and other benefits that the community would accrue.  However, these were not documented during the initial days prior to the commencement of LA Process by the Revenue authorities.  LAPPL has since facilitated quick access for the community members to the office of the Social Development Officer (SDO) of LAPPL.  The Company has developed a comprehensive Public Consultation and Disclosure plan for continuing community engagement, which is laid out in the attached CSIA.Prior to finalizing the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and Community Development Plan (CDP), community consultations (including focus group discussions) were conducted by the Consultants together with representatives of LAPPL (senior personnel from the corporate office, project office and the SDO have also taken part in these).  In some villages like Patadi, elderly women participated along with men and they were vocal in voicing their opinions during these meetings. LAPPL has made and disclosed to the PAHs two key commitments  - provision of permanent employment to one family member of each PAT family or alternative means of income ensuring that the monthly income is equal or more than the statutory Minimum Wage in the state, as per the policy of the state government and - implementation of a Community Development Plan (CDP) which have been developed based on the public consultations and needs assessment carried out with the help of the independent Consultant for each of the four affected villages.Some of the CDP activities have already been implemented in consultation with the villagers. Village Level Committees (VLCs) will be formed to facilitate implementation of Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and future CDP activities. This will ensure participatory responsibility of communities and LAPPL.  SDO has been profiled as the contact person and he","","","","","","","","","","","","The key social and environmental aspects that are/may be associated with the project relate to LAPPLs environment and social assessment and corporate environmental, social, and health and safety management systems and their implementation.  Further, in the context of the project, the issues include: - land acquisition and involuntary resettlement on account of the Plant as well as the associated facilities (railway siding spur) and right of way for water pipeline laying;- potential impacts on indigenous peoples and other vulnerable project affected persons; - emissions to soil, air, water and impacts on ambient conditions; - employee and community environment, health, safety and security during construction and operation; and - labor working conditions.  The impacts are diverse, some are irreversible and are not limited to the project site (e.g. GHG emissions, incremental impacts on ambient air quality, involuntary resettlement, etc.). While, in about 506 acres (or 205 hectare) of land acquired so far, there is no physical resettlement of the project affected people since their houses are not within the project land, some of these impacts are of significant scale (GHG emissions and involuntary resettlement). Since Korba has several coal based power projects already in operation, these impacts are not unprecedented and are also not likely to have impact on environmentally sensitive areas. Potential impacts during construction besides being mitigable are likely to be limited to project site and short term. It is though possible to readily design and implement engineering and management measures to mitigate adverse impacts due to: - emissions to soil, air and water;- management of hazardous materials and wastes;- employee and community health and safety during construction and operations; and - labor and working conditions. In view of the above, the project has been classified as a Category A project.","","","","",24880,"",AA - Coal - Thermal Power Generation,"","","",""

As a result, over the years, Kanoria developed a strong manufacturing capability and integrated production facilities in Renukoot, Uttar Pradesh and Ankleshwar, Gujarat.  The company is now in the process of increasing the production capacity of its caustic soda and chlorine derivative products to improve its profitability and growth while better serving the increasing needs of its growing customer base.  In addition, the company plans to invest over $25 million to gradually reduce production of caustic soda based on mercury cell technology by increasing production based on more environment friendly membrane cell technology. The company also has plans to finally phase out its mercury-cell based caustic soda capacity and replace it with more environmentally friendly membrane-cell based technology over the next few years.","","","","","","The proposed investment plan is expected to assist Kanorias efforts to become more internationally competitive by improving the companys operational efficiencies, rationalizing its capacities to meet market demand and achieve economies of scale.  Specifically, the following developmental benefits are expected to be achieved: - Sustainability Impact: The replacement of the companys mercury cell plant with a significantly more environmentally friendly membrane cell plant, in addition to the upgrading of the companys health and safety practices, would be among the benefits realized by the company.  The companys shareholders and management have developed a time table to eliminate mercury cell technology from its operations.  In addition, this conversion will have additional positive environmental impacts since the new membrane cell plant will be about 20% more energy efficient than the mercury cell plant.  Moreover, over time the companys need to handle and sell liquid chlorine is also expected to reduce. - Community Engagement:  Kanoria is active in various community and social development programs.  The increased financial stability afforded by the IFC financing should enable the company to afford to continue with such efforts.- Local Expenditures:The company sources a significant amount of materials and other services from local sources.  As the company and its operations grow, such purchases from local suppliers and service providers should also increase.- Preserving Employment:The company currently employs 1,055 salaried employees and an additional 1,295 contract workers.  The IFC financing is expected to help the company preserve jobs in a competitive and capital intensive industry.The key development indicators that are proposed to be monitored during the life of the IFC investment are: - reduction in amount of mercury sludge discharged; - reduction in amount of liquid chlorine sold; - annual spending on local SME suppliers; - annual spending on/implementation of community and social development programs; and - direct employment levels.","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review procedures because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

Progress in these respects could lead to substantial mine development focused on supplying strong growth of demand for steel making manufacturers in nearby China.","","","","","","The proposed IFC investment will contribute to continued exploration, feasibility studies and some infrastructure development for the companys main assets to allow for their future development which will require close to $1billion.  Consequently, it is not yet possible to fully quantify or specify the development impacts.  Potential development impacts at the mine production stage should include employment, federal, regional and local revenues, increased exports of iron ore.  Currently, ,for example, initial exploration and development work at Aricoms Kuranakh property employs 50 people from its nearest town Olekma, a town of 150 households.Both the Amur Oblast and the Evreskaya Autonomous Oblast, considered by IFC as Frontier Regions, are remote, relatively poor and undeveloped parts of Russia, with high unemployment.  So far gold has been the main new mining development in Amur as a result of Peter Hambro Minings Pokrovskiy project.  Aricoms developments will allow Amur and EAO to sell their lower unit value ferrous resources into the Chinese market at a transport cost advantage and help diversify their dependence on precious metals and oil and gas revenues.","","It is expected that a significant benefit of the potential future development of Aricoms developments will accrue to government I the form of taxes and royalties to different levels of government.  The current taxation system in Russia is complex and levied at the central, oblast and Raion (local) level.  The main tax categories are revenue taxes (including royalty, property and environmental taxes) and profit taxes.  The Amur Oblast has an official website (www.amurobl.ru) which discloses the full annual budget, the sources, the uses and implementation.  The Evreskaya Oblast also has an official website (www.eao.ru).  In addition, once Aricom brings its properties to production, Aricoms published accounts will summarize revenue payments to government.

A team of technical, environmental and social specialists undertook a weeks appraisal of the Kuranakh mine project and Kimkanskoye and Sutarskoye exploration site and interacted with the Companys consultants and management team on the project technical details, development plan and the environmental and social impact assessments and consultations conducted to-date, and has agreed the additional steps required thereafter.  The appraisal team has reviewed the technical, environmental and social documentation for the Kuranakh mine. The focus was on the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) prepared by an independent consultant in August 2006, and revision required to: -  reflect the need for a detailed Action Plan per IFC requirements, - highlight community engagement work done and additional information required on the socio-economic profile of the communities potentially impacted; and - assess opportunities for addtionalities regarding local economic development.  Aricoms Health, Safety, Environment, Community (HSEC) management, organization and systems planned for the construction and operational phases of the first mining project were discussed extensively with the Kuranakh team. Further meetings were also held with Aricoms senior corporate executives in the UK, and the exploration and mine development teams in Moscow and Blagoveschensk.  The maintenance of a healthy and safe working environment together with the welfare of both companys employees and the communities that are local to their projects is a key priority for Aricom. The IFC appraisal team met with representatives of the Olekma city council including the Mayor, the Head of the Regional Administration at Tynda, local health workers, and observed a public consultation meeting in Olekma.  Formal meetings with the Amur Administration in charge of Mining and Environment took place in Blagoveschensk and informal discussions with key stakeholders at Olekma and Isvestkovaya.","","","","","","","","","","","","The main driver for the IFC equity investment involvement is to support Aricoms further exploration, appraisal, feasibility studies and development of its K&S, Garinskoe and Bolshoi Sejm deposits, as a basis for setting benchmarks on sustainability in resource development in the Amur and EAO.  Health, Safety, Environmental and Community (HSEC) issues, both positive and negative, are being assessed for the proposed projects together with HSEC management issues associated with Aricoms current and future operations.  IFCs investment will be used primarily to finance further exploration activities, feasibility studies and other corporate initiatives.  This investment is expected to have beneficial results for local employment, livelihoods of surrounding communities and in promoting HSEC best practice in Far East Russia. However, the diverse and extensive nature of this exploration and mining investment program means that there are potentially significant impacts.Management of all these issues by Aricom has been assessed as consistent with international good practice and the IFC Policy & Performance Standards. Considerable material has already been publicly disclosed (see links within this document) but in any large mining investment project such as this there are still inherent risks associated with many facets of the operation and for these reasons it is considered that 60 days disclosure would be beneficial for further strengthening of relationships. The key environmental, social and occupational health & safety and community aspects and issues associated with this project include:Corporate level:- Health, Safety & Environmental (HSE) management; - Social Responsibility and Community Engagement;- S&E Assessment and HSE Permitting; and- Labor & working conditions.Project level: - Processing facilities: air emissions, dust control, chemicals management, water and effluent management including groundwater protection, solid waste management, hazardous materials handling and management as well as emergency response and pollution prevention & abatement;-  Mining activities: dust control, drainage, pit rehabilitation, land use and agriculture/reindeer development, occupational health and safety, visual impacts and mine safety;-  Infrastructure and associated facilities: footprint minimization, public safety, resource conservation, dust control and hazards management and mitigation of transportation risks;-  Surrounding communities: land acquisition, emergency preparedness & response, community health, safety & security, social/community development and sustainable local economic development; and -  Protection and conservation of biodiversity and cultural heritage.Future development projects may have impacts on biodiversity, human populations including indigenous people and/or cultural property  this will be assessed on a case by case basis for each proposed mine development. Documentation relating to SEA and community engagement and consultation will be done in line with PS requirements.In this context, IFCs due diligence findings and application of IFCs Policy on Environmental & Social Review Procedures to this suite of aspects and issues resulted in this project being classified as Category A.","","","","",25914,"","BA - Iron (Pellets, etc.)","","","",""

TTB School Facility,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Africa,Ghana,Ghana School Finance Facility,Regional Industry - MAS Africa,2007-04-02T04:00:00Z,2007-05-02T04:00:00Z,FI,Guarantee,"The proposed project is follow-on investment to provide local currency financing and technical assistance to private K-12 and vocational schools in Ghana.  IFC would provide risk participation of up to GHC22 billion ($2.4 million) to The Trust Bank (TTB, the Bank, or the company) on loans extended to eligible private schools.  These loans will be used to finance construction, purchase of educational materials, and other capital expenditures.  In parallel with the financing facility, a technical assistance program will be provided: 

- to strengthen schools' financial, management, and educational capacities;
- to improve the business environment for private education; and 
- to foster the development of an independent provider of educational services to private schools.

Currently, few local banks are lending to private primary, secondary and vocational schools, and those that do, generally lend for less than two years. Thus, even if schools are able to secure bank financing, the tenor of that financing is generally not long enough to support expansion or modernization projects. Such projects thus proceed in a piecemeal fashion, resulting in a great deal of inefficiency and lost potential revenue. Further, expansion by such means cannot keep pace with the huge growth in demand for private schooling. IFC's risk participation would be structured to encourage the Bank to extend maturities to 3-5 years, tenors more appropriate for financing capital investments. 

Despite the impressive growth of private schools in Ghana over the past 15 years, most remain fundamentally weak in their financial and managerial capacities, as well as in their ability to develop more effective educational delivery mechanisms. The majority of schools has minimal financial expertise, weak information systems, if any, and limited opportunities for teacher training and curriculum development. The technical assistance program designed in conjunction with the financing facility is intended to address many of these shortcomings for participating schools, and, in addition, to strengthen the environment for private school operators.","","","","","","The proposed project will have a strong development impact in helping to improve the educational quality and financial and managerial capacity of private K-12 schools in Ghana. In doing so, the project will widen access to much-needed quality education. Illiteracy in Ghana is still close to 40%, and government spending on basic education has not kept up with population growth. According to World Bank estimates, Ghana is unlikely to meet the Millennium Development Goal of universal primary completion by 2015 at current enrolment and spending rates. The poor quality of public education has given rise to enormous demand for private schools. This demand is currently unmet, in large part because schools have little access to affordable, long-term financing, and little training in financial management. This project will address both shortcomings. The project's technical assistance component will also help schools, by building their management capacity, to improve the quality of education provided, thus setting a standard for the private sector, where quality is highly variable and unregulated by the government. Finally, this project supports a successful and replicable model for reaching small education providers - which comprise the vast majority of private providers - throughout Africa (and other regions). Due to the success of this model, IFC continues to expand education financing to other African countries with similar markets and constraints.","","","","","This project has been classified as a Category FI project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

PLL proposes to:- expand the capacity of its existing LNG terminal at Dahej, in Gujarat, from the present 5 million tons per annum (MMTPA) to 10 MMTPA. PLLs LNG terminal at Dahej was conceptualized as a 5 MMTPA terminal (which was commissioned in April 2004) with provision for capacity expansion to 10 MMTPA; and - set up a new Greenfield 2.5 MMTPA LNG terminal (with provision for capacity expansion to 5 MMTPA) at Kochi, in Kerala, both in India. Review of this project consisted of appraising technical, environmental and social information submitted by the company. The appraisal team also interviewed Petronets corporate and plant level operations, environment, occupational health, safety, human resources and community relations professionals. The appraisal included a site visit to the companys existing terminal at Dahej and to the greenfield LNG terminal site at Kochi.PLL had carried out Comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessments (CEIAs) both for terrestrial and marine impacts for the Kochi Terminal and Dahej Expansion in July 1999 and in July 2000, respectively. The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), Government of India (GoI), prior to awarding clearance for the Dahej LNG terminal capacity expansion to 10 MMTPA, required PLL to update the CEIAs (both terrestrial and marine for Dahej terminal expansion), which was completed in April 2005. Both the original and the updated CEIAs were reviewed. Further, regulatory approval documents, EPC contract documents, HR manual and management system manuals, were also reviewed. The following potential environment, health and safety and social aspects of the project were analyzed:- environment and social assessment and corporate environmental, social, and health and safety management systems; - community consultation, disclosure and engagement;- labor and working conditions including management of occupational health and safety; - pollution prevention and abatement (including management of resources including energy, water, hazardous and other materials;- management of emissions, discharges, hazardous and other wastes;- biodiversity conservation including management of marine impacts;- management of community environment, health and safety impacts during construction and operation; and - land acquisition and involuntary resettlement on account of the project.","","","","","","","","","","","","The key social and environmental aspects that are/may be associated with the project relate to PLLs environment and social assessment and corporate environmental, social, and health and safety management systems and their implementation. For the two terminals, issues include:-  emissions to soil, air and water; - marine impacts on account of dredging and construction of jetty;- ambient air quality; - changed risk profile of the Cochin Port area and of the Dahej terminal, due to additional LNG storage/handling;- employee as also community environment, health and safety; - impact on marine environment; - right of use (ROU) acquisition for RLNG transmission line and the associated involuntary resettlement; and- labor working conditions. While the impacts are diverse, most are short term and reversible/mitigable. Since the greenfield Kochi terminal is proposed in the Cochin port area and Dahej terminal has been in operation at the same location, these are not unprecedented. The impacts are not likely to be large scale; barring involuntary resettlement associated with ROU acquisition for RLNG transmission pipeline for Kochi terminal, mostly will be limited to the project site; and likely to have limited impact on environmentally sensitive areas. Potential impacts during construction besides being mitigable are likely to be limited to project site and short term. Further, it is possible to readily design and implement engineering and management measures to mitigate adverse impacts due to: - emissions to soil, air and water;- management of hazardous materials and wastes; - changed risk profile of the terminal; - employee and community health and safety during construction and operations; - marine impacts;- labor and working conditions; and- involuntary resettlement.

(Petstar) will construct and operate a bottle-to-bottle plastic recycling facility that will convert post-consumer polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles into food-grade, recycled PET resin that will be sold to the Mexican soft-drinks bottling industry.  The plant will be located in Toluca, in the State of Mexico, and will have a production capacity of 20,000 tons per year.  The discarded PET bottles that the plant recycles will reduce the volume of municipal solid waste generated in Mexico and will reduce the consumption of virgin PET by bottle manufacturers.

Petstar's wholly owned subsidiary, Avangard Mexico S.A. de C.V. (Avangard), is the largest collector of post-consumer plastic in Mexico.  In 2006, it collected over 74,000 tonnes of PET.  Avangard sorts, bales and grinds the PET and currently exports most of its product to the U.S. and China.  It will exclusively supply the Petstar recycling facility.","","","","","","The project is expected to generate 63 locally filled jobs at the recycling facility and additional jobs will be created in Avangard's operations as its collection activities expand.  The project will also indirectly support Avangard's supply chain which the company estimates provides an income to approximately 25,000 people.  Avangard sources waste PET bottles from over 1,300 suppliers nationally and supply sites include waste separation centers, deposit centers, rural communities, schools and waste disposal sites.  At waste disposal sites individual garbage sorting and recycling workers (known in Mexico as 'pepenadores') labor in poor working conditions, very often as family units.  Petstar is developing a programmatic social engagement plan directly targeted at addressing this systemic issue, thereby reducing the incidence of harmful informal child labor within its supply chain. 

By converting waste drinking bottles into a usable, valuable manufacturing input, the project will support improved waste management in Mexico.  PET bottles are non-biodegradable, high-volume items that are causing an increasingly unsightly waste disposal problem throughout Mexico. By reducing the volume of waste entering landfills, PET recycling increases the life of existing sanitary landfills, supporting Mexico's limited waste management infrastructure. The project involves technology transfer of PET recycling equipment that is currently mainly used in developed countries and will provide a demonstration of a successful private sector recycling business in Mexico. 

As well as meeting market demand for a locally produced product, the recycling project will result in displacement of petroleum-based virgin raw materials that can be made available for other productive uses.  The project will also contribute to government tax revenues.","","","","","This is a Category B project because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

Creation of a new microfinance institution:  Banco Amigo is a newly-created microfinance institution, and while the State of Nuevo Loan has adequate banking services, Mexico has a great need for microfinance institutions to serve the poor and low income populations.  New, well-capitalized, microfinance banks should lead to an improved financial infrastructure.  

- Scaling up microfinance:  

This project involves scaling up a greenfield microfinance institution by providing it with the necessary equity and debt funding to become profitable and expand operations.  If successful, it is expected that this model could be replicated in other countries. 

- Contribution to Poverty Reduction: 

Extension of finance to previously underserved groups: Small and micro businesses across continents lack adequate sources of funding. IFC's investment will result in increasing the availability of financial services to this large, underserved group. Supporting productive small businesses should then stimulate growth, generate employment and reduce poverty.","","","","","This project involves IFC support for the business of microfinance and has been classified as a Category FI project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

The companies have thus far generated all of their electricity requirements from their own generation facilities.  However, in order to meet accelerated growth in peak demand, the companies plan to interconnect to a power plant of their sister company, EGE Haina, to benefit from its more cost-competitive electricity.  EGE Haina is the largest generator in the country, which is majority owned and controlled by the sponsors of CEPM.The proposed IFC investment, a corporate loan of $20 million to CEPM and CEB, will finance part of the construction of a 129 km transmission line with 100MW capacity, including three sub-stations.  The transmission line will be off-grid and dedicated to transfer electricity from the EGE Haina power plant in San Pedro Macoris through CEB in Bayahibe to CEPM in Punta Cana.  Total project costs are estimated at $35 million.  ELECNOR of Spain will construct the transmission line, while ABB from Switzerland will be responsible for the substations.

Such transactions help improve the stability of  the banking system by encouraging transparency in balance sheets as true value of assets is exposed by the market value paid by buyers of NPLs and financial institutions are obligated to take losses and contribute additional capital where necessary.  This helps the banking system achieve a capital adequacy level that is more consistent with the actual risks in bank portfolios.  In addition the systematic and vigorous pursuit of NPLs contributes to the development of a much better credit culture especially in countries where the willingness to repay (as opposed to the ability to repay) has been the cause of serious portfolio problems in the banking systems which have had to be resolved at an enormous fiscal cost.

Housing Development Finance Corporation Plc. - Maldives,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Active,South Asia,Maldives,HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION PLC,"Global Industry, Financial Markets",2007-05-04T04:00:00Z,2007-06-07T04:00:00Z,C,Loan,"The project entails the privatization of Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited (HDFCL or the company) in the Republic of Maldives, which is currently 100% owned by the Government of Maldives (GoM). IFC intend to invest up to $1.8 million as equity of up to 15% stake, in, along with up to $10 million of long term debt to support the growth of the privatized company.  After privatization, the government ownership in the company would be reduced to 40% or below. The investment would be supplemented by an IFC Advisory Services package to assist HDFCLs smooth transition from a government owned company to a private-sector firm. Housing Development Finance company of India (HDFC) and Asian Development Bank (ADB) are also invited to participate in this privatization project. As part of the privatization program, the GoM has also planned to list the company on the Maldives stock exchange.The Maldives, with a population of about 300,000, is an island nation consisting of 20 atolls which encompass a territory of about 1200 islands stretching over of an area of 90,000 sq km in the Indian Ocean. About 200 islands are inhabited by local communities. After the 2004 December tsunami, the population on Male, the Capital island with a land area of 1.9 sq km, has surged from below 80,000 to over 110,000, putting an immense pressure on the existing 8,000 housing units. With 58,000 inhabitants per sq km on the Island and an average of 14 inhabitants per dwelling unit, Male is undoubtedly one of the most densely populated and congested places on earth. To ease the housing shortage and reduce the congestion in Male, the GoM has reclaimed an island, Hulhumale, about 2 km from Male, and planned to build as many as 8,000 new housing units and commercial facilities there. HDFCL, the first and only housing finance company, was established by the GoM in 2004 to provide long-term loans to residents who are eager to migrate to the new island. However, despite the demand for housing finance, the company has not been able to extend any new loans over the last year due to funding constraints. The company had run out of the initial equity funding invested by the government, and had not been able to borrow from commercial sources without the full government guarantee. The GoM, for prudent fiscal reasons, has decided not to continue the practices of providing credit guarantees to the company. After a period of hiatus, the GoM has invited IFC, ADB, and HDFC of India, to help privatize the company, and to list the company on the local stock exchange.","","","","","","The development impact of this project would be:- Development of commercially viable, long-term sustainable housing finance market in Maldives:The company extends housing finance, and therefore offers an opportunity of home ownership for middle and lower-income borrowers on a commercially viable, long-term sustainable basis. While HDFCL had been a significant source for housing finance in the country; in the absence of long term debt/equity financing, it is unable to meet the existing demand from creditworthy clients.  The project will help jump start the housing finance market to assist a majority of the population in the country to obtain housing finance to realize their dreams of owning their homes.- Privatization and institution-building of the countrys first private-sector housing finance company:HDFCL has not been able to develop its business and provide relief to the severe housing shortage in the country. It ceased operations due to lack of access long-term commercial funds and more fundamentally, due to its complete reliance on government guarantees which could not be sustained. A successfully privatized company, operating along the principles of being commercially viable and long-term sustainable, would generate great and sustained relief to the housing shortage situations in the country, improve the quality of life for many citizens, and contribute to creation of a vibrant financial sector of the country. - Development of housing related SME/supply industries: Through extensive linkage effects, the housing industry will contribute to the development of SMEs that supply labor and materials for the construction and improvement of homes, since most of the construction activity is conducted through contractors and the informal sector. Sufficient demand for the supplies provided by the informal sector would prompt development of such segments in the economy into more formal and better managed companies leading to a more professional construction sector.- Support the development of a new urban center: GoMs investment in Hulhumale and its efforts to spread the capital island thereby easing the pressure on Male, has not succeeded so far. This has primarily been due to the lack of housing finance for individuals, which has led to less than 5% of Hulhumale island being built and occupied as of date. Supporting HDFCL would allow for further development of Hulhumale by facilitating migration to the Hulhumale, creating economic opportunities in the newly developed projects and by extension, improve living conditions in Male.","","","","",This project is engaged in the business of mortgage finance and has been classified as a Category C project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

- an IFC investment of up to ZAR125 million ($16 million equivalent) through a collateralized mortgage finance warehousing line to TUHF (Pty) Limited (TUHF Pty or the company); and
- an equity investment of up 10 percent in the company.

The company will be newly incorporated as a private sector firm, assuming the key business operations that are currently performed by Trust for Urban Housing Finance, a section 21 company duly registered under the Companies Act in South Africa (TUHF Section 21).  Section 21 companies in South Africa are incorporated as 'not-for-profit' firms.  

TUHF Section 21 is a financing organization that provides: 

- funding to entrepreneurs for the purposes of purchasing and rehabilitating dilapidated multi-family rental buildings in the inner city of Johannesburg; and 
- extending long-term mortgage loans to these property owners once the acquisition and rehabilitation process has been completed. 

These property owners (landlords) rely on revenues generated from their rent-rolls to make mortgage payments on the property.  Over the years, TUHF Section 21 has built a working business model focused on inner city mortgage loan origination, and the outstanding portfolio currently stands at ZAR250 million ($33 million equivalent), with another ZAR400 million ($53 million equivalent) in commitments to be funded. 

The management of TUHF Section 21 embarked on a program to rationalize its funding structure due to growth in its operations. This growth has prompted the need for a restructuring of TUHF Section 21 operations, and led to a proposal for the establishment of TUHF Pty.  This conversion will ensure that the business model can be placed on a firmer financing footing by restructuring its sources of funding, thereby lowering the cost of funding and enabling operations to be further scaled up using a corporate structure that is driven by a profit motive.  At the same time, the business model will retain its developmental mandate of inner city rejuvenation.

The management is currently in the process of putting together a ZAR1.075 billion ($143 million equivalent) comprehensive funding program (Total Funding Program) for TUHF Pty.  This Funding Program will comprise:

- ZAR250 million ($33 million equivalent) warehousing line (of which IFC will participate up to 50 percent and Standard Bank of South Africa will provide the balance);
- ZAR825 million ($110 million equivalent) mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issue, broken down into three pieces as follows:

- ZAR450 million ($60 million equivalent) Class A notes;
- ZAR300 million ($40 million equivalent) Class B notes; and 
- ZAR75 million ($10 million equivalent) Class C notes, which can be substituted with an equity investment in TUHF Pty.

The MBS issue will be a securitization of the current and future mortgage loan book.  A group of Investors interested in the three classes of notes have expressed their interests in the debt offering to the Company.  They include Future Growth Asset Managers, Standard Bank of South Africa, Development Bank of South Africa and National Housing Finance Corporation.  All these entities, except Future Growth, are already lenders to TUHF Section 21 and will essentially swap their outstanding loans for the proposed notes.","","","","","","- Households:

Enhance access to housing by increasing supply and making property more affordable to low and middle income households in South Africa, especially through the rental and rent-to-buy schemes; 

- Environment/Communities: 

Provide value added products and services to underserved markets.  Improve living standards generally and environmental sustainability by investing in residential refurbished, renewed and enhanced residential properties.  Such investment provides social and financial upliftment in inner-city of Johannesburg by reversing the cycles of disinvestment and abandonment -- the positive aspect of contagion effects.

- Financial Sector (Banks, Investors):  

Support the development of financial markets by improving the quality and quantity of the housing stock, which will help create important downstream effects on the mortgage/housing finance markets; bolster housing finance markets by providing a demonstration effect to other players as it showcases the commercial viability of this business.

- Related Businesses: 

During construction, provide contracts to construction businesses as well as sub-contractors and service providers, especially SMEs. As consumers purchase and/or occupy their homes, generate increased demand for goods and services supplied by local businesses, and provide opportunities for Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) policy by supporting emerging entrepreneurs. 

- Local Employment:

Create jobs in housing-related industries  contracting and sub-contracting, surveying, construction, interior design, and other complementary industries and service providers. 

- Economy: 

Contribute to the creation of viable and sustainable residential (housing) property markets, which have a powerful influence on a broad range of socio-economic conditions (High income countries use housing statistics as an economic barometer).","","","","","This project has provisionally been classified as a Category FI project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

As one of the founders, ICHUT itself was formed as an NGO ten years ago, and coupling with its two new partners, transferred its loan book and retained earnings to the newly formed entity.  At inception, TUHF Section 21 was the beneficiary of a capital base of approximately ZAR11 million ($1.6 million).  TUHF section 21's Board of Directors is drawn from its founding institutions as well as community associations such as the Banking Association of South Africa and the Johannesburg Housing Company. 

Although it has a national mandate, so far TUHF Section 21's initial focus has been on redlined areas of the Johannesburg city centre.  TUHF Section 21 chose this starting point for two reasons.  Firstly, as the successor to ICHUT, TUHF Section 21 could build on ICHUT's ten years of experience in lending to tenant-based and small private landlords in the Johannesburg inner city.  Secondly, the experience of TUHF Section 21's staff and its Board of Directors was centered on Johannesburg.","The total project cost is estimated at ZAR1.075 billion ($143 million equivalent).

Melrose has a balanced portfolio of producing assets, development projects and exploration interests.  The company holds a 100% interest in the Bulgarian Galata field through its wholly owned subsidiaries Melrose Resources Sarl and Petreco Bulgaria EOOD, and is also exploring in four adjacent offshore exploration concessions.   In Egypt, Melrose currently has 100% interest in the Qantara, El Mansoura and South East El Mansoura concessions, all located in the onshore Nile Delta.

The company is planning to support the additional capital expenditure program over the next few years by increasing its current debt facilities, committed in November 2006, by $85 million.","","","","","","Fit with World Bank Group Strategy In Egypt the World Bank Group (WBG) Strategy is to:- facilitate private sector development; - enhance the provision of selected public goods; and - promote social and economic equity.  IFCs strategic objective outlined in the WBG strategy is to focus on: - supporting PPI initiatives, - assisting the development of new financial sector institutions and instruments for the private sector,- catalyzing new private sector investment in manufacturing, petrochemicals, oil and gas, as well as the social sectors, and - supporting SME initiatives.In Bulgaria the objectives of WBG are to:- address productivity and employment; - implement fiscal sustainability and proper absorption of EU funds; and - target poverty reduction through social inclusion.  IFCs strategic objective outlined in the WBG strategy is to support Bulgarias EU integration by helping Bulgaria improve its competitiveness through supporting domestic companies and attracting foreign private investors in the country.  The proposed project is consistent with WBGs overall strategic priorities in these countries by developing its natural resources, attracting foreign investment and providing training and jobs, while helping the company to operate in an environmentally and socially responsible manner.Development ImpactThe project is expected to contribute to the benefits provided by Melroses continued operations as follows:- Promoting Natural Gas Development and Use:  The project will contribute to increased natural gas production in Egypt; production is expected to increase from an average 70 mmcf/d in 2005 to 200mmcf/d by year-end 2007.  Natural gas is believed to be the primary growth driver in the Egyptian energy sector.  Melroses operations support both the development of gas for domestic use and the governments strategy of promoting gas as a domestic fuel of choice.  Bulgaria has limited indigenous gas production and its domestic market for natural gas is still at an early stage of development.  The Galata field development, the first upstream oil and gas development undertaken by the private sector in Bulgaria, has supported the governments objectives to include the private sector and develop a competitive gas market.  In 2005, the company provided 16% of the natural gas consumed domestically.  The Project will contribute to sustaining this positive impact on the countrys gas sector.  Moreover, it is expected that the Galata field, upon depletion, will be used as a gas storage facility, thus strengthening Bulgaria''s role as a gas transit country with its corresponding revenue generating benefits.- Creation and Preservation of Direct and Indirect Employment:   The project will help sustain employment in both countries.  In Egypt, the operating company currently employs approximately 500 personnel and contractors, of which more than 95% are locals.  In addition, given the large development program envisioned over the next couple of years, the project is expected generate additional employment of about 200/300 contractors per annum.  In its Bulgarian operations, Melrose employs 43 people directly. Over 95% employees are locals. - Supporting Local Communities and Suppliers:  The company is committed to the local communities in which it operates, recognizing that engagement with the communities in the area of its operations is integral to the long-term success of its investments.  In Egypt, Melrose and its partner Merlon have contributed to schools, mosques and the construction of roads and other infrastructure within the concession areas.  In Bulgaria, the Company sponsors a daycare center for children with disabilities by providing heating fuel during the winter months and is presently rebuilding a local church.   In addition, with the exception of specialized equipment Melrose aims to procure approximately 70% and 70% of its purchases locally in Egypt and Bulgaria, respectively.  - Benefits to Government: The project benefits to Egypt and Bulgaria include continued revenues that will accrue to these governments in the form of production share, royalties and corporate taxes.  The estimated net present value of future aggregate revenues to the Government of Egypt (GoE) and Government of Bulgaria (GoB) is expected to be about $300 million and $5million, respectively, over the life of the proposed IFC investment, representing less than 0.09% and 0.01% of annual federal government revenues. (nb 2005 revenues - $9.9bn Bulgaria & $32.9bn Egypt)IFC plans to monitor the following development impacts for both Bulgaria and Egypt during the life of the IFC investment: - employment levels; - local/national purchasing; - production sharing and fiscal payments accruing to the governments of Egypt and Bulgaria; and - investments in community programs.","","The benefits of the project come in a number of forms as outlined above, including revenues to the governments in the form of taxes, royalties and other payments. In the case of Egypt, the governments share of hydrocarbon revenues partly accrues to the Ministry of Petroleum (EGPC/GPC), and for income taxes to the Ministry of Finance (MOF).  In Bulgaria, revenues accrue to the municipality of Varna and to the central government.  In coming to a view of whether to support this project, the IFC considered the value of the projects benefits, and governance and other risks to these benefits. In this respect it considered a range of indicators of governance, as well as the current relationship between the host countries and the World Bank Group. These indicators reveal a mixed picture in the case of Egypt, and an improving situation in the case of Bulgaria. The World Bank is currently engaged with the Egyptian Government on governance-related initiatives, including the introduction of performance monitoring and evaluation frameworks, and requiring a higher level of information disclosure to the public. In Bulgaria, governance and the strengthening of institutions are at the forefront of the governments policies. The World Bank is involved with the Bulgarian Government to further strengthen public administration capacity, improve the quality of service delivery, reduce corruption, strengthen accountability and transparency, and, importantly, increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the judicial system. To ensure transparency Melrose has agreed to publicly disclose all revenues paid to government authorities on an annual basis.","","","This is a Category B project because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines and the corrective action plan.At the parent company, Melrose has committed to develop and implement an integrated Health, Safety, Environment and Corporate Social Responsibility Management System (HSEMS).

The Facility will involve dedicating an experienced group of professionals who would have a hands-on approach by actively participating in the early stage project development efforts, which would be partially funded through the Facility.  IFC would, therefore, act as co-developer and provide expertise in critical areas of the project development work.  In this respect, the Facility would be an additional tool available to IFC to address a key constraint to private sector participation in frontier countries/sectors, namely the unavailability of sufficient funds and experienced professionals dedicated to infrastructure projects.  Target projects would include: - private infrastructure projects at an early stage of development where the sponsor has some form of agreement with the host Government; - projects that are in the process of being tendered, where IFC would support the prospective investors on a non-exclusive basis during the selection process, to help ensure that the resulting project is bankable, and to help the winning sponsor finalize the development of the project and bring it to financial close; - early stage private infrastructure projects which do not require a contractual relationship with the host Government (captive plants, logistics, shipping, etc.); and - post-conflict country initiatives. Request for IFCs involvement could come either from private companies or from Governments.The Facility will provide risk capital to fund early stages of development of infrastructure projects.  Eligible costs to be funded by the Facility would include: - consultant expenses and fees; - planning and feasibility studies, such as environmental and social assessments and related community engagement activities; - early project development costs, such as permits, land acquisition, prototypes and pilot studies; and - other project development expenses, as deemed appropriate.","","","","","","The Facility addresses the on-going demand from Government and private investors to receive support from the World Bank Group in the development of an increased pipeline of bankable private and PPP projects.

BRAC PCG,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,South Asia,Bangladesh,BANGLADESH RURAL ADVANCEMENT COMMITTEE,"Global Industry, Financial Markets",2007-05-17T04:00:00Z,2007-06-18T04:00:00Z,FI,Guarantee,"Bangladesh is considered the pioneer of microfinance and has the worlds largest microfinance sector. However, despite the prevalence of close to 1,200 NGOs with microcredit services operating in more than 40,000 villages in Bangladesh, Bangladesh continues to remain one of the worlds poorest nations. Poverty is pervasive in the country with almost half the population living below the poverty line on less than $1 per day. BRAC is one of the largest microfinance institutions in Bangladesh, covering all 64 districts and a population of a 100 million (of the total population of 140 million) through its microfinance and development programs. It was started in 1972 by Mr. Abed to rehabilitate returning refugees after the liberation War in a remote area in a northeastern district of Bangladesh. As of December 31, 2006, BRAC had cumulative microfinance loan disbursements of $3.72 billion, with outstanding loans of $349.72 million to 4.55 million borrowers. To finance the growth of its microfinance operations, BRAC needs local currency financing from domestic banks.  Due to single client exposure limits and small size of such local banks, relative to the financing required, the local banks are not able to satisfy the funding needs of large institutions like BRAC. To address such constraint, IFC is proposing an $18 million partial credit guarantee issued on a $22 million local currency loan extended by Citibank, Dhaka to BRAC (BRAC or the company). IFCs partial credit guarantee would provide 81.82% coverage to Citibanks local currency loan of US$22 million loan. The project would support BRACs expansion of its microfinance lending to reach out to the poor, which continues to be underserved by the financial sector in the country.","","","","","","The project is expected to have a significant development impact: - Expanding Sources of Local Currency Funds:The project will be an example of a viable way for an MFI to access local currency funding on commercial basis and reduce reliance on aid and donor funding. - Expand Access to Finance: The additional loan amount enabled by the IFC PCG of about US$18 million would enable BRAC to finance nearly 103,000 new loans on annual basis. Assuming such loans have an average maturity of one year, then IFCs PCG would finance nearly 515,000 loans over the life of the PCG (5 years).  - Demonstration Effect: At the more strategic level, this project can have a strong demonstration effect by effectively showing that microfinance institutions, if well managed, can constitute very attractive investment propositions for commercially oriented investors. This, in turn, will support the emerging trend of private capital flows to microfinance institutions, an important source of capital for the long-term viability of this industry. The current guarantee structure would allow Citibank to extend local currency funds without breaching its single exposure limits. - Significant direct contribution to poverty reduction:Over the past two decades, leading microfinance operators have convincingly demonstrated that well-managed MFIs can make major contributions to poverty reduction and employment creation in developing countries. In recognition of this strong developmental impact, almost all multilateral and bilateral institutions and donor agencies are actively promoting microfinance, and increasingly focusing on supporting MFIs. Supporting productive small businesses will in turn stimulate growth, employment generation and poverty reduction. The proposed investment is expected to contribute to employment creation and poverty reduction in the target regions.","","","","","This project involves IFC support for the business of microfinance and has been classified as a Category FI project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

Lydians Health, Safety, Environment, Community and Labor (HSEC/L) management, organization and systems for the Draznja project in Kosovo were discussed extensively as it is the most advanced project. These discussions included staffing requirements for Lydians HSEC/L functions, and the development of adequate environmental, safety and social management capacity at the corporate level in the medium term when mine development occurs.  Information and other documents related to management of environmental, social and labor issues at Armulsar and Muratdag were also discussed.

PAE is the second largest oil and gas producer in Argentina and has blocks located in the four major hydrocarbon basins - Golfo San Jorge, Austral, Neuquina and Northwest.  The most significant block in terms of both reserves and production is the Cerro Dragon block in the Golfo San Jorge basin, located in the South of Argentina.  The company holds interests in 10 oil and gas production blocks in Argentina and 13 oil and gas production and development blocks in Bolivia, twelve of which are held through its indirect Bolivian subsidiary, Empresa Petrolera Chaco S.A.

The project comprises an oil and gas drilling program, completion of water-flooding projects, and the construction of necessary facilities to support the increase in production.","","","","",""," - Fit with World Bank Group Strategy:The World Bank Groups (WBG) current program in Argentina focuses on sustained growth, coupled with enhanced equity, social inclusion and improved governance.  IFCs priorities for its direct investments is to provide long-term financing and structured finance products to companies and projects in strategic sectors with a focus on groups expanding on a South-South basis and export-oriented or export facilitating projects.  Strategic focus sectors are oil, gas, mining, agribusiness, and the financial sector.  The proposed IFC investment is fully consistent with this strategy. - Development Impact:Contribution to Alleviate Tight Gas Market in Argentina:Gas demand growth outpaced gas supply in recent years in Argentina.  The gap has been driven on the one hand by the sustained economic expansion experienced in recent years, fuelled mainly by the growth in the industrial sector and increased use of CNG in vehicles, and further enhanced by the distortion of energy prices, and, on the other, by the investment lag in developing gas reserves as a result of the new context.  PAE is one of the few companies in Argentina that has grown its gas reserves and production during the last five years.  Today, gas represents over 50% of the companys proven reserves.  Part of the 2007 investment in the project will go toward increasing gas production, which will help alleviate the current gas shortage in Argentina.  Creation/Preservation of Employment:PAE is a key employer in the regions where it operates, especially in the Golfo San Jorge basin where it employs 575 direct staff and almost 6,400 contractors.  The IFC investment will contribute to the companys growth, which has lead to an average of 100 new direct jobs created per annum since 2003. In addition, the investment will help maintain employment levels on a company-wide basis in the provinces of Chubut and Santa Cruz, where the oil and gas industry offers significant employment opportunities.Local Purchasing and Development of SMEsPAE procures most of its goods and services in Argentina from over 1,500 suppliers and contractors. In 2006, PAE spent approximately $728 million on Argentine investments, goods and services.  PAEs efforts to develop Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the Golfo San Jorge area help maximize the impact of this local purchasing.  This PAE corporate program launched in 2005 has as its objective the promotion of sustainable economic development through supplier development, government capacity building, and access to finance.Support for Local Communities:PAE has developed a strong positive relationship with the local communities in each of its areas of operation.  Its commitment to sustainable community development is exemplified through the companys support for numerous social development activities focused on the key areas of education, health, employment and environment.  PAE has also engaged with a number of NGOs to identify opportunities for additional social investment and enjoys broad community support throughout its operations.Benefits to Government:PAE contributes significant fiscal revenues to all levels of government.  During 2006, PAE made an estimated $1 billion in payments to various levels of government consisting of income taxes, royalties, export tariffs and other taxes.  The company submits on a quarterly basis financial statements as part of its obligations to Argentinas National Securities Commission, and such disclosures are available publicly.  PAE is expected to remain a significant contributor of tax revenues for both the federal and regional budgets and is also expected to continue contributing to Argentinas foreign currency earnings and over the life of the IFC loans.Indicators to monitor development impact include: - gas production, - payments to government, - employment maintained/created, - purchases from local and national suppliers, and - investment in social and community development.","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result, which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

In addition, Maples proposed investments may potentially lead to new hydrocarbon discoveries. - Creation of Markets and Production of Renewable Bio-fuels:Maples entry into the production of bio-ethanol using locally harvested sugar cane grown on its own land using state-of-the-art irrigation drip systems will boost the agricultural sector in Piura, promote the use of efficient irrigation technology in the Chira river basin, and produce a renewable, less polluting indigenous fuel.  Maples ethanol production will allow for exports to international markets and will also be available for mixing with domestic gasoline which is expected to become mandatory in Peru in 2010. - Contribution to Peruvian Government Revenue:The project facilitates the production and sale of hydrocarbons and ethanol which provides an important source of revenue to the country through both upstream royalties and corporate income taxes. - Creating Local Employment and Sourcing in Peru:Maples various operations currently directly employ approximately 400 people in Peru. The planned upstream activities are expected to provide additional employment opportunities and exposure to skilled employment to Peruvians. In addition, Maples new ethanol venture will create direct new employment opportunities in Peru associated with the cultivation and subsequent harvesting of land to be planted with cane and the construction and operation of an industrial ethanol distillery.

In coming to a view of whether to support this project, IFC considered the value of the projects benefits, and governance and other risks to these benefits.  In this respect, it has reviewed a range of assessments including, but not limited to, the World Bank Institutes Governance Indicators and Transparency Internationals Corruption Perceptions Index.  Also taken into account is Perus current engagement with the World Bank Group and the IMF.  At the national level, Peru has already achieved a relatively high standard on accountability and transparency in the collection and distribution of oil, gas and mining revenues. This effort is part of a broader process of fiscal decentralization; it builds upon existing legislation regarding access to information and is consistent with Perus commitment to the G8 Transparency Compact.  The government, through the Minister of Energy and Mines, has subscribed to the EITI and appointed an EITI coordinator.

Latin American Challenge Investment Fund II,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Pending Approval,Latin America and the Caribbean,Latin America Region,Latin American Challenge Investment Fund II,Regional Industry - FIG LAC,2007-06-06T04:00:00Z,2007-08-16T04:00:00Z,FI,Guarantee,"The project proposes to build on LA-CIF's excellent 7-year track record in Latin American microfinance by creating a multi-currency capital structure to provide local currency resources to MFIs and also to attract local investors. The project falls directly under IFC's priority to boost both investment volume and development impact, which is through promoting collective investment vehicles. IFC's participation in this project will lead to a pioneer bond issue through a strategic partner which will issue PEN and MXN denominated bonds to Mexican and Peruvian private investors. The project will be executed in close collaboration with IFC's Treasury Department.

The primary goal is to demonstrate that well managed Latin American MFIs can access private sources of capital and attract sophisticated investors. LA-CIF II's objectives are to: 

- structure and mobilize additional local currency financial resources for MFIs; 
- attract large local pension funds and banks to the microfinance sector; 
- generate adequate returns for investors;
- diversify risk sharing among a larger number of investors and investees; and 
- manage a regional portfolio of up to 23-25 MFIs.","","","","","","- Significant Direct Contribution to Poverty Reduction: 

The project will extend finance through MFIs to previously underserved groups: micro and small businesses that lack adequate sources of funding. IFC's new investment will increase the availability of financial services to this large underserved group. Supporting productive small businesses will in turn stimulate growth, employment generation and poverty reduction.

- Scaling Up Microfinance: 

By supporting an institution sponsored by LA-CIF II, this project will help scale up 23-25 microfinance institutions operating in Latin America by providing them with commercial funding in order to expand operations. This model should attract other private and commercial investors to do the same, thereby promoting investments in the microfinance sector. The project will also help address the mismatch of assets and liabilities on the books of MFIs (foreign exchange risk).

- Demonstration Effect:

The integration of local private investors (private banks and pension funds) into microfinance will be one of the first of its kind. This will show the way for other sophisticated institutional investors to enter the sector and deepen local financial markets. In addition, the transaction is also expected to facilitate a flagship bond issue that will be offering a PEN bond instrument to local Mexican and Peruvian investors for the first time. This could lead to replication in other countries and regions.

- Facilitate the Access of MFIs to Local Currency/Commercial Funding:  

The current demand of credit by underserved micro enterprises in emerging markets far exceeds the funding provided by donors and commercial lenders.  In order to satisfy the demand and unleash the productive capacity of these micro enterprises, MFIs need to tap into commercial funding sources to support their expansion.  The Fund enables MFIs to access capital from financial markets in local currency, which strengthens their balance sheets.  The demonstration effect and the experience to be gained by commercial and institutional investors in the MFI sector is expected to result in sustainable, commercial funding relationships.","","","","","This project involves IFC support for the business of microfinance, and has been classified as a Category FI project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

(Tecon Salvador or the company), a container terminal located in the Port of Salvador, in the state of Bahia in North East Brazil. The Port of Salvador comprises 9 berths, of which two are leased to Tecon Salvador, and seven remain under public ownership. It is the largest port in the North East region. Tecon Salvador serves a regional, export-orientated market, mainly concentrated in Bahia. 

IFC made an initial investment in the company in 2001, when Tecon Salvador was awarded the right to operate the terminal under a 25 year concession.  

The proposed new financing will support Tecon Salvador's capital expenditure plans for 2007 and 2008, the most important aspect of which is the purchase of equipment, and accompanying civil works, required in order to optimize operations.","","","","","","The incremental development impacts of the proposed project will stem from Tecon Salvador's ability to increase its operational efficiency, thereby enabling it to respond to strong regional demand, which to date has exceeded its capacity, given its current equipment and facilities.  

It is expected that follow-on development impacts will include:

- reducing transport costs versus the counter-factual of operational inefficiencies; 
- incremental increases in market access for both importers and exporters, and thus consumers and producers in the Bahia region; 
- increasing container volumes and containerization rates; 
- expansion of services offered by shipping lines in the North East, which will benefit from increased terminal efficiency; 
- increasing demand for inputs from local suppliers; 
- an incremental increase in jobs as Tecon Salvador is able to expand; and 
- increasing payments to government in terms of concession payments and taxes.

As a result of these impacts, Tecon Salvador will help to multiply the benefits of the region's export growth, and strengthen Bahia as an investment destination.","","","","","IFCs ongoing review and supervision of the existing investment in Tecon Salvador have shown the company is continuing to meet its environmental, health and safety, and social compliance obligations, including the applicable and relevant IFC policies and guidelines.

Galnaftogaz Expansion Phase II,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,Ukraine,"CONCERN GALNAFTOGAZ, JSC","Gbl Ind, Manufact, Agribus & Services",2007-07-13T04:00:00Z,2007-08-23T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"Open Joint Stock Company Concern Galnaftogaz (GNG or the company), an existing IFC client, is the largest independent (not tied to a refinery) operator of gas filling stations in Ukraine.  Galnaftogaz's main business is distribution of petroleum products mainly gasoline and diesel through its network of filling stations and direct sale in the wholesale market.  GNG currently operates 15 storage terminals and about 206 stations, including 163 OKKO branded stations.  OKKO stations are high throughput and modern format gas stations which offer high quality fuel and a variety of related products and services (convenience store, car wash, auto repair, and fast food services).  GNG had sales of $515.9 million and EBITDA of $24.7 million in 2006 and was ranked fourth in Ukraine by number of stations and third by sales volume.

GNG requested IFC for financing package of $100 million ($50 million on IFC's own account and $50 million on account of participant banks) to fund the second phase of its expansion with estimated capital expenditures of $642 million over the next 4 years.  The expansion aims to increase the company's petroleum distribution network to about 358 OKKO stations through acquisitions of 170 stations and construction/upgrading of 188 stations (currently GNG operates 43 unbranded stations most of which will be converted, while the remainder will be sold or closed).  Besides the stations, the project involves investments in supporting infrastructure (storage terminals, petroleum trucks, acquisition of land under existing stations, etc.).","","","","","","- Development Impact

Access to high-quality petroleum products and services: 

The core of GNG's business strategy is providing high-quality petroleum products and ancillary products/services to its customers.  By expanding further in western Ukraine and entering in the eastern regions, Galnaftogaz will provide access to such services to its new customers and at the same time will lift the standards for other market players.

Economies of Scale and Competition: 

The project will enable GNG to gain greater economies of scale and improve its operating efficiencies.  Ultimately, the economies of scale and GNG's independence from any single refinery will lead to increased competition in the petroleum retail sector.

Employment: 

For each station put into operation, GNG will employ and train on average 8-12 Ukrainians depending on the type of station.  The jobs on full time and part time basis would become available to nearby population, including women, retirees, and students.  220 additional stations will result in creation/preservation of about 1,760-2,640 jobs.

Temporary and indirect employment: 

The project will on temporary basis create construction jobs as 1 station requires an estimated of 5,600 man-hours to build.  The project in total will create about 725 thousand man-hours of construction employment.  It is also likely to generate further positive downstream impacts through development of small entrepreneurs through outsourcing of supplies and services.

The key development indicators that are proposed to be monitored during the life of the IFC investment are:

- Direct employment (including % of women)
- Aggregate indirect employment during construction (in man-hours)
- Number of stations per region (OKKO and non-branded)
- Taxes to Government

Fit With World Bank Group Strategy:

The World Bank Group's 2004-07 CAS for Ukraine has seven objectives: 
- sustainable economic growth; 
- poverty reduction and the strengthening of the middle class; 
- comprehensive and harmonized human development; 
-  environmental sustainability;
- gradual integration into the world economic and financial systems; 
- reduction of regional imbalances; and 
- improvement of state administration.

IFC's role in this strategy is to strengthen private sector development to contribute to these objectives.  IFC is responding to recent improvements in economic management and legislation by stepping up its business development efforts, with an increasing focus on local companies both in the financial and real sectors.  In addition, IFC is continuing its large and very effective technical assistance program, which has been directed to improve the business environment, as well as to provide hands-on support to small and medium enterprises and farms.  The proposed investment fits well with the World Bank Group strategy for Ukraine.","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review procedures because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

Since 2001, the company was able to establish 200 service stations in Western and Central Ukraine with sales of over $515.9 million equivalent in 2006.  The company has developed a premium brand named OKKO which was applied to its modern stations known for high-quality petroleum products, convenience stores, and auto services; 176 of GNG's 219 stations operate under OKKO brand.  To support the operation of station by ensuring uninterrupted inventory supply, GNG owns 15 tank storage facilities (9 facilities are used and 6 are not utilized) and a tanker-car fleet with total capacity of 1,232 tons (1,541 thousand liters).

As GNG's business increased, the company's shareholders strived to transform GNG into a transparent and professionally managed business.  IFC's involvement with Galnaftogaz originated from the work performed by PEP Ukraine Corporate Development Project (UCDP).  As the result of Galnaftogaz's work with UCDP to establish better governance and increase transparency and disclosure, GNG was among first companies in Ukraine to develop and adopt a corporate governance code.  According to a study performed by Concorde Capital, one of the leading Ukrainian investment banks, GNG was ranked first among Ukrainian businesses in terms of corporate governance (February 6, 2007).

The members of the Supervisory Board, executive directors, and related family members directly control 80% of the voting shares of the Company, institutional investors, and fund hold circa 18%, and the balance by individuals.  The ultimate controlling party of the group is Mr. Vitaliy Antonov (the sponsor), a reputable Ukrainian businessperson. 

Mr. Antonov also owns other businesses in Ukraine of which the most notable are Universalna Insurance Company (non-life and life insurance), Khlibprom (vertically integrated bread/pastry/confectionary producer), and Vash Dim (construction company).

Its contracting partner for all the concessions is China United Coalbed Methane Co. Ltd. (CUCBM), the state-owned entity responsible for foreign CBM development in the country.","","","","","","China recently overtook the United States as the world's biggest producer of carbon dioxide.  The environmental and associated health impacts of a principally coal fired economy are of increasing concern, and development of local natural gas resources, including CBM, can be part of the solution to alleviate these problems.  Compared to coal-fired electricity, natural gas use produces virtually no emissions of sulfur dioxide, mercury or particulate matter, 80% less NOx, and approximately 50 percent less CO2.  Increasing the use of natural gas helps reduce acid rain, smog, regional haze, and their associated health impacts, including asthma attacks, cardiac problems and upper and lower respiratory ailments. 

China is the world's second largest consumer of oil after the U.S. and the third largest net importer of oil after the U.S. and Japan.  The development of a local energy source can help alleviate concerns of energy security.  Furthermore, the government will reap benefits from fiscal revenues, royalties, and taxes.

The government of China is taking measures to diversify its energy supply, with the aim of increasing the proportion of clean energy in the mix.  China's natural gas usage is projected to increase from the current 3.2% of the nation's energy mix to 8.0% by 2020.  In order to meet this target, CBM & CMM development and utilization has been identified as a priority in China's 11th 5-Year Development Plan.  China has considerable potential for CBM development, but as yet projects are mainly at the exploration stage and there is limited commercial production.  There are several barriers to overcome to move projects from the exploration to development and production stage, including access to advanced technology and equipment, technical expertise, necessary market access and downstream infrastructure for CBM sales, and project financing of a frontier sector in the country. 

Development benefits at the gas production stage include environmental and associated health benefits from cleaner energy, increased energy security from local energy source, employment, and fiscal revenues (royalties, taxes, and government ownership interests in CBM production).

- Fit with World Bank Group Strategy

Within the broad framework of the World Bank Group's operational strategy in China as outlined in the FY06-10 CAS, IFC's strategic priorities include: 

- improving the business environment and strengthening regulatory capacity; 
- expanding access to markets; 
- upgrading corporate practices; 
- expanding access to finance and financial sector development; 
- enhancing environmental sustainability and energy efficiency; and 
- promoting private participation in infrastructure.  

IFC's value proposition in China is to be the preferred financial partner for companies seeking to adopt international standards in governance, environmental and social practices.

The project is consistent with IFC and World Bank Group strategy for China as it supports private sector investment in one of the poor interior provinces of China and in a sector which has the potential to contribute significantly to addressing China's energy and environmental problems.

World Bank has been actively supporting development of China's natural gas market through:

- promotion of the country's energy switch from coal to gas and the use of cleaner coal technologies; and 
- providing technical assistance to the Shanxi government for CBM utilization projects.

IFC is also committed to actively support development of overall natural gas market in China, including current support of the expansion of local distribution infrastructure and expected support for future gas-fired power plants.","","As noted above, the expected development impacts of the project include environmental and health benefits associated with the use of cleaner energy, increased energy security from local energy source, employment, and fiscal revenues.  It is judged that the governance risks to these benefits are relatively low.  Therefore, this is a project that IFC should support.  In addition, the sponsor has agreed to publicly disclose all payments made to the Chinese government.","","","This is a category B project according to IFCs procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

The project is located in the Kolwezi District of the Katanga Province in the South East of the DRC. The total project cost is estimated at $235 million after including capital costs, contingencies, working capital costs and interest during construction. The Kalukundi Concession is held by a JV, Swanmines sprl, owned 75% by ARL (a Canadian junior mining company) and Gecamines  the state-owned mining company  holds the remaining 25% interest.  The Concession contains a number of ore fragments, several of which have been found to be mineralized and will be mined initially by open pit methods.  IFC intends to take an equity interest in ARL, in order to support the conversion of resources to reserves through further exploration (drilling), on-going feasibility study work, including supporting the upgrading of environmental and social planning and documentation to meet international standards.","","","","IFC has conducted an E&S due diligence for the proposed equity investment in Africo Resources Ltd (ARL). A team of environmental and social specialists undertook a weeks appraisal including site visits to inspect important features and planned infrastructure locations on the Kalukundi Concession in Katanga Province, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and held discussions on key issues with the Sponsors management team in Johannesburg, Lubumbashi and Kalukundi and reviewed of key environmental and social documents. These included the approved Environmental Adjustment Plan (EAP, African Mining Consultants, 2006) required by DRC mining legislation, the updated Resettlement Action Plan (Synergy 2007), ARL policies and site maps/plans; and meetings with a set of key project stakeholders. These stakeholders included the Chief and elders of Kisankala Village, the Chef de Groupement (senior traditional leader) of the area, the Mayor of Kolwezi District, the Kolwezi leadership of an artisanal mining organization (EMAK) and local artisanal mining leaders at Kalukundi.The appraisal team reviewed the technical, environmental and social documentation available for the Kalukundi property. The focus was on the preliminary environmental and social data (in the form of the EAP and Resettlement Action Plan), the need for documenting legal requirements as well as the initial results of exploration works such as trenching and drilling. Most of this information had been prepared in the EAP of 2006. During appraisal, the IFC team highlighted the future challenges on community relations as the project progresses to potential mine development.  In particular the IFC team completed a gap analysis on the 2006 EAP which identified additional work which will be required for production of a full Environmental and Social Impact Assessment prior to the mine development stage. Africo has committed to addressing these gaps in the attached Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP).ARLs Health, Safety, Environment, Community and Labour management, organization and systems for the Kalukundi project were discussed extensively during the appraisal. These discussions included staffing requirements for ARLs HSEC functions and the development of adequate environmental, safety and social management capacity. ARL have already started developing this capacity by engaging the services of an experienced Environmental Manager, a Community Relations Manager and a Site Medical Doctor.ARL have committed to develop an ISO 14001 systems-based approach to environmental, labour/social and community management as well as on relations with stakeholders.The IFC PEP-AFRICA (Private Enterprise Partnership) Technical Assistance team are currently undertaking an initial scoping exercise in the Katanga province of the DRC, mainly for projects involving IFC (including ARL), to determine potential assistance to these projects to broaden the developmental impacts.","","","","","","","","","","","","The key driver for this IFC equity investment is support for ARLs development of the Kalukundi exploration property project, as a basis for setting benchmarks on sustainability in resource development in DRC. IFCs equity investment will be used solely to fund the continued exploration of the property, including feasibility studies, environmental and social impact assessments and other preparatory activities. Health, safety, Environmental and Community / labor issues, both positive and negative, will be assessed if and when the proposed project moves into development.This investment is expected to have beneficial results for local employment, livelihoods of surrounding communities and in promoting HSEC best practice in DRC.  Initial material has already been publicly disclosed (see links within this document) including locally.The key environmental, social and occupational health & safety and community aspects and issues associated with this project include;- Exploration activities: dust and noise control, water management including extraction from local streams and drainage, solid and liquid waste management including sanitation associated with the exploration and drillers camps, drilling pads and access track rehabilitation, use of forested and agriculture land for exploration and development, occupational health & safety, visual impacts and community safety, use and disposal of hazardous materials (mainly fuels); and- Surrounding communities: traffic, emergency preparedness and response, educative and preventative measures involving the exploration phase workforce with respect to communicable diseases and negotiation of key mitigation measures relating to future mine development with affected community members, traditional leaders and government agenciesFuture development of the project may have impacts on biodiversity, human populations or cultural property  these will be assessed as baseline work is undertaken. Documentation relating to social and environmental baseline, social and environmental assessment and community engagement and consultation will build on that already completed (2006 EAP) and will be fully in accordance with PS requirements.In this context, IFCs due diligence findings and application of IFCs Policy and the Environmental & Social Review Procedures to this suite of issues resulted in this project being classified as Category B.Any future mine development would be appraised by IFC as a separate investment, with a new environmental classification based upon the projects risks and impacts.

The project is currently at the feasibility study phase with on-going exploration activities to convert resources to reserves, on-going feasibility study work, and the up-grading of the environmental and social impact assessments to international standards.  The feasibility study covers the potential construction of a green-field open pit mining operation with a mining rate of approximately 800,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) and cobalt-copper solvent extraction and electro-winning (SX-EW) plant to produce approximately 3,800 tpa of cobalt and 16,400 tpa copper over an initial 10 year mine life.  The project is secured under an Exploitation or Mining License, issued under the DRC Mining Code of 2003.","","","","","","The proposed IFC investment will contribute to on-going exploration activities to convert resources to reserves, on-going feasibility study work, and the up-grading of the environmental and social impact assessments to international standards for the Kalukundi Project.  Consequently, it is not possible to fully quantify the expected developmental impacts of the project.  Based on the current feasibility study work conducted to-date the expected development impacts of the during the operational phase may include:- Contribution to Local Economy The project is expected to generate the following economic benefits over the mine life: total payments to Government (taxes and royalties) of approximately $200 million; Gécamines dividends of approximately $125 million; payments to suppliers and employees of $800 million. These estimates have been based on long-term cobalt and copper price forecasts.- Community Development  ARL is taking a proactive approach to maximizing the positive benefits of the project during the operational phase to its host community including: current budget of approximately $2.5 million for construction and social development programs in the relocated Kisankala village.  The company, with the assistance of IFC, plans to leverage additional funds through partnership with aid agencies to establish an integrated community development program (ICDP) which will incorporate: - education initiatives to increase child enrolment above the current level of 6% in addition to a women adult literacy programme; - health initiatives focusing on HIV/AIDS, malaria and maternal care; - establish a linkages and supply chain development program incorporating agricultural extension services, construction activities like brick laying etc. - Demonstration Effect on Environmental and Social Standards  IFCs assistance to Africo on environmental and social issues relating to the potential development of the Kalukundi Project should have a positive demonstration effect in the copper-cobalt sector in the Katanga province in the DRC. This investment together with IFCs portfolio investment in First Quantums Kolwezi Tailings Project, also in the Katanga province, places IFC in an opportune position to make a positive impact on some of the earlier projects being launched in the Katanga province.  - Direct and Indirect Employment opportunities for Local Community  Project is expected to employ 540 jobs of which approx. 80% will be Congolese nationals. Should the project move to the development phase, Africo will commit to a training program over the life of mine to develop skills within the local populations that will enable them to qualify for employment at the mine.  Future initiatives will focus on assisting the community to establish business and activities not fully dependent on the mining sector.","","On November 18, 2005, President Kabila signed a decree establishing a multi-stakeholder National EITI Committee. The National Committee is in charge of assuring the implementation process complies with EITI criteria. In February 2006, the Government named members of the EITI Committee and allocated a budget for its operations from the Government finances. Following the recent elections a new committee is soon to be established with a defined work programme for the implementation of the initiative.  Implementation of EITI in the Congolese mining sector is expected to be challenging. ARL is committed to supporting the implementation of the initiative as well as to declaring on an annual basis all payments made to the Government and Gecamines.Furthermore, the DRC Mining Code of 2003, implemented with the assistance of the World Bank Group, requires 25% and 15% of mining royalties, respectively, revert to the province and district / city impacted by the respective mining project.  A portion of the mining royalties reverting to the communities is an important factor in demonstrating sustainable benefits to communities impacted by mining project, and forms an important increment to any communities and social activities voluntarily implemented by the mining companies. ARL working together with the World Bank Group will seek to help ensure that this aspect of the law is implemented with regards to the Project, supported by capacity building at the provincial and district government levels. On balance, IFC considers the governance risks to the realization of the project benefits to be reasonable.  This view is based on the overall situation in the DRC and the range of benefits this Project can bring to the local communities in addition to potential benefits at the national level. This is in addition to a project sponsor that is committed to governance and transparency, and supported by on-going sector reforms being established by the Govt. of DRC and the World Bank.","","","This investment has been classified as a Category B project upon application of IFC''s Environmental & Social Review Procedure, as IFCs equity investment will be used solely to fund the continued exploration of the property, including feasibility studies, environmental and social impact assessments and other preparatory activities.

The Mining Convention covering the Concession area is held by a locally incorporated Rio Tinto subsidiary, SIMFER S.A.  The proposed IFC investment is the acquisition of a 5% stake in SIMFER S.A. and future contributions to equity cash calls until completion of a Feasibility Study for any of the exploration targets in the Simandou Range.  In addition to the equity investment, IFC will have call options to acquire 5% stakes in potential iron ore resources in other Rio Tinto Iron Ore (RTIO) Exploration Licences in Guinea, applied for but not yet granted, namely Simandou North, Simandou South, Forécariah and Diéké (the Additional License Areas). RTIO, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto Holdings plc., has undertaken extensive iron ore exploration work in Guinea since 1996.  Most of the exploration activities were concentrated at the Pic de Fon area within a 7.5 km stretch of the 110 km long Simandou Range.  The current exploration program includes 13 different targets spread out within the approximately 740 km2 Mining Concession, of which the southern zone, namely Pic de Fon and Oueleba are the most advanced. The Pic de Fon - Oueleba prospects have progressed from a pure exploration phase to a Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) phase as of April this year. The PFS and continuing exploration on other targets within the MC have the potential of identifying sufficient high grade resources to support a 70 mtpa mining operation with a mine life of 30 years plus.  During the PFS stage, Rio Tinto will study various mine and infrastructure solutions for the scope identified above, including approximately 710 kms of railroad to transport the iron ore to the coast of Guinea and the construction of a deep water port south of Conakry.","","","","This ESRS has been revised in order to reflect a slight change in the wording relating to the process of categorization of any potential future investment in this project to ensure consistency with IFC procedures.IFCs review of this project consisted of appraising technical, social, health, safety, environmental and community (HSEC) information submitted by the project sponsor along with site visits and discussions with Government of Guinea agencies and authorities by IFC Environment and Social staff. With the investment consisting of equity in Simfer S.A., a subsidiary of Rio Tinto Iron Ore (RTIO), IFCs E&S due diligence has been at the corporate level (RTIO) as well as looking at the Simandou Project exploration and pre feasibility activities. Between August 2005 and June 2007 a team of technical, environmental and social specialists undertook eight (8) visits to Conakry, Guinea including two visits of one week each to the Simandou area to undertake a detailed appraisal of exploration and development activities.  IFC has been interacting closely with the companys management team and the various HSEC consultants on the project technical details, development plan and the environmental and social impact assessments and consultations conducted to-date, and has agreed the additional steps required thereafter.  Further meetings were also held with Rio Tintos senior corporate executives in London, and the exploration and mine feasibility teams in Bristol and Conakry.  The appraisal team has reviewed the technical, environmental and social documentation available to date for the Simandou Project. The focus has shifted recently from initial social and environmental due diligence to a close involvement in the preparation of the Social and Environmental Assessment (SEA) prepared by an independent consultant.  IFCs recent input was to: - reflect the need for a detailed Action Plan per IFC requirements, - highlight community engagement work done and additional information required on the socio-economic profile of the communities potentially impacted; and - assess opportunities for additionalities regarding local economic development.  The IFC appraisal team met with representatives of the Beyla and Kerouane Prefecture including the Mayor of each town, the Prefet, local health workers, and observed a public consultation meeting in Morabidou.  Formal meetings with Government officials in charge of Mining and Environment took place in Conakry and informal discussions with key stakeholders in the Guinée Forestière and Haute Guinée Regions.","","","","","","","","","","","","This project was classified in early 2006 as a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects. Because this project is at an exploration stage moving into pre feasibility work it has minimal environmental and social impacts. This proposed repetitive investment is to enable IFCs continued participation in future rights issues to an existing IFC project.  The activities financed by the proposed follow on investment are the same as those financed by the initial investment and will not result in a change of the environmental and social impacts disclosed for the initial investment.  The development phase is planned to start early in 2010 upon the completion of a Feasibility Study (FS) which will include detailed engineering studies, full Social and Environmental Assessments (SEA) and appropriate due diligence and stakeholder consultations prior to Rio Tintos decision to progress to development or not. The biggest environmental and social challenges to this project recognised to date are biodiversity conservation and the development of a 710 km railway across southern Guinea and a deep water port.  All Rio Tintos exploration, evaluation and feasibility programs employ cutting edge technologies such as remote sensing, aerial surveys, use of a small portable drilling rig that is transported via helicopter wherever possible to test various exploration targets. This ensures that the environmental and social impacts are kept to a minimum through the project cycle, including during the 5 year exploration phase of target assessments in the Concession area.  Environmental and social risk assessments are carried out at each stage of the exploration program in order to minimize impacts and to mitigate residual impacts.Any future mine development financing would be appraised by IFC as a new project, with a new environmental classification based upon the projects risks and impacts. Based upon review of existing environmental documentation, it is considered likely that IFC support for future planned mine development at the site would be classified as a Category A project according to IFCs Environmental & Social Review Procedure. As part of their FS process, RTIO commits to consulting with affected communities both during the drafting of the Social and Environmental Assessment (SEA) and an Action Plan (AP) prior to finalizing these documents.  These and possibly other documents will be publicly disclosed in line with IFC requirements for at least 60 days prior to proceeding with any construction. This set of documentation and the resulting mitigation implementation will ensure full compliance with IFCs Policy and Performance Standards on Social and Environmental Sustainability and IFCs Policy on Disclosure of Information. Rio Tinto has outlined an updated Action Plan in line with IFC requirements aimed at covering all aspects of HSEC management, studies required on environmental and social baseline work, as well as occupational safety and emergency response during exploration, pre-feasibility study and feasibility study activities.

La Confluencia,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Active,Latin America and the Caribbean,Chile,Hidroelectrica La Confluencia S.A.,Regional Industry - INF LAC,2007-07-25T04:00:00Z,2007-09-14T04:00:00Z,B,Loan,"The project (La Confluencia or the project) consists of the development, construction, and operation of a 158 MW run-of-the-river hydro power plant to be located in the Tinguiririca and Portillo Valleys east of the city of San Fernando in Region VI of Chile. The project area is located in the foot hills of the Andes Mountains, approximately 75km south east of the city of San Fernando. Being a run-of-the-river hydropower plant, the project will generate power at a very low cost and will be among the first power plants in the system to be dispatched. The project is located in a remote and mountainous area and is expected to have a very small environmental footprint. The project supports the World Bank Groups emphasis on promoting low-cost renewable energy.","","","","","","In light of the recent gas disruptions from Argentina to Chile (gas curtailments from Argentina were about 6.2 million m3/day on average in 2006 out of a total average daily demand of 22 million m3/day), the Chilean Government is emphasizing the diversification of the energy matrix and the successful implementation of hydropower projects such as La Confluencia, in order to mitigate the impact of similar gas disruptions in the future. Following the gas disruption crisis from Argentina, a number of investment decisions to build new thermal plants in Chile have been postponed due to uncertainty in gas availability and pricing.  Further, the gas crisis has lead to an increase in the cost of electricity supply in Chile as it was necessary at times for thermal units to burn diesel oil instead of gas.The project is a low cost producer of renewable energy and will contribute to the expansion of hydroelectric generation capacity in the Central Interconnected System of Chile (SIC) which supplies the central zone of the country. The primary objective of the project is to help meet electricity demand growth in the SIC, which averaged about 6% per year from 2003 to 2006. As the projects water inflows are primarily determined by snow and glacier melting, the projects hydrology is not closely correlated with that of the system. Hence, it is expected that the project will be available to dispatch at full load from November through March during the dry season, when the hydrology in the system is below average and the SIC has a higher dependency on more expensive thermal generation. The project will therefore provide important climate change mitigation through displacement of thermal generation.","","","","","The sponsors of La Higuera and La Confluencia have an ongoing process to evaluate the environmental and social impacts of these projects. An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for both La Higuera and La Confluencia was prepared by the sponsors and approved by the Chilean environmental agency CONAMA in August 2004. The ESIA was reviewed and disclosed by IFC in December 2004. The sponsors also completed a cumulative impacts analysis of the Rio Tinguiririca as part of IFCs investment in La Higuera. The project sponsors consulted with CONAMA regarding the changes to La Confluencia since 2004, and were directed to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (Declaración de Impacto AmbientalDIA) given the relatively modest changes that have occurred. The sponsors recently submitted the DIA to the Chilean environmental agency CONAMA with updated analysis to reflect the evolution of La Confluencia since 2004.IFC is reviewing La Confluencia against IFCs new Sustainability Policy and Performance Standards. IFC''s review has identified the following potential environmental, social, health and safety issues: - upstream and downstream impacts of river diversion; - dam safety; - construction of access roads and induced impacts of such roads;- tunnel spoil disposal;- land acquisition and economic displacement;- impacts on tourism and recreational activities;- vulnerability of the project facilities to natural hazards;- cultural property; - local employment and in-migration;- labor and working conditions;- worker health and safety;- public health, and community relations and benefits.","The project sponsors are Pacific Hydro Pty Limited, and Statkraft Norfund Power Invest AS (50% ownership each).- Pacific Hydro Pty Limited: Pacific Hydro Pty Limited (PHL), founded in 1992, is an Australian renewable energy company, wholly owned by Industry Funds Management (IFM).

MRMPs primary objective was to expand the existing Magat River Irrigation System (MARIS) to triple rice production in the Cagayan River basin in an effort to attain the countrys self-sufficiency in staple food supply.  The dam is about 3,150 m long and is of rock fill construction.  It was constructed as a multi-purpose project, for both irrigation and electricity generation.  Currently about 85,000 ha of land is irrigated, and irrigation daily requirements (IDR) are discharged on a priority basis.Irrigation activities are conducted by the National Irrigation Authority (NIA), and the 117 km2 reservoir, dam, and intake gates for the Magat hydroelectric plant are owned, operated and maintained by NIA.  NIA is also responsible for management of the watershed upstream of the dam.  The four-unit powerhouse has a rated capacity of 360 MW with a water head of 81 m.  Until privatization, the hydroelectric facilities were owned and operated by the National Power Corporation (NPC), under agreement with NIA.  Water used for electricity generation is regulated by the NIAs MARIS dam about 5 km downstream, prior to entering into the distribution canal system.  Magat operates as a peaking power plant, and water stored in the reservoir is equivalent to about 2 months of typical electricity generation.  Inflow and outflow follow the seasonal patterns of rainfall in the country (rainy season from June to October and dry season from November to May), and the corresponding irrigation schedules.  The reservoir experiences significant sedimentation, the rate of which has increased following the Luzon earthquake in 1990 as well as from deforestation in the watershed. However, a recent survey done by NIA showed the rate of sedimentation has slowed down significantly.  The Magat hydroelectric facilities were privatized through an international tender process as part of the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) of 2001.  The project company, SNAP, took over the hydropower facilities on April 26, 2007.  Under the privatization scheme, the dam itself continues to be owned and managed by NIA.  The proposed IFC loan will partly finance the privatization.  SNAP will put in place new management procedures, implement deferred maintenance, and address technical issues such as sedimentation and operational improvements.  SNAP will also suggest, advise, and assist NIA with respect to the operations, repair, and maintenance of the Dam under the Operations and Maintenance Agreement entered into between SNAP and NIA.

SNAP, the project company, is a joint-venture between SN Power Holding Singapore Pte. Ltd (SNPS) and Aboitiz Power Corporation (APC), two subsidiaries of SN Power and AEV respectively, through a two-tier structure to comply with a local regulation that requires hydro generation facilities to be at least 60% controlled by Philippine entities.  SN Power Singapore owns a 40% equity interest in SNAP directly and another 10% indirectly through its 16.7% equity interest in Manila-Oslo Renewable Enterprise (MORE), while APC will own a 50% interest in SNAP indirectly through its 83.3% ownership in MORE.

A sound financial sector contributes to the development of the local economy and attracts foreign investment. - Development of the SME sector:The SME sector makes up a large share of Senegals economic output and makes several vital contributions, including the creation of jobs and increasing economic activity. Increased access to finance and capacity building for this sector, facilitated by the PCG, can lead to higher levels of entrepreneurial activity, private sector development and improvement in economic output.Furthermore, the project would support the GoSs objective of accelerating poverty reduction by furthering sustainable, equitable economic growth and will: - increase SME access to medium term finance; - promote the competitiveness of selected industries, including enhancing linkages and know-how transfer between large businesses and SMEs and working within high potential value chains to alleviate critical bottlenecks identified through careful supply chain analysis; - promote a conducive business environment for domestic and foreign investment.","","","","","This project has been classified as a Category FI project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

The project area is located in the foothills of the Andes Mountains, approximately 75 km southeast of the city of San Fernando.  La Confluencia is upstream of the La Higuera Project (IFC#21315); the two projects are designed to operate in cascade, and both projects can operate independently in the event of closure of either plant.  The project sponsors for the Tinguiririca Joint Venture are Pacific Hydro Pty Ltd., through its 100% subsidiary, Pacific Hydro Chile S.A., and Statkraft Norfund Power Invest AS, through its 100% subsidiary SN Power Holding Chile Pte. Limited.The project combines water from the Tinguiririca and the Portillo Rivers and their tributaries.  The Portillo branch consists of a low diversion weir, open canals and an 11 km tunnel.  The Portillo branch tunnel also collects waters of Azufre, Los Humos and Riquelme Rivers.  The Tinguiririca branch consists of a low diversion weir, an off-river regulation pondage of 1.2 million m3 live storage, and a 9.3 km long tunnel. The Tinguiririca branch tunnel also collects waters from El Ciruelo and La Gloria streams. The Tinguiririca and Portillo branch tunnels terminate at a concrete lined vertical shaft dropping to the above ground La Confluencia powerhouse via a concrete and steel lined high pressure tunnel. This water will then be discharged directly into the conveyance system for La Higuera for additional power generation.  An 18 km transmission line will connect the project to the Tinguiririca Substation at La Higuera.Several assets of the two projects will be shared, and governed by a Shared Services Agreement: - Back-up Plant:The project will utilize La Higueras 60 MW Colmito gas/diesel back-up plant (Colmito), which is currently being constructed in V Region under an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract.  It is expected to be completed in 2008.- La Higuera Transmission Line:The project will utilize the 38 km transmission line that will connect the La Higuera project to the grid.  The transmission line is being developed for, and will be owned by, the La Higuera project.- Roads:The project will utilize existing private and public roads used for La Higuera projects construction to access the site. In addition, permanent and temporary construction roads will be created specifically for the works within the site boundaries.- Tinguiririca Substation:The project will connect to and use the substation currently being built for La Higuera.- Pondage:La Confluencia will own an off-river regulation pondage of 1.2 million m3 live storage, to be shared with the La Higuera project.- La Higuera headworks and regulation pondage:The project will discharge flow from the project powerhouse into the La Higuera headworks (re-regulation pondage and pressure culvert).The project is expected to sell about 50-55% of its energy production under a power sales agreement with Chilectra, the largest distribution company in Chile.  The balance of the projects energy will be sold in the spot market.  Being a run-of-river hydropower plant, the project will generate power at a very low cost and will be among the first power plants in the system to be dispatched.  As the projects water inflows are primarily determined by snow melting, La Confluencias hydrology is uniquely different from that of the systems rain-fed hydropower projects.  During the dry season, La Confluencia will be supplied by snow melting, and during the wet season from rainfall.  Hence, it is expected that La Confluencia will be available to dispatch at full load during the dry season, when the hydrology in the system is below average and the cost of generation tends to be higher.","","","","IFC invested in the 155 MW La Higuera hydroelectric project in Chiles VI Region in October 2005.  La Higuera, now under construction, is being developed by the Tinguiririca Joint Venture (the company) and is the first of two phases of hydroelectric development planned for this location; the second being the current project, La Confluencia.  An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for both La Higuera and La Confluencia was prepared by the company and approved by the Chilean environmental agency CONAMA (Comisión Nacional del Medio Ambiente) in August 2004.  The ESIA was reviewed and disclosed by IFC in December 2004. The company also completed a cumulative impacts analysis of the Rio Tinguiririca basin as part of IFCs investment in La Higuera.The company consulted with CONAMA regarding the changes to La Confluencia since 2004, and was directed to prepare a Declaración de Impacto Ambiental (DIA) given the relatively modest changes that have occurred.  The company submitted the DIA in October 2006 to the Chilean environmental agency CONAMA with updated analysis to reflect the evolution of La Confluencia since 2004, and have also submitted three Adenda in response to agency reviews (January 2007, March 2007, July 2007).  The La Confluencia DIA was approved by COREMA (Comisión Regional del Medio Ambiente) on July 24, 2007.IFC reviewed La Confluencia against IFCs Sustainability Policy and Performance Standards.  IFC social, environmental, and technical staff visited the project site in December 2006 as part of a supervision visit for La Higuera and an appraisal visit for La Confluencia.  The team met with the companys construction, general, environmental, and human resources managers, the Lenders independent monitors, the Regional Director of CONAMA VI Region, and the provincial governor.Staff reviewed the DIA and Adenda for La Confluencia, progress reporting by the company for La Higuera, and quarterly reports on the technical, social, and environmental performance of the La Higuera project prepared for the Lenders by an independent consulting firm.","","","","","","","","","","","","Development of the hydroelectric potential of the Rio Tinguiririca will be realized by the implementation of two run-of-river projects  La Higuera and La Confluencia.  The ESIA for the combined project was approved in 2004 and reviewed and accepted by IFC.  The company also completed a cumulative impacts analysis of the Rio Tinguiririca.  La Higuera, now under construction, was categorized as A by IFC at appraisal in 2004.La Confluencia is a planned second project in the same area of influence and by the same company as La Higuera.  IFC''s review identified the following potential environmental, social, health and safety issues: - social and environmental management systems;- labor and working conditions;- impacts of river diversion; - liquid and solid wastes, including tunnel spoil disposal;- vulnerability of the project facilities to natural hazards and dam safety;- land acquisition and economic displacement;- impacts on tourism and recreational activities;- local employment and in-migration;- construction of access roads and induced impacts of such roads;- community relations and benefits; and - cultural property.As noted above, the company consulted with the Chilean environmental regulator regarding the changes to La Confluencia since 2004, and was directed to prepare a DIA, given the relatively modest changes that have occurred through evolution of the project.

While the country is now near self-sufficiency in oil, significant new investments are needed, as planned, to grow its oil and gas production from current levels to meet growing energy demand.Promoting domestic private sector participation: Consistent with the governments objectives and those of PROMINP, Programa de Mobilização da Indústria Nacional de Petróleo e Gás Natural, a program coordinated by the Ministry of Mines and Energy with the participation of Petrobras, and other national and industry organizations, that seeks to enhance local participation, skills and industry capacity to support the development of the hydrocarbons sector, this project will promote domestic private sector participation in the oil and gas industry. The local services sector that is being developed can be expected to grow into an internationally competitive one, able to provide competitive services for both Petrobras and other businesses  within and outside Brazil.Promoting competition: Petrobras initiative will help widen the number of players active in this sector, and also creates a positive demonstration effect for other developing countries. IFC will be supporting a private company from a developing country which seeks to increase its participation in the local and regional energy markets.Generating local linkage benefits:Significant domestic expenditures during operations in sourcing goods and services from Schahins growing activities will generate increasing local linkage benefits.Providing local employment, training and development of local skills: With nearly all employment associated with project operations comprised of Brazilian nationals, this project will provide local employment and training and will help develop local skills.Given the above, IFC has identified the following monitorable development impact indicators:  - incremental local labor employment; - annual expenditures in domestic goods and services and - annual training expenditures.","",This project is targeted to provide oil and gas field services to Petrobras and does not make substantial payments to a government.

Since inception, the Bank has issued over $66million of first lien mortgages in Ukraine and now captures approximately 10% of the Kiev capital region residential mortgage market in terms of disbursements, specializing in originating and servicing residential mortgages to individuals.  IMB has ambitious plans to scale up its mortgage operations to help address the deficiency in the Ukrainian market.

Moreover, the project will enable IMB to continue to extend mortgage financing to previously underserved groups.  By providing increased sources of financing to the domestic population, the project will help to address the country's housing deficit, and enable the purchase of homes by a large section of the low and middle-income population segment.

The consortium constituted Airport International Group P.S.C (AIG), a special purpose company which will act as the concessionaire.  The concession agreement grants AIG the exclusive right and obligation to provide airport services at QAIA and charge tariffs for these services.  Such services include the obligation for AIG to operate, maintain and rehabilitate the existing Airports landside and airside facilities; complete the design for, engineer, procure, finance and build a new passenger terminal; and submit and implement a plan to demolish the existing terminal at QAIA once the new terminal is fully operating.AIG has requested both IFC and the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) to provide financing to the project, which is expected to cost $680 million and includes the rehabilitation of the existing terminal, the construction of the new terminal including related aprons and external works, and the demolition of the existing building. The construction of the new terminal is expected to be completed in July 2011.  The project would be financed by a combination of internal cash flow generation ($134 million), equity ($161 million), senior debt ($347 million) and a subordinated loan ($40 million).  The senior debt would be provided by IFC and Islamic Development Bank (IDB).  The subordinated loan would be provided by IFC.","","","","","","The proposed project is a major investment for the Middle East region and the largest infrastructure investment to date in the Kingdom of Jordan. It is intended to address the constraints on public resources available to support the airport expansion in line with capacity needs, and free public resources to other sectors such as social sectors, and as such, enjoys strong Government support.  Additionally, QAIA is the main international airport of the country and its expansion is critical to support the tourism industry, which is of vital importance for the Kingdoms national economy, as it contributes to approximately 10% of the countrys GDP, is the largest export sector and the second largest private sector employer.  Finally, the airport expansion will support the significant growth in foreign trade (imports have increased by an average of 15.4% per year since 2000, exports have increased by 20.9% on average over the same period).The economic benefits of the project are based on the incremental traffic flow that will be enabled by the expanded capacity at QAIA, and will accrue to the GoJ through the generation of additional royalties via the payment of a concession fee; the customers of the airport including carriers, shipping companies, cargo owners, business and pleasure passengers; and the airports employees.Significant benefits of the project include the increased level of service at the airport, the expected increase in the skills of the workforce and related salary increases.  It is also expected that the Project will facilitate the arrival of more travelers to Jordan, hence helping the tourism and hotel industry.","","","","","This is a Category B project because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result from upgrading existing airport facilities and developing a new terminal.  The concession agreement requires AIG to adhere to applicable Jordanian Environmental and Labor laws and standards, as well as to several specific environmental design and operating criteria and some specific, recognized international standards.  AIG has presented plans to address the impacts and other requirements, and will, upon implementation of specific agreed measures, comply with the IFC Performance Standards on Social and Environmental Sustainability.The Airport is located in a relatively remote area  increased noise levels are not expected to have any impact on the sparse residential areas in the vicinity.  Because the project is limited to the construction of a new terminal and related infrastructure at an existing, operating airport, there is no need for additional land acquisition and access.

Given the large funding requirements and the long gestation periods of infrastructure projects, long term equity remains scarce for such projects.

ING Bank adds significant value to domestic companies by helping these companies commercialize their carbon assets, introducing them to international business practices and standards as well as encouraging compliance with required environmental standards in the respective domestic jurisdictions.  ING Bank may also pass on advances provided by IFC, as a Trustee of the Government of Netherlands, to the underlying project companies to meet capital expenditure and other upfront costs.

The financial intermediary is ING Bank and emission reduction projects are considered as underlying sub-projects. The environmental appraisal included field visits of IFCs environmental specialist in August 2007 to a coal mine methane project in the Eastern Ukraine that could provide delivery of ERUs/AAUs via ING Bank. Through the appraisal, IFC confirmed that the sample project is in basic compliance with Ukrainian environmental laws and regulations.  The project mines coal in deep seams located down to 950 meters below the surface. The mine does not provide for coal washing or other enrichment operations, as the coal is delivered as-mined to coking facilities located approximately 200 kilometers away.  Historically this mine has had a number of environmental and safety issues to deal with.  The main safety issue relates to the high methane content in the coal, and this has in the past resulted in several methane gas explosions and fatalities.  The current methane extraction project will, besides limiting the direct methane emissions help the company further reduce the risk for methane explosions.  IFC has recommended additional safety upgrades, which can help the company reduce the risks involved.  Environmental issues have mainly been related to significant particulate emissions from coal fired boilers at the mine site and water extracted from the mine.  The methane extraction project has resulted in the conversion of one boiler on the mine site from coal to gas burning, and a second (new) boiler specifically designed for gas burning is under construction. As a result the burning of coal at the mine site has now stopped and the emission of particulates has ceased.  The mine is a relatively dry mine, but the company is still working on long-term solutions for handling the limited amounts of water extracted from the mine.  Currently the water is being discharged to a series of settling ponds, after which the cleared water is returned to the mine operations for technical water usage.  The mine is testing option for treating the water to a quality where it can substitute the current water supply from public water utilities and own wells.  The mining operation is located away from any residences, is only carried out under open farmland with no buildings present, and due to the significant depth of the mining operation, the narrow seams (height typically below two meters) and a thick buffering sand layer in between the mining operation and the surface, no subsidence problems are evident.

GEF SE Lighting the Bottom of the Pyramid (formerly LED Off-Grid Lighting Initiative),Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Africa,Africa Region,UNKNOWN,Advisory Services,2007-09-07T04:00:00Z,2007-10-10T04:00:00Z,C,"","The project Lighting the Bottom of the Pyramid will engage local and international lighting-related companies to offer the non-electrified population in Kenya and Ghana greater access to modern and affordable off-grid lighting products that can commercially displace fuel-based lighting products (e.g. kerosene lamps, candles). The project is an innovative and large-scale initiative to engage the private sector in the effort to increase access to modern energy services and reduce poverty. The focus on fuel-based lighting is due to its very harmful, yet often underrated, impact on development by reducing households disposable income and living standards, and hurting small business operational costs and productivity. IFCs research found that fuel-based lighting can account for up to 50% of all energy expenses and up to 33% of total household income. In the case of small business, fuel-based light costs from $50/year per lantern (e.g. street vendors) to $1,000/year (e.g. fishermen). Yet, the low quality of the lighting provided by fuel-based devices impairs any productive activity or social development. Greater access to modern off-grid lighting products can reverse this scenario and contribute to poverty reduction. The projects insight is the realization that current consumption of fuel-based lighting represents a large, global market mostly untapped by lighting companies. Independent estimates indicate that worldwide spending on fuel-based lighting in developing countries is $38 billion/year. In Kenya and Ghana alone, IFC estimates the total spending on fuel-based, off-grid lighting to be $1.4 billion/year. This large market to date has been served by fuel-related companies and has been untapped by lighting companies. Hence, IFC believes there is an opportunity to attract lighting companies to enter and compete in the fuel-based, off-grid lighting market, transforming the private sector profit-seeking motivation and ability to innovate into a force to increase access to modern and affordable lighting services and reduce poverty.The seize this opportunity, the project will facilitate the market entry of African and foreign companies in this market by helping firms:- understand the market, including consumer behavior and preferences concerning lighting, acceptable pricing points and distribution channels, and - mitigate the perceive risks of entering into a new market in a region that for most private companies is very challenging. The entry of several companies in this market and their competition for market share will bring to non-electrified citizens a variety of modern off-grid lighting products that are designed, and priced to be better and more affordable than fuel-based lighting. IFC will not pick winners choosing companies or products, but merely facilitate the market entry of as many companies as possible and foster a competitive environment amongst them. To that end, this 4-year project has 5 core sub-actions or phases, namely:- forming the private sector consortium, - performing market research on consumer behavior, including product field testing, - mapping and engaging with the distribution channels reaching the targeted population, - after sharing market findings from previous sub-actions ii and iii with participating firms, IFC will support individual companies in entering this market (e.g. IFC may provide funding to a local assembly plant, trade-finance product to facilitate import of components or products, mobilize micro-financing, etc), and - support the development of institutions to support the market, such as consumer awareness campaign, or establishing systems for product quality controls of modern off-grid lighting products being offered to the unelectrified population in Kenya and Ghana.  The project to date has attracted the interest of over 350 organizations from over 40 countries, and will also be the pilot for a larger World Bank Group lighting initiative called Lighting Africa.","","","","","","The project core development impact will be to increase, in a commercially and environmentally sustainable way, access to modern and affordable off-grid lighting services to the population in Kenya and Ghana that, today, can only access fuels for lighting. Access to modern lighting will positively impact these populations in several ways. Fuel-based lighting is an expensive solution that provides a low quality service of light, and hinders development. For instance, concerning households living standards, fuel-based lighting can account for as much as 15% of a household income. In addition, it is a safety hazard and common source of fires. Furthermore, it contributes to indoor air pollution and related health problems. Concerning social development, poor lighting directly impacts educational performance. Concerning small businesses, such as night street vendors, the high cost of fuel-based lighting limits evening operating hours, and the low quality of the light limits customer traffic and sales, hence the overall productivity of small businesses. Access to modern and affordable off-grid lighting services can revert these conditions and significantly improve the living standards of households, and the productivity of very small businesses. The project targets for the pilot in Kenya and Ghana a market penetration of as much as 10% in 10 years, which translates into 1,500,000 end-users with modern, off-grid lighting products by 2015 in the two countries. The project has support from both governments, and extensive support from the private sector and stakeholders at large. To date, over 350 organizations have expressed interest in the projects approach, and in taking part or being involved in its implementation.","","","","","As an advisory service project, Lighting the Bottom of the Pyramid is not subject to environmental review according to IFC''s Environmental and Social Review Procedure.  At the request of the project implementation team, the Environment and Social Development Department''s Investment Support Group has reviewed the nature of the Lighting the Bottom of the Pyramid activities in question and determined, based on the review, that these activities in-and-of-themselves will have no negative environmental impacts.  The Investment Support Group has, however, identified that the manufacture of WLED does present risks to workers that need to be managed.  Additionally, the disposal of batteries associated with the lighting units also presents environmental risks.  Because of these risks, the project will develop a code of conduct with respect to the manufacture of WLEDs that will be integrated into the parameters for establishing the industry and particularly private consortia involved in production.  Additionally, as part of the policy and institution building, the project will work with the industry to find solutions for reducing risks from the batteries and their ultimate disposal.","The project Lighting the Bottom of the Pyramid is market development effort that will not support a specific sponsor or organization. Rather, the project activities are designed to support all lighting and related organizations that decide to pursue this opportunity, and bring modern and affordable off-grid lighting solutions to the underserved segments of the population in Africa.","The project total operating cost is $6,400,000. Grant funds to cover the project operating costs are being provided by the Global Environment Facility, IFC, the Government of Norway, the European Commission, and the Government of Luxembourg. As necessary and appropriate to support companies entering this market, IFC intends to support directly or indirectly (e.g. mobilizing financing via micro-finance institutions) organizations seeking to enter and invest in this market.","","The project will be implemented in Kenya and Ghana, covering all regions in these two countries, and urban, peri-urban and rural areas.","As an advisory service project, Lighting the Bottom of the Pyramid is not subject to environmental review according to IFC''s Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

CLN represent the credit risk of 26 micro finance institutions (MFI) that are currently in the portfolio of SCBs subsidiaries and branches.  By issuing the CLN, SCB would be transferring a part of its MFI exposure to such institutional investors thereby creating headroom to allow for more financing to MFI.The portfolio currently is diversified over 9 countries in Asia and Africa with 58% of the loans originated in Africa and 42% in Asia. However, the exact mix may well change at the closing date and the replenishment period of the transaction.","","","","","","As part of its commitment at the Clinton Global Initiative, SCB aims to provide $200 million in 2007 in loans and greater support to its existing MFI customers.  It is estimated that SCBs entire $500 million microfinance facility will benefit 4 million people who are currently excluded from participation in the financial sector.  Currently, SCB has been extending credit to MFIs in Bangladesh, India, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Ghana, Kenya and Uganda.  In the next stage, SCB will reach out to MFIs in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Nigeria and China.  The proposed transaction is a core element in SCBs risk management approach and in meeting its goal of reaching the 4 million unbanked customers in Africa and Asia.  By assisting SCB to distribute the credit risk exposure of a percentage of its MFI portfolio, the transaction will enable SCB to leverage the coverage and delivery capacity of its unique network in the emerging markets of Asia and Africa.  The transaction structure will open a new avenue for SCB and possibly others in a similar position, to sell down the micro finance risk in the international capital markets.  What this ultimately means is that this transaction is a precursor to opening up international capital markets for MFI customers in emerging markets.  If this and similar initiatives are successful it could mean a quantum increase in the available resources for the MFI sector in many markets.  Moreover, as this transaction improves SCBs efficiency in allocating its capital, it will encourage SCB to continue investing in this business.As the transaction has a geographically diversified asset portfolio, it affords the opportunity to a wide range of potential international investors to support the MFI sector that otherwise do not have any practical or efficient means to do so.  If the transaction can be successfully closed, it should have a significant demonstrational effect and can be replicated and used on a wider basis.

The company was established in January 2007 as a result of a joint venture between UBA Insurance, a wholly owned subsidiary of United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA) of Nigeria and Metropolitan Holdings Group (UK), a wholly owned subsidiary of Metropolitan Holdings Limited (MHL) of South Africa.  The investment envisages an equity contribution of up to $3.0 million by IFC and corporate governance support for the company at a key stage in its development.","","","","","","The potential developmental, institutional and capacity building impact of the project is high.  The proposed IFC investment in UBA-Metlife will support the development of the insurance industry in Nigeria which is currently undergoing reforms. The Nigeria life insurance sector, in particular, is underdeveloped and the partnership between UBA, a strong local partner, with the world-class industry expertise of MHL, has the potential to transform an existing but dormant local insurer into a viable, world-class life insurer.  
Insurance companies have a disproportionately high impact on economies because they are necessarily large investors who directly affect the general economy through their operations.   In order to settle claims that may arise, insurers invest excess premium income to build a portfolio of financial assets and income-producing real estate which can then be called upon to pay off any future claims that arise.   A vibrant insurance industry can be a reliable source of long-term capital, which is lacking in Nigeria and other African countries.   The provision of quality insurance is therefore crucial for the development of a healthy and dynamic private sector and long-term capital markets.","","","","","Based on the available information, this is a category C project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedure.

The project has an estimated cost of approximately $135 million (including working capital requirements). PET, which is produced from mono ethylene glycol (MEG) and terephthalic acid (PTA), is sold in small pellets and its major use is for the manufacture of lightweight plastic bottles for carbonated soft drinks and water. The projects output is expected to be exported to Europe and the United States and also sold in Egypt, Middle East and North Africa. The project will be the first PET plant in North Africa.  Egypt has significant advantages for the location of a PET plant including:- low logistics costs for sales to the European Union (EU) and North American markets; - access to the fast growing and underserved African and Middle Eastern markets; - excellent port/infrastructure facilities; - favorable trade agreements with the EU; and - proximity to sources of MEG feedstock.","","","","","","- Create employment opportunities:The project is expected to create approximately 450 permanent jobs and 800-1,000 jobs during construction, the large majority of which will be local hires. In addition, the project will provide indirect employment through use of Damietta port facilities, transport to domestic consumers, and procurement of local supplies.- Diversification of Export Earnings:The vast majority of Egypts foreign revenues currently come from the oil and gas and tourism sectors. Given the historical volatility of these two sources, the GoEs stated goal is to diversify its export base over the coming decade to provide a more stable foreign revenue base. The project will contribute to this objective by generating over $500 million in net export revenues (after deducting the cost of imported raw material) over the first 10 years of the projects life, as a result of both direct exports as well as import substitution.- Demonstration Effect:The project will be the first PET project in Egypt and North Africa as a whole, a region which has significant potential to become a world-class player in this industry.  By operating a successful operation in Egypt, the project is expected to encourage other players to establish production facilities in the region.  Also, the training of local employees will improve the quality of workers with experience in the PET industry. - Promotion of Downstream Industry:The water and CSD bottling industries in Egypt, which comprises several small players, currently lack domestic sources of PET resin, which are imported from China or Korea.  Small players cannot hold large inventories and therefore are unable to import economical lot sizes. This project is expected to help the small players improve the efficiency of their operations through savings in logistics costs.  This is also expected to promote the production of new PET based specialty products with higher value-add, such as film, packaging, etc.The key development indicators that are proposed to be monitored during the life of the IFC investment are: - Number of permanent jobs created;- Annual net foreign exchange generated from the projects exports; and- Amount of PET sourced domestically by Egyptian PET converters.","","","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review procedures because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

South-to-South Expansion:

The project will allow Soktas to set up an operation in India, which is in line with IFC's South-to-South strategy, and the sector strategy, which supports expansion of manufacturing capacities in cost competitive environments.  The investment in India will reduce the overall manufacturing cost of the group and improve its access to its traditional markets.

Employment:  

The project will create new jobs in Turkey and India, which will benefit the local economies of both countries. It will also provide additional direct employment with a multiplier effect along the supply chain.

Major terminal elements will include metallic silos, intake, pre-cleaner, transfer, packing, bulk loading, and allied accessories and equipment. Less than 10% of the grain will be moved out of the terminal on trucks while the remainder will be transported by rail to Malawi. This storage facility will be an integral part of  Bakhresa Grain Milling (Malawi) Limited, which in December 2003 assumed ownership and operation of the former Grain & Milling Company Limited (GRAMIL) from the government of Malawi in a privatization process. The two existing flour mills are situated in Limbe, situated approximately 5 Km from Blantyre, Malawi's commercial city.

With greater knowledge governments will be able to allocate resources more quickly (medical staff, drugs and medical equipment) to affected areas, better containing the spread of the disease and managing its treatment. Efficient deployment of resources: Healthcare and related costs rank, in most countries, as the 2nd or 3rd largest (public) budgetary expense.  Paradoxically, the most resource constrained countries squander more healthcare dollars because of lack of information systems that track usage, establish accountability and focus efforts.  Voxivas inventory management tools will enable governments to manage drug inventories and their location encouraging better use and preventing wastage.Better value for the money: Voxivas solutions cost only a fraction of the products offered by other software companies.

Its strategy is to grow into a sizeable upstream operator, focusing primarily on the development of natural gas properties. Currently, Vostoks primary asset is the 3,215 km2 Bortovoe license block which is estimated to hold proved and probable reserves of approximately 370 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas and 19 million barrels (mmbbls) of liquids, as certified by the independent international engineering firm Miller & Lents. The block is located in an industrialized region which is facing a gas supply deficit due to limited local output and insufficient deliveries by Gazprom, the dominant Russian gas producer and domestic supplier.Vostok is currently seeking financial support for its 2007-1Q2009 capital expenditure, which includes: - drilling of new wells; - selective re-entry of existing wells; - acquisition and processing of seismic information; and - construction and commissioning of a gas processing plant and other field infrastructure.  The project is forecast to help increase Vostoks daily gas production from minimal volumes in 2006 to 46 million cubic feet in 2009.","","","","","","The proposed investment will support the establishment and growth of an independent private company in Russias oil and gas sector, operating in one of the countrys frontier regions. Specific development benefits from the project are expected to include: - Enhancing Availability of Cleaner Fuel: The investment will support the exploration for and development of natural gas reserves in Russia, in line with World Bank Group commitments following the Extractive Industries Review. The increased availability of natural gas will promote the increased use of a cleaner fuel (given that natural gas has much lower carbon emissions than coal which is frequently the alternative fuel for power generation in Russia). - Promoting Competition and Private Sector Participation in the Gas Sector:The Russian upstream gas industry is dominated by state-controlled Gazprom. The participation of smaller privately-owned companies is important to the industry, as they often focus on reserves deemed too small to be of interest to larger players. More importantly, these smaller private companies deliver production and recovery rates that tend to be higher than industry averages. - Sustaining and Increasing Local Employment: The project will have a sustaining impact on existing employment levels and will potentially contribute to new job creation in one of Russias frontier regions. The company currently employs 55 people in Russia, all locals in Saratov oblast. It is expected that the number of permanent jobs may potentially double as Vostok expands its operations, with even more employment created during the construction phase. In addition, there is expected to be a considerable benefit through employment of local contractors and subcontractors (e.g. providing oilfield services). - Contributions to Central and Local Government Revenue:  The project will generate fiscal receipts from hydrocarbon production taxes, rent and corporate taxes. A material portion of these receipts (100% of Property Tax payments and over 70% of Corporate Income Tax payments) will be remitted to the oblast government and thus contribute to the development of one of Russias frontier regions. - Enhanced Support for Local Communities: With the implementation of the project, Vostok is expected to step-up its activities in the Bortovoe license block. The communities surrounding these new operations will benefit with Vostoks tailored support programs. With the rollout of structured Community Development Plans, Vostok will be able to enhance the sustainability and efficacy of its social interventions.IFC plans to monitor the following development impacts: - employment,- production of natural gas, and - payments to government.","","A significant part of the project's expected benefits are in the form of employment, both direct and indirect, in a lower income region of Russia, as well as payments to Government in the form of royalties and taxes.  In coming to a view of whether to support this project, IFC has considered the value of the projects benefits and the governance and other risks to these benefits.  In doing so, a number of governance assessments on Russia, including the World Bank Institute's Governance Indicators, as well as Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, have been reviewed.  While the Russian Government's influence in the hydrocarbons sector has increased along with an apparent policy of promoting strong state-controlled champions in the sector, the country's overall fiscal and economic management has been relatively strong in recent years.

Peru LNG,Investment,Environmental Documents,Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Peru,Peru LNG S.R.L.,Gbl Infrastructure & Natural Resources,2007-11-05T05:00:00Z,"",A,Other,"The project involves the construction and operation of a LNG Plant and export facility on the Peruvian coast, which includes a marine terminal, breakwater, and temporary rock quarry. Also, a new 34 inch diameter transportation pipeline will be constructed to bring feed natural gas to the LNG Plant. The pipeline will be approximately 408 kilometers (km) in length, stretching from the Chiquintirca community in the Ayacucho Region of the Andes mountains to the LNG Plant at Pampa Melchorita on the coast. A more detailed description of the Projects components is provided as follows.The LNG Plant is located at Pampa Melchorita on the Pacific coast near San Vicente de Cañete, 169 km south of Lima. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is produced when natural gas is cooled to minus 163 Celsius (°C) at atmospheric pressure. LNG occupies approximately 1/600 of the equivalent volume of natural gas, which facilitates the storage and transport of bulk LNG using specialized ships.The life span of the plant will be a minimum of 30 years and may be significantly extended depending on the operation and maintenance conditions. The plant site has space allocated for a potential expansion by adding a second train.The liquefaction train uses the propane pre-cooled multi-component refrigerant liquefaction technology which is a widely adopted technology.The plant with a nominal capacity of 4.4 million metric tonnes per year (MMTY) will be comprised of the following process areas:Feed gas receiving, liquid separation, gas metering and pressure reduction - The Feed gas Receiving Unit (FRU) will be designed to separate and store any liquids that might remain in the natural gas supply pipeline after initial hydrostatic testing operations. An Inlet Knock Out (KO) Drum will remove any free liquids that collect in the pipeline.Removal of carbon dioxide and water from the feed gas -The Acid Gas Removal Unit will remove carbon dioxide from the natural gas as it arrives from the FRU. Carbon dioxide is removed because it would freeze in the cryogenic process of converting gaseous methane to liquid methane, blocking the process flow. The technology for removing acid gas from natural gas uses activated Methyl Diethanolamine (aMDEA), a tertiary amine.Gas dehydration and carbon adsorption units - The Dehydration Unit removes water from the natural gas. The unit uses a three-bed molecular sieve configuration  two beds operating in the adsorption mode while the third bed is undergoing regeneration. Each molecular sieve bed is regenerated every 24 hours. The Dehydration Unit dries the natural gas until it contains less than one part per million (by volume) of water to prevent gas hydrates from freezing and plugging in the cryogenic liquefaction unit. An Activated Carbon Adsorber will be provided as a safety measure to ensure the removal of any heavy metals present in the feed gas. Heavy metal could cause corrosion problems in the aluminum components of the liquefaction process equipment.Facilities for refrigeration and liquefaction - The refrigerant process employed uses two types of refrigeration cycles to pre-cool and liquefy the feed gas. The feed gas is first pre-cooled using propane refrigerant at four different descending pressure and temperature levels. After pre-cooling, the feed gas enters the main cryogenic heat exchanger (MCHE). In the MCHE, the feed gas is further cooled and totally condensed by the mixed refrigerant (MR). The pressure of the LNG leaving the MCHE is reduced by a control valve and is then sent to the LNG storage tanks. LNG enters the storage tanks at 1.08 bar pressure and minus 163.1° C.LNG and refrigerant storage - Each of the two single containment LNG storage tanks has a capacity of 130,000 cubic meters (m³). The tanks will have a common secondary containment area, as required by National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standard 59A, which Peruvian regulations follow.Propane and ethylene for refrigerant make-up will each be stored in horizontal, bullet-type storage tanks. Two pressurized propane bullets will have a combined storage capacity of 602 m³. Two pressurized and vacuum-jacket-insulated ethylene bullets will have a combined storage capacity of 230 m³.Utilities and infrastructure - The plant will be self sufficient for its water and electricity requirements. Natural gas powered turbine generators will provide electric power and a desalination plant will provide process and potable water. During the first year of construction (Phase 1), while the desalination plant is being built, water from the lower reaches of the Cañete River or other sources will be used to control dust that could be generated during ground preparation. Additionally, fire fighting, flare, and venting systems will provide the necessary safety protection in case of a plant upset or emergency during start-up and operation.Trestle - A trestle will be constructed, extending perpendicularly from the shore to the LNG loading platform. The trestle is approximately 1.35 km long and will consist of a steel superstructure supported by steel piles and a concrete abutment. As an aid for the construction of the breakwater, a rock load-out jetty will be built approximately midway along the trestle for use of loading barges with rock material.  The dock face of the rock loadout jetty is 127 meters long.  The rock load-out jetty will remain in place following construction and will be used for as a berthing area for the tugboats.Breakwater - Because the Peruvian coastline is exposed to long period Pacific swells during parts of the year, a breakwater will provide for safe berthing of LNG vessels and will allow the marine facilities to remain accessible year-round for a continuous supply of LNG. As designed, the breakwater will be situated in a depth of approximately 14 meters of water and aligned parallel to the coastline and the sea bottom contours.  The length of the breakwater that is visible above water is 800m.  Also, a crest elevation of 11 meters above mean low water spring tide will provide protection at the LNG berth from the 100 year design wave with no structural damage to the breakwater while minimizing overtopping.Navigational Access Channel for LNG Tankers - A navigational channel will be dredged to provide access in and out of the berth area for the LNG tankers.  The entrance channel and egress channel and where the LNG carriers make turns outside the protection of the breakwater will be dredged to -18 meters.  The LNG berth area which is approximately 250 meter wide and 500 meter long is dredged to -15 meters. LNG Tanker Berth and LNG Loading Arms - The LNG berth structures will consist of a 30 meter by 20 meter loading platform, four breasting dolphins, and six mooring dolphins. The dolphin structures will consist of open grid decks on beams supported by piles driven through jackets. LNG loading will be accomplished by using four 16 inch specialty pipe-and-swivel LNG loading arms. Three arms will normally be used for LNG loading and one will be used to return vapor to the plant''s Boil-Off Gas (BOG) Compressors.  A gangway is provided for access to and from the LNG ships.Utility Dock - A small utility dock will be provided on the north side of the trestle approximately 90 meters from the loading platform. The utility dock will contain a local control room for the loading dock, be used to berth tugs temporarily, to support seawater intake equipment, and to provide a working area for a mobile crane to support routine maintenance and tug supply operations. The Rock Load-out Facilities will also have the facilities and equipment required for spill containment. The quarry  As stated above, in order to operate the marine facilities safely, it is necessary to build a breakwater for protection of LNG tankers. The quarry site to supply rock for the breakwater was identified through an alternative analysis process and it is nearby the LNG Plant.  The selected site is called GNL-2 and will consist of a quarry and its 25 km long access road.  The volume of rock required is estimated as 3.4 million metric tons for which a total of 7.6 million metric tonnes (including overburden and waste rock) will need to be quarried. The access road is located on land that belongs to the Ministry of Agriculture which has issued the access road permit.  No villages are close to the quarry, the nearest being 7 km away. The area of influence is a desert and semi-desert zone with scarce xerophytic vegetation. The overall Project construction is estimated to last 2 years (4 months for development of the quarry and its facilities, 18 months for quarrying, and approximately 2 months for the decommissioning phase).The new pipeline - The transportation of natural gas for the liquefaction plant will be through the existing Camisea-Lima Pipeline Transportation System (PTS) up to kilometer post (kp) 211 at Huayahura. From this point, a 408 km long 34 inch diameter pipeline will be constructed and operated by PERU LNG to provide the required natural gas to the plant. The pipeline will be designed to transport 677 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD) of natural gas at a pressure of 147 barg (2,160 psig). The natural gas pipeline will be buried for its 408 km length and will include surface installations such as mainline valves, scraper traps, and a pressure reduction station. The burial depth is variable between 1 to 2 meters depending on the sensitivity of the location and the RoW will be 25 meters wide during construction and will be reduced to 20 meters for the operations phase. The route crosses 13 districts in 5 provinces that belong to 2 departments (Ica and Lima). The population of settlements near the RoW is approximately 22,400 inhabitants.Approximately 300 of the 402 km of the horizontal path of the PERU LNG pipeline will traverse the Andes mountains at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to more than 5,000 meters above mean sea level. The regional cli","","","","The review of the PERU LNG Project consisted of a pre-appraisal mission in September 2006 to the project natural gas liquefaction plant site (LNG Plant), the pipeline right of way (RoW), as well as the Upstream and Downstream Facilities (Block 88, Block 56, the Malvinas Gas Separation Plant, Transportadora de Gas del Peru (TgP) pipeline, and the Pisco Fractionation Plant). The appraisal mission was completed in four different trips, the first in May 2007 to the plant site and to the pipeline RoW; a second trip to visit the Upstream and Downstream facilities in June 2007; a third trip to visit Upstream facilities in September 2007; and a fourth trip to visit the pipeline RoW in October 2007. The document review included the Projects technical, environmental and social reports and records and environmental and social management plans. Additional information was obtained from interviews with key personnel of PERU LNG and a range of representatives of communities affected and local NGOs. As part of the on-going due diligence process an independent environmental and social monitoring program is being carried out to verify compliance of the company with the project environmental and social commitments. This independent environmental and social monitoring program started in September 2007.","","","","","","","","","","","","The Peru LNG project including the construction and operation of an LNG plant, marine facilities, a quarry and a gas pipeline, is a category A project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because there are potential significant adverse social and environmental impacts that may be diverse and irreversible.

(Peru LNG or the Company), consists of the development, construction and operation of a liquefied natural gas plant comprised of a greenfield 4.45 million tons per annum liquefaction train (the LNG Plant) and related marine facilities at Pampa Melchorita south of Lima, as well as a 408-km, 34-inch natural gas pipeline.  The project will liquefy natural gas purchased from Blocks 56 and 88 in the existing Camisea gas fields and sell it to Repsol Comercializadora de Gas S.A. (Repsol CG) for export.  The majority of LNG sales are expected to go to Manzanillo, Mexico, where Repsol CG has signed a 15 year gas sales agreement with Mexicos state power company Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE).  Remaining volumes will be sold to international markets, including to Asia and North America.","","","","","","Fit With World Bank Group Strategy:The Word Bank Groups (WBG) Peru Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) is built upon three strategic pillars to support Perus efforts to increase economic growth and competitiveness, reduce poverty and inequality, and strengthen the countrys public institutions.  Within this overall framework, IFCs strategy focuses on: - working to reduce Peru''s large informal sector with technical assistance; - investing and developing projects which address bottlenecks to the provision of basic services and physical infrastructure; - investing in industries with strong competitive advantages such as agribusiness and tourism; - expanding growth to new beneficiaries including Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), housing, and tertiary education finance, and by building local government capacity to deliver services; and - supporting sustainable growth, notably in extractive industries, a key sector within the countrys economy.Specifically, the expected fit between the project and the WBG CPS for Peru is evident in a number of areas.  The project will be developed in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner, i.e. with a minimal footprint during both construction and operation, thereby adequately mitigating environmental impacts, and augmenting social benefits for the surrounding region.  The project will further enhance the countrys gas pipeline infrastructure and provide Peru, as well as the wider regions, first internationally competitive LNG liquefaction facility.  In addition, the significant increase in natural gas production to supply the project will also result in an increase of associated liquids (condensates) which will become available for consumption in Peru, thereby reducing the need for expensive imports and potentially serving as the basis for further development of downstream industries such as petrochemicals.  The project is expected to convert Peru into a net exporter of hydrocarbons after 2010. Anticipated Development Impact:This project will support the monetization of hydrocarbons in Peru. While the country has modest reserves of liquid hydrocarbons, it has significant reserves of natural gas. The project will contribute to the development and strengthening of the country''s natural gas infrastructure, and will play a part in satisfying the growing domestic demand for hydrocarbons.  In addition the project will significantly impact both regional and national economic growth over the coming years through a combination of local investment, generation of export revenues, taxes, and royalties.  Looking at the wider region beyond Peru, a majority of Peru LNGs exports are destined for Manzanillo, Mexico, where the gas will be fed into the national grid as a cleaner fuel for electricity generation (replacing fuel oil), and/or domestic consumption, or may also used as feedstock for petrochemical production thereby serving an important development purpose for Mexico as well as Peru. Specifically, the project is expected to generate the following development impacts:- Creating Local Employment:During the planning and construction phases, the project will generate over 5,200 skilled and unskilled, direct and indirect jobs.  During the operating phase, 150 to 200 direct jobs will be created at Pampa Melchorita, with additional jobs being created upstream in gas production, and indirectly through supplier businesses.  From engineers to security personnel and administrative support, a vast majority of the Projects staff will be Peruvian.  Peru LNG expects that over $1 billion of the Project investment will be in local goods and services, primarily centered around the LNG Plant site. - Contribution to Peruvian Government Revenue:It is expected that the Government of Peru will receive substantial fiscal receipts in the form of corporate taxes, paid by Peru LNG, as well as royalties and taxes generated from the production of hydrocarbons by the upstream Camisea project.  In the longer term, the average tax revenue generated from the Project alone is expected to exceed $100 million per annum.  Incremental royalties generated by supplying the Project with gas for export are expected to exceed $225 million per annum.  A sizeable portion of these revenues will accrue directly to the regions impacted by this Project and the upstream Camisea project.- Community Development:Peru LNG is developing a broad community engagement program in line with its commitment to the sustained economic development of the neighboring communities of Pampa Melchorita, and those located along the Projects pipeline route.  IFC in partnership with Peru LNG are building on the companys existing social development programs to develop new areas for collaboration to enhance local benefits.  Specifically, IFC is exploring projects with the company and sponsors to: - Improve the companys social investment strategy, and enhance stakeholder participation in its design and implementation through the development of third party evaluation and monitoring capacity; - Enhance the companys strategy on local procurement to advance the inclusion of SMEs in its supply chain thereby promoting the long term sustainability of local businesses, and contribution to the local economy; and - Develop a program to further enhance the capacity of local governments in the management and use of tax revenues, in addition to improving social accountability to increase the impact of local public investments. The key development indicators that are proposed to be monitored during the life of the IFC investment are: - Annual LNG sales;- Annual taxes paid to the Government of Peru by PLNG; - Annual direct jobs created;- Annual spending with local businesses; and- Implementation of community development programs including governance capacity.","","It is expected that substantial benefits from the project will accrue to different levels of government in Peru in the form of taxes and royalties from the upstream Camisea project.  In coming to a view on whether to support this project, IFC has reviewed a range of assessments including, but not limited to, the World Bank Institutes Governance Indicators and Transparency Internationals Corruption Perceptions Index. Also taken into account is Perus current engagement with the World Bank Group where the Bank is engaging with Peru on enhancing transparency and building regional government capacity.  At the national level, Peru has already achieved a relatively high standard on accountability and transparency in the collection and distribution of oil, gas and mining revenues, and there is strong national commitment to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and its principles. On balance, given the governance situation in the country and the Projects expected development benefits, IFC believes that this is a project in which it should invest.","","","The review of this project consisted of appraising the projects technical, environmental and social information, several visits to the projects LNG plant, marine facilities, quarry and pipeline right-of way, and visits to the upstream facilities (Block 88, Block 56, Malvinas Plant, and TGP pipeline) and interviews with company managers and operations personnel, and with some representatives of project affected communities.

(the Group or Bolivar), Compañía de Seguros Bolivar S.A., Seguros Comerciales Bolivar S.A. and Capitalizadora Bolivar S.A. (together, the Insurance Companies), hold a number of the Group's operating companies and other non-insurance related investments as part of their investment portfolio.  In order to maximize transparency and improve corporate governance standards, while complying with local regulatory requirements, the Group has decided to eliminate all of its cross-investments and to undertake a corporate reorganization.","","","","","","The potential developmental, institutional and capacity building impact of the project is high.  In addition to a greater transparency, which will flow from the financial reorganization, the re-capitalization proposed for the Group will help reinforce the local insurance industry in the Andean Region and help Bolivar to be better equipped to compete. 

Insurance companies have a disproportionately high impact on economies because they are necessarily large investors who directly affect the general economy through their operations.  In order to settle claims that may arise, insurers invest excess premium income to build a portfolio of financial assets and income-producing real estate which can then be called upon to pay-off any future claims that may arise.  Therefore, a vibrant insurance industry can be a reliable source of long-term capital, which is lacking in Colombia.  The provision of quality insurance is therefore crucial for the development of a healthy and dynamic private sector and long-term financial markets.","","","","","This project entails supporting Grupo Bolivar''s insurance operations and has been classified as a Category C project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

BoB will attract and highlight the best performing MFIs as BoB clients to provide the rest of the market with a best-practice benchmark and offer incentives in the market to attain scale through transformation and or mergers and acquisitions.- Creation of a model wholesale bank for MFI: The Bank will serve as the first wholesale bank for the MFIs, which is currently nonexistent and seriously needed in Indonesia and many other countries. As the correspondent bank, the Bank will offer a range of products and services to MFI to allow for more predictable use cash flow and profitable use of their assets. If BoB turns out to be a successful venture in coming years, it would create a powerful demonstration effect whereby BoB can be replicated in other markets with large number of MFIs.- Deepening the microfinance sector through technology: The Bank will incorporate technology and international best practice in providing services to MFIs. And as a technology-enabled enterprise, the Bank has a distinct value proposition by delivering to its clients the value of scalable electronic banking products and shared IT services which help deepen the microfinance sector.- Broadening MFIs access to international investors: The Bank would facilitate a broader access to international investors for Indonesian MFIs.

Rain is based in Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, India with an installed CPC capacity of 600,000 tons per annum (tpa).  Rain has been an IFC client since the company's inception in 1993-94.  In 2004, IFC financed Rain's expansion, which involved establishing a new 300,000 tpa kiln and associated facilities, doubling the Company's CPC capacity.  A significant added benefit from this project was that waste heat from the new kiln could be used to eliminate Rain's dependence on fossil fuel for power generation, leading to CERs.  In 2007, Rain's CER project was registered with the Clean Development Mechanism Executive Board with an annual baseline GHG emissions reduction estimated at about 164,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.","","","","","","- Development Impact: 

This transaction complements the development outcomes achieved out of IFC's previous project with Rain, which eliminated the primary use of fossil fuels by the Company's operations.  The single largest development impact of the transaction is that over the five year transaction horizon, the generation of an estimated 825,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent will be eliminated, while a total of 2.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide will be eliminated assuming an estimated 15 year life of the project.  Through supporting an Indian company gain access to carbon finance in the way this transaction is structured, the project could encourage similar deals with local companies.

- World Bank Group Strategy: 

The project is compatible with the overall WBG and IFC strategy to support the development of competitive local industry in India. In particular, the proposed transaction is consistent with IFC's approach to Climate Change by helping reduce greenhouse gases and expanding the market for carbon finance.  

The World Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for India aims to strengthen the enabling environment for sustainable privatesector-led growth and support critical interventions of special benefit to the poor and disadvantaged. To support these objectives, the World Bank Group will concentrate its assistance on improving government effectiveness and on promoting private sector-led growth by:

- Facilitating greater competitiveness through: 

improvements in the investment climate;
improved financial intermediation to the private sector; and
direct support to firms to promote sustainable growth and competitiveness;

- Improving the quality and quantity of infrastructure through greater private sector participation; 
- Promoting the provision of private health services; and 
- Improving rural productivity and growth through greater private sector investment.","","","","","IFC has been monitoring the performance of the companys operations as part of the IFC previous investment.

The Fund is designed to invest mainly in one or more of the energy, transportation, utilities and telecom sectors; and to consider other opportunistic investments in infrastructure related sectors such as natural resources, housing, agribusiness and tourism.","","","","","","Infrastructure investment remains among the most important challenges facing Central America. The regions ability to grow, compete, and reduce poverty is constrained by bottlenecks in the power, water, road, ports and rail sectors. Services such as water and energy, which are essential for modern industry and commerce and improve health and social welfare, need to be improved. The infrastructure needs are expected to become even more significant in the context of further regional economic growth and integration. While the public sector still has a large role to play, private sector involvement is required in order to address the infrastructure challenge.A key challenge facing developers of private or public-private partnership infrastructure projects has been the availability of subordinated debt and/or equity capital which have remained a scarce commodity in Central America. This project will thus address a key constraint to the increasing involvement of the private sector in the development of infrastructure projects in the region. This will free public sector capital to be invested in other priority sectors.The Funds portfolio companies will benefit from having an investor capable and willing to share its industry and financial expertise as well as to play an active role in strategic development, implementing change, and establishing contacts with partners.

Tata Ultra Mega,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,South Asia,India,COASTAL GUJARAT POWER LIMITED,Regional Industry - INF Asia & Pac,2007-11-27T05:00:00Z,2008-03-27T04:00:00Z,A,Loan,"Coastal Gujarat Power Limited (CGPL or the company) will build, own and operate a 4,000MW (5 units of 800 MW each) ultra mega imported coal and supercritical technology based power plant at the port city of Mundra in the state of Gujarat in India. The project will be the first 800 MW unit size supercritical technology thermal power plant in India and will likely be the most energy efficient coal based thermal power plant in the country. The project, awarded by Indias Ministry of Power through tariff based competitive bidding, is being sponsored by Tata Power Company Limited (Tata Power or the sponsor). It will sell its generation to the utilities of five different states (the procurers) in the power starved regions of western and northern India through a long term 25 year take-or-pay Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). The project will cost about $4.14 billion and will sell power at 25 year levelised tariff of INR2.26 per kWh which is competitive compared to current prices of bulk power in India. The project will source imported coal from mines of Indonesia and other countries and will use the Mundra port facilities (operated by the Adani group of Gujarat) for the project. The main plant equipment is being supplied by Doosan (supercritical boilers) and Toshiba (steam turbine generators). The project is the first private sector power project in India to be based on the energy efficient supercritical technology. The use of this technology in this plant will help reduce the average Green House Gases (GHG) emissions of Indian power plants per unit of electricity generated in the country. Based on the new technology and other measures being taken by the company, the project will meet the IFC social and environmental Performance Standards. This is also IFCs first financing of a supercritical plant anywhere in the world.The project fits well with the Government of Indias (GoIs) plans of attracting significant investments in the countrys power sector which is facing a huge demand supply gap. India is currently facing enormous demand supply gap of about 11% energy shortage and 14% peak power shortage. This gap is very severe in some states such as Maharashtra which suffer from acute deficit of about 19% energy shortage and 27% peak power shortage. The growing gap in the country could lead to significant impacts on industrial growth and corresponding economic development. It is expected that if India is to sustain its current level of GDP growth of 8  9% per annum, it would need to add about 160,000 MW in generation capacity in the next 10 years. The demand supply gap will also increase as more rural households (currently rural household electrification level of only about 44% in the country) are electrified under the accelerated rural electrification program being currently undertaken by the GoI. Therefore, there is an urgent need to achieve significant generation capacity addition in a short time frame which will help meet the rising electricity demand and lead to economic development of the country. It is expected that large projects of this kind will help reduce the demand supply gap and the economic impact of delays which are encountered by most infrastructure projects in the country. The project will sell power to the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra in western India and Haryana and Punjab in northern India. All these states currently suffer from energy shortages ranging from 7% to 19% and peak power shortages of about 10% to 30%. The project will play an important role in reducing these gaps with cheap and reliable supply which will also help in improving access to electricity in the country.- Abatement of GHG emissions:  The project uses supercritical coal technology, which has been approved by CDM-Executive Board as a Clean Development Mechanism for power projects in India. Due to the use of this technology and choice of unit sizes, the thermal efficiency of the project (LHV, gross) will be higher by about 70%, 30% and 20% as compared to the average thermal efficiency (LHV, gross) of coal based power plants in India, across the globe and OECD. Therefore, the project will result in reducing the average carbon emissions of Indias electricity generation system per unit of electricity supply.IFCs approach towards abatement of climate change impacts includes investment focus on:- renewable energy including small and/or run of the river hydro, wind and biomass sources;- transmission and distribution to reduce technical losses and improve energy efficiency;- supercritical coal technology, ultra supercritical or subcritical coal technology with energy efficiency higher than existing national average of the sector; - enhancing access to natural gas based energy including supporting infrastructure like LNG Terminals, and gas transmission and distribution grids; - improved management of municipal solid waste and waste water systems; and- leveraging Kyoto Mechanisms (Clean Development Mechanism), to enhance the attractiveness of less GHG intensive energy generation and delivery approaches.Since the most technologically proven method of reducing GHG emissions is improving power plants efficiency, IFC is giving high priority to funding more efficient power projects which will reduce the carbon emissions intensity in the country and reduce the average overall environmental impact of the countrys power generation system. It is expected that India will continue to be dependent on coal to fulfill its power requirements due to limited availability and high pricing of gas, hydro and other renewable sources. Therefore, IFC is supporting thermal power projects which have better GHG and environmental performance than the average plants in India, given the countrys large needs for incremental electricity supply.","","","","","","According to the electricity consumption statistics of the International Energy Agency, India has a very low per capita consumption of electricity at about 437 kWh per annum as compared to its counter part emerging economies of China (about 1528 kWh) and Brazil (about 1941 kWh) and much lower than developed economies of United States (about 12541 kWh) and Japan (about 7701 kWh). The country faces severe shortages of about 11% of energy demand and 14% of peak power demand. The regions of the country where the project will supply its generation are the worst affected by the power crisis with energy shortages ranging from 7% to 19% and peak power shortages ranging from 10% to 30% of demand.  The low availability of power is seriously hampering industrial growth/competitiveness and corresponding economic benefits to the country. Lack of growth in power generation capacity and associated transmission and distribution network is one of the most critical factors for India to sustain its current GDP growth rate. It is expected that India needs to add about 160,000 MW in generation capacity in the next 10 years in order to sustain its current GDP growth rate of about 8  9% per annum. This implies that India needs to more than double its current generation capacity of about 132329 MW in the next 10 years which will require huge efforts and investments from both national and state governments as well as the private sector including international investors. The significance of this target is immense considering that India has been able to add only about 40195 MW in generation capacity in the last 10 years. Large power plants such as the proposed project will play a significant role in achieving the capacity addition targets in the envisaged timeframe and will help the country sustain its growth levels leading to overall economic development of Indias large population.  The project will provide a competitive source of electricity to partly reduce the current power shortages and help meet the growing demand for electricity in the country. Cheap and reliable power from the project will help in improving the competitiveness of Indian manufacturing and services industries which have to often rely on expensive standby diesel generation to fulfill their power needs. Competitively priced power will also improve access to electricity in rural and urban areas of the country while reducing the subsidy burden on state governments. Therefore, the project will have significant impact not only in terms of reducing the prevalent demand supply gap but in reducing the average electricity costs in the country leading to improved access and industrial competitiveness.The project will have the following additional development impacts:- Employment: The project will create an estimated 5000 jobs during construction and 700 jobs during operation. This significant creation of employment will lead to economic benefits in the project area and further development of additional economic activities leading to incremental employment.- Growth in port and transmission capacity: The project will source its coal through the Mundra Port which is undergoing a large expansion, a part of which (corresponding to approximately $200 million) will be utilized by the project. The transmission system is also being expanded, at an estimated cost of over $1 billion, to accommodate incremental power from the project. Both these facilities will result in large additional investment in the country and corresponding job creation and economic development.  Growth in transmission capacity will result in strengthening of the inter-state grid system which will enable early development of future power plants which would use these facilities for transmission of their generation to different parts of the country leading to improved access.- Tax transfers: The project will make significant tax payments to GoI, estimated at over $350 million over the life of the project. Growth in the associated facilities and imports for the project will lead to significant additional tax and custom duty payments to the government.- Social and Environmental: Lack of access to electricity (which is dependent on availability and price) has significant deleterious impacts on health, natural resources and environment. Burden of these impacts is often borne disproportionately by women, children and other vulnerable groups. The project will contribute to enhanced access to electricity through supply of cheap and reliable power.- Lower GHG emission intensity: While the total GHG emissions may be high, the GHG emissions per KWh of energy generated from the project will be about 750 gCO2/kWh as compared to 1259 gCO2/kWh (national average India for coal based power plants, 2005), 919 gCO2/kWh (world average for coal based power plants, 2005) and 888 gCO2/kWh (OECD average for coal based power plants, 2005). The project will have a GHG emission intensity which is lower by 40%, 18% and 15% as compared to the average GHG emission intensity of coal based power plants in India, across the globe and OECD.  The project will use about 10.8 million tonnes of coal annual to generate 29,000 million kWh of electricity (net), emitting about 23.4 million tonnes of CO2, based on the imported coal calorific value of 5,750 kcal/kg and 40.5% efficiency (net, HHV) of supercritical technology.  A typical subcritical power plant recently developed in India has generating efficiency of around 35% (net, HHV), and is likely to use 24.1 million tonnes of coal (domestic), emitting 28.8 million tonnes CO2, or 12.5 million tonnes of imported coal, emitting 27 million tonnes CO2, to generate the same amount of electricity.  Assuming both plants use the same imported coal, the project will avoid the burning of 1.7 million tonnes of coal per annum, resulting in a reduction of carbon emissions of 3.6 million tonnes CO2 per year.","","","","","This is a category A project according to IFC''s environmental and social review procedure.

IFC will provide Kashf with total investment of up to $22.5 million equivalent through two separate entities:- $15 million loan/guarantee to Kashf Foundation, to help scale up its group lending product to reach half a million women clients within five years, and - $2.5 million equity investment for a stake of up to 19%, and a standby loan of $5 million in the greenfield Kashf Microfinance Bank (KMB) that is being carved out of the Foundation by transforming its individual loan portfolio. Kashf Microfinance Bank (KMB) is a greenfield microfinance bank to be established and regulated by the State Bank of Pakistan.  Together, the equity and loan will help finance the establishment and portfolio growth of KMB, which aims to reach significant scale quickly by offering savings and deposit products, individual loans and other value-added services primarily to micro and small business owners, especially women.  Within 5 years, KMB expects a loan portfolio of above $270 million equivalent to approximately 375,000 borrowers and over 1 million savers.","","","","","","IFCs participation is expected to have a positive impact on the countrys economic development as both Kashf and KMB will provide financial services (including savings via KMB) primarily to women and small enterprises, which form a large, under-served, yet productive segment of the local economy. Greater access to financial services by populations currently excluded from the formal banking sector will help reduce poverty and expand economic opportunity for low-income populations throughout Pakistan, especially women.  Through provision of a loan to Kashf, IFC would help finance Kashf increased outreach and portfolio growth.  If a guarantee is used, this would also improve the ability of Kashf to source local funds in the future which will reduce foreign exchange risk and borrowing costs.  By assisting in the establishment of a for-profit, national and fully-regulated microfinance bank, IFC would help demonstrate the profitability and sustainability of large-scale financial services to potential new or currently-limited microfinance providers. This is particularly important to encourage new entrants and greater overall penetration given the large unmet demand for financial services for the poor in Pakistan.  Through Kashf and KMB the project will contribute to the expansion of financial services to low income entrepreneurs and wage earners. By 2010 Kashf alone will have an outstanding loan balance of $480 million equivalent and over 1 million borrowers, the vast majority of which are expected to be women. Combined outreach of the two entities is expected to be reach 1.3 million borrowers and a portfolio of over $750 million. Importantly, KMB will be licensed to mobilize savings and expects to attract over 1 million new deposit clients, thus providing low-income populations with greater financial options, revenue-generating opportunities and safe-keeping for their assets. Overall, improved access to financial services should reduce income disparities and create additional jobs.","","","","","This project involves IFC support for the business of microfinance, and has been classified as a Category FI project according to IFCs Environmental and Social Review Procedure.

PhasCon is implementing a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project at each LFGTE project based on the capture of fugitive methane from the landfills at each site.  Jointly or independently with the landfill operator at each site, PhasCon will undertake the following:- Designing, constructing, and maintaining a one meter thick landfill cover system to divert storm water, prevent storm water infiltration, and enhance the anaerobic degradation of the in-place waste; - Designing, installing and operating the LFG collection system to limit fugitive emissions of methane;- Designing, installing and operating a leachate recirculation system for leachate pretreatment while enhancing the degradation of the in-place waste;  - Designing, constructing and operating a power generation system that uses the captured methane to generate electricity; - Establishing an Internet-based communication, monitoring and control system for operating LFG recovery, power generation systems and leachate recycling on a regional basis; and,- Assist the landfill operator with respect to waste placement and management, and the construction of leachate and LFG management systems during waste placement. Each project will be developed in two stages. During the first stage, the final cover system for the landfill, the leachate recirculation system (where applicable) and the LFG collection and conveyance systems will be constructed.  The collected LFG will be thermally treated in the enclosed landfill gas flare. In the second stage, the LFG fueled power generation equipment will be installed at the site and a grid connection established by the electric company, as required by the Chinese Renewable Energy Law.  The law also requires the electric companies to purchase the power from LFG projects. During the second stage, LFG will be consumed by the power generation equipment, while the enclosed flare will serve as a backup LFG treatment system.Each LFGTE project will reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through the capture and treatment of fugitive methane and the displacement of grid-based power, which is primarily supplied by coal-fired power stations, with power generated from the projects.  PhasCon intends to register each LFGTE project as a CDM project, as provided for under the Kyoto Protocol, generate Certified Emission Reductions (CERs), and sell these CERs to the IFC-Netherlands Carbon Facility (INCaF).","","","","","","IFCs goal is to encourage emerging market private sector participation in the carbon market by providing value-added services to support projects long term sustainability.

The landfill is located between Bohai Bay, on which the city of Dalian is located, and the Shenda Highway, which is the north-south road between Dalian and Shenyang.  An overpass for exit from the highway was recently built over Phase 1 of the landfill, which will not be capped or used for LFG collection.  The LFGTE project is under construction and only contemplates the collection of gas from Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the existing landfill.  Active landfilling is only taking place in Phase 3.  Both Phase 2 and 3 of the landfill were constructed with lined cells and have been provided with a leachate collection system.  Collected leachate from the landfill phases is conveyed to an on-site treatment plant, prior to either discharge to the Bohai Bay or recirculation into the landfill to increase LFG production.  Phase 2 has been capped and LFG extraction wells and conveyance lines have been installed.  In Phase 3, LFG extraction wells are being constructed concurrently with the waste placement activities.

- Demonstration effect:  

Punj Upstream will be the first Indian oilfield services company to adopt the Performance Standards and would set a new standard for E&S policies and procedures for drilling service companies. 

- Increase private sector participation and promote competition:  

The emergence of oilfield service companies such as Punj Upstream will help increase the number of attractive options available to private and national oil companies such as ONGC. Currently, private drilling companies only number about 15. As a result, E&P companies operating in India are experiencing delays in the implementation of their exploration and development plans.  Further competition will also allow such companies to develop their assets in a timelier manner.

- Employment:  

The project will create full-time employment for 440 people by 2011.

- Local purchases of goods and services:  

Punj Upstream will seek to procure local goods and services which will be tracked on an annual basis.

- Maximize the use of domestic natural resources:  

The project will lead to the further exploration, appraisal and development of domestic natural resources. Such activities are important to India, given that the country already imports about 70% of its oil requirements and faces a large mismatch between potential demand and supply of natural gas.

IFC plans to monitor during supervision, the number of full-time employees, the amount of local purchases and the number of private onshore drilling companies operating in India.","","Because the proposed project will support a provider of oilfield services and not directly finance any oil or gas production, no royalties and/or other resource taxes are expected to be paid by the company to the GoI.","","","This investment is a Category B project because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result, which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

This project will produce biogas for power, litter residue for use as fertilizer and Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) generated by the avoided release of methane from the anaerobic digestion of the chicken litter and by the replacement of primarily coal-fired grid electricity with biogas-fueled power.  The CERs will be sold to the IFC-Netherlands Carbon Facility (INCaF).  DQY sells high-quality 'green' eggs and has received three different Chinese certifications for the environmental attributes of its production.

Deqingyuan's chicken farm has three million chickens, which produce 220 tons of droppings and 170 tons of wastewater per day. If this waste were not treated efficiently, it would become a pollution source. However, the waste provides an opportunity to generate a significant volume of biogas-fueled power.  The chicken excrement generated in the company's chicken farm will be used as the raw material for the planned Biogas Project and would otherwise be a source of pollution.  After treatment by the anaerobic digester, the residue will be used as organic fertilizer for approximately 19,200 hectares of surrounding corn farms and orchards.  DQY's chicken raising operation consumes 60,000 tons of corn annually produced on local farms.  The estimated income to the local farmers is RMB 40 million.

The Biogas Project's use of an anaerobic digester to treat droppings and generate biogas will avoid the emission of two greenhouse gases: methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O).  Annual biogas production will be approximately 6.5 million m3.  A gas engine will convert the biogas into power, which will sell power to the local grid company.  The project will generate 10 million kWh annually, which will displace predominantly coal-fired power on the grid, thereby indirectly reducing the emissions of CO2.","","","","","","The development of this project accords with Chinese Government's energy industry and technology development plan as well as its strategy for the commercialization and implementation of renewable energy power projects.  The project will demonstrate a renewable energy technology and increase local employment and tax revenue. The project can be expected to improve the air quality in the vicinity of the company's operations and be a demonstration project for environmental protection in China's fowl raising industry.

Such project can supply a large quantity of organic fertilizer for crop production, promote the development of organic agriculture, improve the product quality of the crop farming sector and increase the income of this sector.  The reduction in methane and carbon dioxide emissions benefits the global environment by reducing the emission of greenhouse gases which cause climate change.","","","","",This is a Category C project according to IFC''s Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because this project will have minimal or no adverse environmental or social impact.

- raising the mortgage underwriting standards in accordance with the best industry practices; 
- increasing standardization of mortgage files, documentation, and quality.

- drilling programs aimed to increase production from existing hydrocarbon fields, 
- addition of production and storage facilities, 
- exploration activities within ROCH's hydrocarbon concessions; and 
- potential acquisition of new hydrocarbon assets.","","","","","","- Fit with the World Bank Group Strategy: 

The World Bank Group's (WBG) current program in Argentina focuses on supporting the Government's efforts to make the transition from emergency response and crisis recovery, to sustained growth with improved equity and reductions in structural poverty and an appropriate policy framework for private sector development. IFC's priorities for its direct investments are to provide long-term financing and structured financial products to companies and projects in strategic sectors including: oil, gas and mining; agribusiness and forestry products; and the financial sector.  The proposed IFC investment is fully consistent with this strategy.

- Development Impact:

Contribution to alleviate tight gas market in Argentina: 

ROCH's capital expenditure plan is targeted to increase Argentina's indigenous sources of energy, particularly the monetization of gas reserves. This is important for Argentina, where approx. 46% of the primary energy matrix is supplied by natural gas. Argentina is facing a shortage of gas due to the increase in demand and decreasing production rates, which presents a risk for sustained growth.  The project will contribute to mitigate this effect.

Creation/preservation of local employment and sourcing in Argentina: 

ROCH currently employs 105 people directly and over 40 people through subcontractors in the provinces of Tierra de Fuego, Santa Cruz, Mendoza, and Rio Negro. The project will help to secure these jobs by extending the life of ROCH's hydrocarbon fields. During drilling and construction operations, a significantly larger number of people are expected to be hired through local and regional contractors. This will provide an alternative source of income to local people, whose employment alternatives are mainly restricted to the agribusiness sector.  The project will also have an impact on regional economic activity through local purchasing.

Contribution to Government revenues:

The project will facilitate the sale of increased volumes of natural gas, gas liquids, and crude oil. Associated taxes provide an important source of income to the Federal and Provincial Governments; therefore, the implementation of the project will result in increased revenues for the Government. 

Indicators that will be used to monitor the development impact of the project include:

- Employment maintained/created;
- Payments to Government; and
- Purchases from local and national suppliers.","","It is expected that benefits from the project will accrue to different levels of government in Argentina in the form of taxes and royalties. Benefits to the local population are also anticipated. In coming to a view on whether to support this project, IFC has reviewed a range of assessments including, but not limited to, The World Bank Institute's Governance Indicators and Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. The Government has committed to strengthening public sector performance within Argentina's federal system, with a view towards improving the effectiveness of basic service delivery and building transparency and trust, objectives that are supported by the World Bank Group's current program in Argentina. In addition, the Governments of Tierra de Fuego, Santa Cruz, Chubut, and Rio Negro adhere to the 2004 'Ley de Reponsabilidad Fiscal', meant to promote fiscal discipline at the provincial level. On balance, given the governance situation in the country and the project's expected development benefits, IFC believes that this is a project in which it should invest.","","","This is a Category B project according to IFCs Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects because a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.

The project consists in the implementation of CIFI's business plan, including its expected asset growth and operational consolidation, as well as its potential access to long term funding through the international capital markets.","","","","","","IFC's support to CIFI through the provision of longer term funding and an equity investment will generate high development impact by:

- Reducing the infrastructure investment gap in Latin America: 

Infrastructure investment has high development impact through facilitating economic development. CIFI targets an under-served niche and its operations will be incremental to those being carried out by other regional players.

- Increasing access to basic services: 

CIFI's portfolio covers a wide range of projects including water supply, transportation, power and social infrastructure. Going forward, CIFI is expected to support infrastructure projects that similarly convey high developmental impact for local populations. 

- Demonstration Effect:

Given the high developmental impact of infrastructure investment, IFC intends to foster similar business models in other emerging market regions going forward. CIFI could provide a benchmark for similar models in other regions of the world. 

- Increasing employment: 

Infrastructure investment facilitates local economic activities, hence fostering the creation of related jobs and services; e.g. jobs and services for construction by equipment and construction material suppliers; and jobs created by other businesses linked to and/or located near the project sites.

Soravia Multi-Country Commercial Development Project,Investment,Summary of Proposed Investment (Disclosure Policy 2006),Completed,Europe and Central Asia,Southern Europe Region,SORAVIA INVESTMENT HOLDING GMBH,"Gbl Ind, Manufact, Agribus & Services",2007-12-28T05:00:00Z,2008-01-28T05:00:00Z,B,Loan,"Soravia Real Estate Development GmbH (SRED or the company) is the recently formed, commercial real estate development arm of the Austria-based Soravia Group (the Group or the Sponsor).  The company identifies, evaluates, builds and sells real estate projects in Austria, Slovakia, Estonia, the Russian Federation, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Macedonia and Albania. The companys intended buyers are third party real estate investment funds, although, on a selective basis, some properties may be sold, on an arms length basis, to Soravia Properties GmbH, the properties company within the Group.The proposed project consists of an investment program to be implemented by SRED and comprises a series of commercial real estate development projects (sub-projects) located in Macedonia, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine (the Target Markets). SREDs current pipeline includes 7 sub-projects in the Target Markets at an advanced stage (i.e., land has been purchased for each of these sub-projects) and 5 sub-projects are at an early stage (i.e., land has been identified but not purchase yet).","","","","","","The project will create value by developing real estate sites to better meet market demands for a mix of retail and business activities. It will focus on the countries of former Yugoslavia, primarily Serbia and Macedonia, as well as more remote areas/secondary cities in Romania and Bulgaria, where there are acute needs for such type of urban real estate developments. The project is expected to support these countries urban infrastructure development, thereby facilitating the growth of local and regional businesses. In addition to tax revenues to governments and new jobs creation, other development impacts include: - providing essential and affordable infrastructure to local businesses; - improvement in quality standards; - demonstration effect to other international real estate companies; and - increase in industry transparency.","","","","","Key environmental and social issues associated with this project will be the project design and planning process, including social and environmental assessment and putting in place appropriate permissions.  Designs must incorporate life and fire safety measures appropriate to building size, location and expected use.  Management of occupational health and safety during construction is important.  Once operational, key issues are expected to be the energy efficiency and water use of the buildings since projects are expected to be connected to established utility systems.  The potential adverse environmental and social risks in this real estate development project are few in number and limited in scope, and can be mitigated by appropriate project design.  This is therefore an Environment Category B project.","The project sponsor is Soravia Group of Austria (the Group). The Group was established in 1992 and has its roots in the construction industry. The two main owners are two brothers, Erwin and Hanno Soravia, whose father, Erwin Sr., was among the founders of Strabag, one of the leading construction and engineering firms worldwide. Mr. Erwin Sr. no longer owns interests in Strabag as he sold his stake in 2004.The Group is operationally organized around four business lines: Real Estate, Properties, Equity and Management Services. However, the Groups current legal structure does not reflect its operational structure and the Group is presently trying to fix this by streamlining its legal structure and consolidating the four businesses (including SRED) under one holding company. This process is expected to be completed by Q2 2008. The ownership structure of the new Group holding company will remain in the hands of the families of Erwin Jr. and Hanno Soravia, through their respective trusts which will each have a 50% ownership in the holding.","Total project  cost (i.e. investment program for the Target Markets) is estimated at 680 million (approximately $980 million), of which about 534.5 million (approximately $770 million)  or 79% is for construction costs (including capitalized financing costs) and the remaining 145.5 million (approximately $210 million) or 21% for land acquisitionThe proposed IFC investment will consist of: - a 10 million equity investment (the IFC Equity) in SRED and - a 20 million mezzanine quasi-equity dedicated facility (the IFC Facility or the Facility) which will fund the companys sub-projects.
