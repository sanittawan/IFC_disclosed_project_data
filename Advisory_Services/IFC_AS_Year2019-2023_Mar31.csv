Kenya' s population is young and urbanizing rapidly, putting strong pressure on housing needs. Three quarters of the total population, estimated at 45m, is below 35 years and the country has one of the fastest urban growth rates in the region in 2021 it recorded a growth of 4.3%. The Kenya Bureau of Statistics, in 2018, estimated that 61% of urban households live in slums (compared to 50% and 23% in Nigeria and South Africa respectively). This elevated rate is attributed to rapid urbanization leading to overcrowding and lack of access to basic services. Further in urban centers, 56% of the households (average size 4) live in one single-roomed houses while less than 19% own homes. Urban centers face a shortage of 200,000 housing units annually whereas only 50,000 new housing units are supplied annually, mainly by the private sector. In housing shortages, vulnerable groups like women, children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities are most at risk.

The project will contribute to the newly elected Government's affordable housing goal and provide an opportunity to other counties in Kenya with similar affordable housing challenges develop a scalable housing product.

IFC's advisory mandate is being rolled out in two phases:
1) Phase 1: the project preparation which entails a detailed due diligence covering legal, technical, environmental, and social, commercial, and financial aspects to develop a project structure; and
2) Phase 2, the tender phase where a private party will be procured to develop the project","","","","","",The successful implementation of the project is expected to result in the mobilization of private sector investment and delivery of affordable housing units to eligible individuals under the Government's affordable housing program.,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","",605922,"","",Transaction Advisory,"","",2022-08-30T04:00:00Z

Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board Green Capacity Building,Advisory Services,"",Active,South Asia,India,"","",2022-10-31T04:00:00Z,"","","","The project builds upon approach of the IFC Cities Platform model, providing tailored advisory support to the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). It is one of IFC's first such engagements in India and reflects the importance of supporting the greening of local infrastructure by engaging with subnational entities, including municipalities and cities, as well as state-level entities.

KIIFB is the designated primary entity for financing all large public infrastructure projects in Kerala, with a major portion of its pipeline allocated to urban infrastructure. In addition to financing, KIIFB also has a mandate to appraise projects and oversee construction, whilst the projects themselves are implemented and operated by other State agencies and related entities.

The project covers the following components:

- Component 1 - E&S Capacity Building: IFC will help improve KIIFB's capacity to address environmental and social (E&S) risks. This includes the assisting in the development of Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) and Environmental and Social Management Systems (ESMSs), including gender-based violence and harassment (GBVH), a building code compliance review and a chlorine leak risk assessment for water treatment plants.

- Component 2 - Green Finance Framework: IFC will accompany KIIFB in designing a Green Finance Framework to help it attract green financing and support KIIFB on getting a second opinion on the framework to confirm alignment with the Green Loan Principles and Green Bond Principles. A Green Finance Framework and its application can demonstrate to the market the integrity of KIIFB in and commitment towards green financing by establishing transparent guiding principles for the selection and evaluation of projects.

- Component 3 - Resilience: IFC will help mainstream climate resilience considerations into KIIFB's operations. Amongst others, this will be achieved through helping the development of an overarching Climate Resilience Policy, promoting the inclusion of climate resilience information into KIIFB's project appraisal and funding process, conducting a series of general climate and sector-specific trainings to engineering teams, as well as developing a climate information depository.

IFC also provides advice to facilitate the certification of several hospitals as green buildings, using IFC's own certification tool EDGE and a third-party certification process. Related activities are led by IFC's EDGE Green Buildings Program and through a separate project.","","","","","","The overarching objectives of the project are as follows:

IFC aims to help KIIFB strengthen its Environmental & Social risk management practices, in line with IFC's Performance Standards. 

Moreover, IFC aims to build KIIFB's capacity for financing green and resilient infrastructure projects in the future. This includes helping KIIFB integrate climate resilience considerations into its project pipeline, as well as helping it to develop a Green Finance Framework in line with international good practices.

Overall, it is thus expected that the project will help send a strong market signal that Green financing is possible at the State level in India. It will further help KIIFB establish itself as the primary state vehicle for funding green/climate-compatible and resilient infrastructure in Kerala State.

Companies across manufacturing, agribusiness and services industries often face challenges to create an environment in which employees are engaged and supported to work productively, and in which they can grow and contribute their skills to business success. Understanding gender and diversity dynamics in talent management, creating inclusive workplaces and investing in employee engagement are crucial for increasing competitiveness and profitability, which leads to higher wages and better-quality jobs. In this context, IFC's Workforce Platform aims to address various and evolving employment-related challenges that clients in manufacturing, agribusiness and services industries face when managing their workforce. The Platform offers two approaches to support clients depending on their needs and priorities: (1) Workforce Productivity & Operational Efficiency: This approach provides an assessment (based on Lean manufacturing and Lean management concepts) that helps clients understand where they are situated vis-a-vis global best practices with regards to their workforce productivity and overall operational efficiency, including recommendations for improvements, followed by coaching support to help clients prioritize actions and kickstart implementation.

COMPONENT 1: ESTABLISHMENT OF A RISK MANAGEMENT/PARTICIPATION VEHICLE

The main goal of this component is to enable 1AF to streamline its insurance operations for better time and cost efficiency. Centralized insurance financing would also allow for the pooling of risk across different countries (diversification benefits).

COMPONENT 2: PRODUCT AND CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT

To address the need for 1AF to develop new high quality climate/index insurance products for its farmers, IFC will:
1.	Support 1AF in the acquisition of data that can facilitate more accurate index insurance product development. This includes farmer GPS and remote sensing data.
2.	Provide technical advisory for the development of new insurance products by 1AF. This may include technical review of products developed by 1AF and its other partners, and advice on the establishment of a robust basis risk validation process for index-based insurance products. It may also include the exploration of a corporate-level index-based product, covering 1AF's entire credit portfolio.
3.	Train 1AF staff on agri insurance product evaluation and the management of the proposed risk management/participation vehicle.

COMPONENT 3: HIGH-VALUE INSURANCE TRIAL

1AF's current insurance arrangement only covers 50-60% of the cost of inputs loaned to the farmers. The organization would like to conduct research to estimate the level of coverage that would most contribute to higher farmer resilience (without over-insuring the farmer), i.e., should insurance cover the full value or a certain percentage of the expected yield? In addition, how much premium can farmers afford for the ideal coverage? What metrics should be used to measure farmers' improved resilience? 1AF would then like to use the results to gradually transition its farmers from input-based insurance to this 'high-value' insurance.

IFC will support 1AF in addressing this need by mobilizing resources for a controlled trial in one country (possibly Malawi). This trial will seek to test the impact of different insurance coverage levels on farmer resilience. It will also establish the most ideal metrics to use in measuring farmer resilience to climate risk. Study findings will be made public and could potentially be applied by other stakeholders with an interest in promoting access to resilience-building instruments for the agricultural sector.

A research firm will be competitively selected to design and monitor this study for at least 3 cropping seasons (between 2022 and 2025).
","","","","","","The overall objective of this project is to improve access to quality climate insurance by farmers benefitting from One Acre Fund's agri-financing and advisory bundle. This would ultimately enhance their resilience to climatic and related shocks. More specifically, the project will seek to achieve the following:

1.	Establish a risk management/participation vehicle that would allow One Acre Fund to centralize its insurance operations, have greater flexibility in product options for its farmers, and allow farmers to benefit from the diversification and other cost saving benefits of such a set up.
2.	Facilitate the launch of at least 1 new insurance product based on emerging remote sensing data.
3.	Facilitate the issuance of at least 1.5 million climate insurance policies to smallholder farmers.
4.	Generate premium volume of at least 1.5 million USD.
5.	Conduct a study to determine the level of insurance coverage that best enhances farmer resilience.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",605904,"","",Financial Institutions Group,"",2022-08-16T04:00:00Z,2022-08-15T04:00:00Z

To this extent it needs to offer training that is more suitable for a more technologically adept youth, including offering online courses that can also expand SIDO's reach, training women-owned SME on accessing public procurement. Additionally, like other SME agencies, SIDO should play a key role as an intermediary between SMEs and the government sector, to help guide government policies to be conducive to SME growth.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",606283,"","",Other,"",2022-03-02T05:00:00Z,2021-11-15T05:00:00Z

The use of digital financial services can enhance the outreach of formal financial services to underserved areas and populations, especially when leveraging the extensive coverage of a mobile money network such as Orange Money. The project will help bring a new type of client and new target segments to FIG (MNOs and their distribution networks) that can significantly contribute to increasing SME financing.

Formalization and poverty reduction: Digital credit products (such as Tik Tak) offer an opportunity for borrowers to build a verifiable financial track record and offer an alternative to non-trackable, informal lending solutions. In Kenya, for example, studies revealed that access to formal, digital credit products resulted in a 30% reduction of credits at shopkeepers, a 15% reduction of savings groups loans and 15% decrease of lending from family and friends (CGAP, 2018). Research in Kenya indicates that access to digital credit has allowed 194,000 households to get out of extreme poverty and enhanced the living conditions of women entrepreneurs and head of households. 

COVID-19: The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the important role digital financial services can play in reducing disruptions to supply chains, maintaining economic activity, supporting social transfers and ensuring safe transactions while maintaining social distancing. This project will help OBA develop a product that can give access to credit to mobile money distributors helping them to better manage their activity and their cashflows. 

Competitiveness: The Upstream project is expected to increase competitiveness in digital financial services in West Africa by increasing the volume of transactions providing financing to MSMEs.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",607020,"","",Financial Institutions Group,"",2022-04-20T04:00:00Z,2022-03-08T05:00:00Z

Enhancing Women Economic Participation in Egypt Project,Advisory Services,"",Active,Africa,"Egypt, Arab Republic of","","",2022-08-30T04:00:00Z,"","","","The Project aims to support the government of Egypt introducing greater equality in women's participation in the economy, through suggesting legislative reforms in two areas of access to finance and equal pay for work of equal value, with the overall goal of increasing women's economic participation. The project also aims to support dissemination and raising awareness of the reforms to encourage full engagement of women in economic activities.

Following the legislative reforms, the project expects to support an increase of credit volume granted to women and an increase of equality and reduced discrimination in workplace  as measured by resolved grievance cases/complaints related to equality and non-discrimination, equal pay for work of equal value and related to issues of discrimination in workplace.

The pilot project will:

1. Support the Government of Egypt in implementing legislative reforms supporting women's participation in the economy by: 1) enhancing the existing grievance mechanism for women to file complaints related to of equal pay for work of equal value and non-discrimination in access to finance; 2) support the implementation of legislative reforms through drafting guidelines to be used by all financial institutions in the application of the principle of non-discrimination based on gender in access to finance as well as the implementation of equal pay for work of equal value,

2. Support the dissemination of the enacted reforms on equal pay for work of equal value and non-discrimination in access to finance by 1) conducting dissemination workshops with relevant stakeholders; 2) supporting the Egyptian authorities with a communication and dissemination campaign related to raising the awareness on legal reforms.

3. Measure results on the ground for the achieved reforms. The team will also conduct surveys and focus group discussions with women and other key stakeholders (employers, banks, etc.) to identify the potential impact of the legal changes on women's ability to engage in income generating activities and explore additional areas to support measuring results.","","","","","","Fostering gender equality supports economic resilience and boosts growth. It is also critical in achieving development outcomes, as outlined in Goal 5 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Legal gender equality is associated with a range of outcomes, including higher female labor force participation, and a lower wage gap. As international indexes show, appropriate laws and policies can enhance women's economic inclusion. Beyond eliminating legal discrimination, affirmative-action policies can level the playing field for women's economic participation. Gender inequality, on the other hand, carries high costs. A recent World Bank report estimates the losses in wealth from inequality in earnings between women and men in the Middle East and North Africa at $3.1 trillion.

Legal reforms that enhance gender equality encourage more women to work. According to the Women, Business and the Law 2020 Report, female labor force participation as a percentage of the total labor force in reforming economies increased by 0.70 percentage points, while for non-reforming economies it only went up by 0.21 percentage points, a difference of 0.49 percentage points. This result signifies more women join the workforce overall in economies that are reforming towards gender equality. During the same period the labor force participation rate of women relative to men also increased by 2.05 percentage points for reforming economies, while for non-reforming economies it increased by 1.74 percentage points, a difference of 0.31 percentage points. This means that more women are likely to join the workforce relative to men in economies that are reforming towards gender equality. Legal gender equality is associated with a range of positive outcomes, including higher female labor force participation (FLFP), more women in parliament, and a lower wage gap. Advancing gender equality through regulatory and legal reform enables more women to engage in economic activities.

The Project aims to support the government of Egypt (GoE) in introducing greater equality in women's participation in the economy, by supporting the government in suggesting legislative reforms in two areas of access to finance and equal pay for work, with the overall goal of increasing women's economic participation, as well as on their dissemination, to help in encouraging the full engagement of women in the economic activities.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",605118,"","",Other,"",2021-03-30T04:00:00Z,2021-03-01T05:00:00Z

Africa Health Quality Phase 2,Advisory Services,"",Active,Africa,Africa Region,"","",2022-04-29T04:00:00Z,"","","","The IFC Africa Healthcare Quality Program (Phase II) aims to increase access to safe and quality healthcare across Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by improving the quality assurance processes and practices implemented by healthcare service providers. The project consists of two components: 1. Advisory work to upgrade quality assurance in healthcare facilities; 2. Enhancing knowledge base and awareness on healthcare quality issues.

Component 1.

The project uses tools of varying level of depth and interaction in its engagements with clients: (i) rapid quality assessment, (ii) full quality assessment, (iii) hospital design review and (iv) implementation support. 

Rapid Quality Assessments evaluate the performance of a medical facility across 25-30 performance indicators that allow the facility to identify major gaps in safety practices. 

Full Quality Assessments are used to diagnose the quality of facilities' infrastructure, standards, and procedures. Such assessments analyze good practices in place, pinpoint key shortcomings and describe priority remedial actions across 8 key areas, 34 standards and 158 measurable elements. Specialized tools are applied for assessments of laboratories and imaging facilities. 

Hospital Layout Design Reviews aim to identify potential infrastructure challenges and provide recommendations on how to prevent/address the challenges in the most cost-effective manner. 

Implementation support is provided to client medical facilities that wish to implement a healthcare quality improvement program with support from IFC (trainings and workshops on areas for improvement, periodical consulting on implementation of changes over a fixed period of time (6-12 months), repeat assessments and reviews of refurbishment/expansion plans).

For Component 1, the project will disclose the following results: 
# of entities receiving advisory services 
# of entities that implemented recommended changes

Component 2. 

The focus of Component 2 is on increasing awareness of the healthcare quality issues in select target countries. The project organizes practical workshops and sets local communities of practice on healthcare quality. Through this work, a broader range of market participants can receive information on how to address the biggest gaps in healthcare quality.

The project also provides staff training to help drive quality improvement in medical facilities in SSA. Committed senior leadership and well-trained quality managers are key success factors to enable change in operations that will last.

For Component 1, the project will disclose the following results:
# of workshops, training events, conferences, etc. 
# of participants in workshops, training events, conferences, etc.
# of participants of events providing feedback on satisfaction
# of participants reporting satisfied or very satisfied with workshops, training events, conferences, etc.
# of reports completed

Environmental and Social (E&S) Risks: Project clients may not be compliant with IFC Performance Standards. As part of its Due Diligence process, IFC is in the process of reviewing project risks, including E&S risks, and assessing the consistency of its advice with IFCs Performance Standards. Based on sector and context specific risks, the project has the potential for E&S risks and/or impacts in relation to client incompliance with IFC Performance Standards where related to labor and working conditions, pollution, community health and safety. Health quality assessments may also flag certain E&S risks (i.e., handling medical waste). Therefore, E&S risk and issues contemplated by IFCs Performance Standards may be present. To mitigate this risk, IFC's advice will be provided in a manner consistent with IFCs Performance Standards as defined in IFCs Policy on Environmental and Social Sustainability. Where relevant, IFC will assist the client in defining measures to identify and manage E&S risks and impacts of the business activities supported by the project.","","","","","","In many Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, the quality of care is often relatively low with deficiencies found in infrastructure, clinical competence, and practice. Low-quality health care in SSA causes an almost equal number of preventable deaths each year as the lack of access to healthcare, according to Lancet Global Health Commission on High Quality Health Systems. 

In many instances, the quality of care can be improved at a relatively low cost through the implementation of patient safety requirements and other standards, however many medical facilities often lack knowledge and capacity to establish quality structures and implement quality assurance. The situation becomes even more difficult in low-income and low resource settings. 

In this project, IFC combines firm-level work (healthcare quality assessments of selected healthcare facilities) with targeted sector-level work in several countries, raising awareness about quality and patient safety amongst health care providers more systematically, and building the capacity of regional quality managers and senior leadership. 

The project expects to achieve the following impact through improvements in quality assurance processes and practices that are put in place by client medical facilities in SSA: increased number of SSA patients that receive access to safer and better-quality healthcare, additional financing for SSA medical facilities that was facilitated by project activities.

The project will disclose the following impact indicators:
Value of financing facilitated (US$)
Value of IFC financing facilitated (US$)
Number of people receiving access to improved services (real/non-financial sectors)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",606653,"","","Manufacturing, Agribusiness & Services","",2022-02-15T05:00:00Z,2022-01-01T05:00:00Z

The project will also support activities that promote optimal usage of credit infrastructure, catalyze financing to MSMEs and crowd in additional private sector investment. This program aims to support and leverage the reach of regional central authorities such as BCEAO (West African States Central Bank), BEAC (Central African States Central Bank) and the OHADA Permanent Secretariat, as well as similar activities being implemented under different programs within OHADA. 

In line with the IFC SME Finance long-term business plan on leveraging technology and innovative models to deliver greater scale and impact, the project will leverage on partnerships with industry players to gain an understanding of the market characteristics to develop and pilot innovative products aimed at expanding access to credit by MSMEs.
The project scope will cover four OHADA countries - Burkina Faso (BF), Cote d'Ivoire (CdI), DRC and Gabon - but certain reforms/activities will impact on the rest of the countries across common markets. Upon successful completion of this phase I project, a follow on program will be considered as appropriate. The choice of countries was made in agreement with the OHADA Secretariat, based on a combination of criteria including the need to have a regional balance between West and Central Africa, as well as client commitment/willingness to adopt reforms. 

Component I: Enhancing the Credit Reporting Environment 

The objective of this component is to enhance the credit reporting environment in the region through the review of legal frameworks, modernizing the credit information sharing systems and the development and deployment of value-added services. This component is aimed at promoting access to credit by MSMEs with thin or no credit files. This component will support policy and infrastructure development work in CEMAC and DRC, while the activities in UEMOA will support the implementation of value-added services. 

1.1	Enhancing policy and regulatory framework

1.2	Support the establishment of credit reporting system

1.3	Expand information sharing through onboarding of non-bank financial institutions 

Component II: Enhancing Regulatory and Institutional Frameworks for Movable Asset Lending

The objective is to promote movable asset-based lending by enhancing the effectiveness of the movable asset financing system established in CdI and Gabon under previous IC projects and support the establishment and sustained operation of a movable asset collateral registry in BF and DRC. It will also support market creation activities to boost access to credit by MSMEs that do not have real estate/immovable assets, often preferred by FIs as security for loans and create upstream investment opportunities for IFC.

2.1 Promote the Adoption of Regulatory and Supervisory Frameworks that will facilitate Asset-Based Lending

2.2 Operationalization and digitalization of the commercial and collateral registry (RCCM)

Component III: NPL Management and COVID Response 

The objective of this component is to assist the region in dealing with a potential surge in NPLs due to the COVID pandemic. Although an effective NPL strategy involves several responses at a prudential, regulatory and legislative level, strengthening the insolvency framework and distressed asset market will assist the region in resolving potential NPLs in a manner that aims to maximize creditor recovery.

3.1	Support the implementation of NPL out-of-court workout arrangements

3.2	Support the development and deployment of 'COVID 19 Business Rating/Index for firms'

3.3	Support the establishment and strengthening of SME Rating","","","","","","Alignment to AIMM objectives:  
Inclusiveness: The efficient functioning of the collateral registry and credit information sharing (including onboarding of NBFIs) is expected to increase access to credit for MSMEs, especially those operating in informal markets and ultimately increase the coverage of the credit reporting system. An estimated 0.6 million MSMEs in OHADA are credit constrained due to lack of credit history and collateral. These interventions will also assist in reducing the financing gap for women and youth owned enterprises. The project will also contribute to improving the region's business climate thus contribute to increases in investments. According to the 2017 World Bank Enterprise Survey, nearly 29 percent of firms in Burkina Faso, 37 percent of firms in DRC, 21.3 percent in Cote d'Ivoire, and 29 percent in Gabon, did not apply for a loan due to various constraints. 75 percent of firms in Burkina Faso identify access to finance as a major constraint to doing business, while only 25.6 percent of firms use banks to finance investments. The percentages are equally telling in DRC, 39.1/7.1 percent (2009), Cote d'Ivoire, 45 /30 percent (SME Finance Forum 2017) and Gabon, 30.4/6.3 percent (2013).
Furthermore, a significant proportion (85.7 percent in Cote d'Ivoire and 91.7 percent in Burkina Faso) of loans require collateral that is usually valued at between 152 to 233 percent of the total loan amount (175.5 percent in Burkina Faso, 152.1 percent in DRC, 157 percent in Cote d'Ivoire and unknown in Gabon). The global and regional average is 77.8 percent and 84.3 percent respectively. Lack of appropriate collateral (real estate or land) is among the most widely cited obstacles encountered by MSMEs when seeking finance from Banks. The situation is exacerbated as about 85  90% of microenterprises (operating largely informally and on a cash basis) and small business owners have little to no credit profiles, hampering their ability to access credit from FIs. Poor accounting systems to record transactions and generate credible financial statements adds to the bulk of transactions going unrecorded. Further, the new collateral instruments in the Uniform Act (UA) on Secured Transactions are not reflected in the Prudential Rules applicable to West Africa's banking sector. Banks do not use the new collateral.
Competitiveness  The project will foster increased competitiveness in the MSME financing market through initiatives that promote competition, e.g. implementation of regulations related to the functioning of the secured transaction laws, movable collateral registry, and credit bureau. This will lead to a shift in the overall market as more firms use movable assets-based lending, the number of credit enquiries in the credit bureau rises, and lending to MSME rises. Robust credit reporting systems will enhance competition in the credit markets by providing uniform access to information to all credit providers and providing an opportunity for new entrants like digital lenders the tools to be able to make creditworthiness assessment. The capacity building among lenders on how to develop and roll out asset-based lending products would foster competitiveness in the credit market in the target countries with knock on effect all through OHADA. 
Resilience  The project will improve the resilience of MSMEs and the financial sector. The enhancement of the credit reporting infrastructure is expected to improve the credit asset quality and lower NPLs of the credit providers and enhance macroprudential analysis. The NPL management framework, as reinforced by the implementation of the OHADA business-rescue framework, will result in the survival of more firms and reduce the risk of systemic defaults.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",604977,"","",Other,"",2021-04-27T04:00:00Z,2021-03-01T05:00:00Z

Project Name Pending,Advisory Services,"",Status Pending,Region Pending,Country Pending,"","",2021-11-01T04:00:00Z,"","","","","","","","","","IFC anticipates that this proposal will increase access to digital skills training for under-served groups (particularly young women in Ethiopia) through capacity building and training and linkages with global technology companies that offer employment opportunities for the young people in Africa. Funding Gebeya's incubator will also catalyze the emergence of more female digital entrepreneurs who will now have access to funding and resources necessary to develop and scale their businesses through this program.

Currently, many universities in African countries do not offer comprehensive and relevant training in programming and other software development courses. In addition, the job market has become  increasingly competitive; according to the International Labor Organisation (ILO) the youth unemployment rate hovers around 12% in SSA. While this is slightly lower than the global youth unemployment rate of 12.4%, the African region has the world's highest rate of working poor people who are employed but earning less than US$2 a day. Despite being Africa's most educated generation to emerge from schools and universities, a young person from Africa is twice as likely to be unemployed when he/she becomes an adult, according to the ILO.

The exclusion of women from the labor force further perpetuates generational cycles of poverty. Women account for approximately 50% of Africa's population but only contribute 39% of the Continent's GDP due to limited employment opportunities and lack of representation at higher levels in the organization where employment decisions are often made

The Digital Gender-Ethiopia project will increase the number of female software developers with core technical and job readiness skills who can then go on to establish digital result in the training of at least 250 female software developers. Due to Gebeya's track record in successfully placing graduates of its programs, the Digital Gender-Ethiopia program will result in creation of employment and entrepreneurship opportunities for Ethiopia's growing base of software developers.

Market creation enabled by the project:
The project will develop the entrepreneurship/tech ecosystem, particularly with respect to women entrepreneurs through two distinct channels: capacity building and a demonstration effect. 
Women entrepreneurs face critical gaps due to their lack of access to appropriate networks and know-how that could make them more competitive in securing financing for their businesses. The project increases their capacity by giving women access to relevant training and knowledge which will build critical skills that will benefit them beyond the direct project impacts.  
Secondly, Gebeya's incubator will provide seed funding to at least 20 female digital entrepreneurs graduating from its training programs thereby increasing the representation of women in tech startups in Africa. This is expected to have a ripple effect in bringing on board more women into the ecosystem and resulting in more employment opportunities for women in Ethiopia. As more women entrepreneurs / women led enterprises succeed and start to play a critical role in the broader ecosystem, the number of women pursuing entrepreneurship ventures will increase through a demonstration effect. In addition, IFC's support will help change risk perceptions and, if successful, send a signal to the market which could catalyze more private capital into women enterprises, alleviating some of the gender inequities in access to financing.

As a result of the above, the project is expected to not only increase the inclusiveness of the market,  but also increase its overall competitiveness.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",603451,"","",Other,"",2019-02-26T05:00:00Z,2019-03-01T05:00:00Z

Hence, the Project also seeks to enhance integration across markets by creating mechanisms that enable the flow of best-in-class cooling technology solutions from around the world to South Asia (India, Bangladesh), by reducing mitigating adoption risks.","","","","","","The goal of the TechEmerge project is to accelerate the dissemination and commercial adoption of new innovative sustainable cooling solutions/technologies with high development impact potential in emerging markets by leveraging IFC's global reach.

More specifically, the project aims to:
1. Improve the receptiveness and willingness of corporates in emerging markets, especially India, to adopt innovative and sustainable cooling technologies.
2. Increase the motivation of young technology companies from around the world to adapt and deploy their solutions in South Asia.
3. Refine IFC's value proposition (investment and advisory knowledge, capability and solutions) for capturing and supporting technology for development impact.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",605461,"","",Other,"",2020-08-21T04:00:00Z,2020-06-10T04:00:00Z

Anhui Biochem is one of China's leading biotech companies engaged in the development, manufacturing and supply of antiretroviral drugs, currently exporting its products to 33 countries.  Increasing local pharmaceutical production will potentially ease the current strain on African government budgets and foreign exchange demands arising from a high reliance on imported products critical for the treatment of killer diseases such as HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis B. In addition, on-continent production will reduce the vulnerability of African populations to the type of supply-chain disruptions encountered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
   
The Project requires Upstream support to identify the markets with: (i) the strongest manufacturing capabilities, (ii)  a well-suited enabling environment,  (iii) appropriate potential local partners, (iv) an evaluation of the technological and economic feasibility of each opportunity backed by well-structured economic and financial analyses, and (v) a compilation of the project roadmap to investment.  IFC intends to provide advisory services to facilitate partner engagements, as well as co-funding and relevant internal expertise to manage external consulting engagements and studies required to reach investment readiness within the next three years.","","","","","","The project seeks to build and strengthen local pharmaceutical and medical manufacturing capabilities. In turn, the project will result in (i) increasing availability of critical pharmaceutical products in Africa and (ii) diversifying the pharmaceutical value chain and increasing local manufacturing capacities for critical pharmaceutical products.

","","","","","","The project is well aligned with IFC's strategy and country priorities, as limited access to finance has been identified as a major obstacle to private sector growth in Senegal (Country Private Sector Diagnostic). MSMEs in Senegal have mostly been excluded from access to financial resources and business opportunities despite positive economic growth observed in Senegal over the past few years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project will focus on the financial inclusion of the most vulnerable segments of the population â' women, the youth and MSMEs, including informal firms. It is expected that, thanks to the adoption by local financial institutions (banks, MFIs) of technology and alternative data in their credit evaluation processes, more and more MSMEs, especially informal firms, will access affordable financial products and services and in a more convenient and cost-effective fashion (with reduced transaction costs and shorter loan processing turnaround time). This will translate into increased business opportunities, investments and revenue for beneficiary firms, as well as a reduction in unemployment at country level, and improvement of livelihoods. 
Private sector driven job creation is key for the structural transformation of the Senegalese economy. On the supply side, the project will provide MFIs with innovative technology-based tools for credit risk assessment, thereby allowing them to make significant savings on usually high operational costs associated with servicing risky segments.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",605684,"","",Financial Institutions Group,"",2021-03-29T04:00:00Z,2021-04-01T04:00:00Z

Better developed domestic capital markets can allocate capital more efficiently and allow for better risk-sharing, while also providing an alternative source of funding to complement bank financing, with a view to providing better pricing and longer tenors. Capital markets greatly contribute to mobilizing domestic savings for investment in a variety of key sectors such as housing, industry and SMEs as well as creating jobs and supporting economic development.

Since inception in 2007, the Rwanda capital market has developed an enabling regulatory framework that meets basic requirements for issuance and trading of securities. The market, however, requires further development of conditions for deeper market development to enable more issuance of securities; increase capacity of market players, intermediaries, investors and issuers; and increase trading and liquidity of the secondary market for both government and non-government securities.

The Rwanda Capital Market Development (CMD) project is aimed at facilitating access to long term local currency financing for key sectors. Project activities will focus on increasing secondary market liquidity in the government debt market, increasing supply and issuance of non-government bonds and development of a professional investor base. The project will also assess potential to use alternative investment vehicles and instruments to mobilize long-term financing for strategic sectors such as SMEs and housing.","","","","","","The main source of expected market impact will be derived from in country demonstration effects and replicability of securities transactions issued with the project's support and creation of new capital market products to expand investible options and products.

In addition, any policy and regulatory gaps that are identified while supporting transactions, will be addressed to enable market actors to access financing through a best practice legal and regulatory system for issuance, trading, settlement and investing in long term local currency bonds.

The program will also build capacity and skills of regulators and market participants which will enable these actors to better manage and expand capital markets through improved ability to develop appropriate regulatory and supervisory frameworks and enhanced understanding of opportunities and risks of participating in capital market transactions.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",604231,"","",Other,"",2019-12-07T05:00:00Z,2019-10-01T04:00:00Z

From pre-school to university to technical and vocational programs, education matters for human development and future employment. Rapid changes in technology have shifted the focus of a well-educated worker, in the 21st century, from the qualifications needed for doing a lifetime' job to the skills needed to do specific tasks in jobs that are constantly changing. This is especially relevant for the billion young women and men entering the workforce over the next decade. There are currently 1.8 billion young people ages 15-29 in the world which is about 16% of the global population, making this the largest youth generation in history. The imbalance between education and training young people are receiving and the jobs available have a disproportionately significant impact on today's youth employment crisis. In much of the world, the education system is failing to equip the future generation of workers with the knowledge and skills they need to be productive members of society. Systemic and fundamental changes in education and training, along with a renewed skills agenda with innovative approaches to supporting employability, are needed to successfully address the youth employment challenge.

","","","","","","The Objective of the Skills in South Africa Project is to improve employability-related processes and operations in tertiary level education institutions (TVET, colleges, and universities) in South Africa and thus help institutions to provide improved employability services to students. The Skills in South Africa Project engages tertiary educational institutions through the IFC Employability assessment. The assessment provides a holistic evaluation of the critical factors contributing to employability outcomes for an institution's graduates, such as career services, curriculum relevance, links with employers, and alumni management with scores on each dimension. As a follow up to the assessment, institutions will be able to request advisory services to implement recommended changes and improvements.

The assessment drives data-driven decision making at institutions, complemented with institutional capacity building designed to reorient processes, operations, and systems to incorporate employability into instruction and services. The project will also seek to create knowledge and raise awareness on good practice regarding employability, as analysis derived from the Employability Tool assessments can be aggregated to provide a valuable sector-wide snapshot of the strength of the overall employability proposition in South Africa.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",604960,"","","Manufacturing, Agribusiness & Services","",2020-03-03T05:00:00Z,2020-03-01T05:00:00Z

Strengthening  Tourism Sector Competitiveness in Peru,Advisory Services,"",Active,Latin America and the Caribbean,Peru,"","",2021-03-29T04:00:00Z,"","","","Peru has strong potential to leverage tourism as a source of regional growth and economic diversification. The travel and tourism industries are the fourth largest employer in the country (1.3 million job posts or 7.7%) after agriculture, retail and education, and a substantial employer of both women and youth. Tourism is the third-most important source of revenue within the national economy, generating US$4,895 million (8.8% of total exports) according to ComexPeru, with the potential to further extend its reach into secondary cities and more diverse geographic regions within the country. International arrivals have reached 4.4 million visitors in 2018 and are expected to continue growing, according to MINCETUR. This shows the urgency of achieving a better coordination between all levels of government to manage such growth in the sector.  

At the operational level,  poor coordination and excessive red  tape is stalling the investments needed for the sector to grow, formalize, and move into new areas. These delays potentially represent lost revenues, fewer salaries, lower  taxes, and diminish both direct and indirect channel growth (food & beverage and other services). To use lodging as an example, the number of hotels and other accommodation providers is one of the highest in the region on a per capita basis. However, about half  of all firms in the tourism sector are formally registered due to the difficulties of registering. The consequence for the sector and its reputation is clear: the quality of products and services across the middle and lower ends of the sector is low and will constrain growth prospects and economic inclusion. 

Three destinations are particularly challenged by a combination of high growth and poor coordination: Chachapoyas, Arequipa and Piura. This project will address some of the most critical cross-cutting issues holding Peru's tourism sector back at a destination level. These include business environment issues, accommodation regulation, investment promotion, data and statistics, and adventure tourism standards. 

At the same time, there are multiple coordination failures among national-level entities, between national and regional/municipal entities, and between the public and private sectors at all levels. These were highlighted in a 2013 WEF Insight Report on tourism which pointed to the need for better coordination between the public and private sectors on a range of issues from pricing to strategy implementation.","","","","","","The project aims to strengthen institutional capacity to attract and retain sustainable and inclusive tourism sector investment in target destinations. This will be achieved by regulatory improvement, building institutional framework for investment promotion and supporting development of strong data collection and use on behalf of the Peruvian Government in order to guide strategy moving forward. The intervention is expected to generate jobs directly and indirectly, and generate 20m in investment, plus at least 2 leads on potential infrastructure projects. Specific baseline and targets will be collected and set during the first year of implementation.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",604379,"","",Other,"",2020-01-20T05:00:00Z,2020-02-01T05:00:00Z

The first pillar is the investment lifecycle, which sees FDI as a dynamic relationship with the host economy, and not merely as a one-time transaction. This view corresponds to an investment policy and promotion framework capable of addressing issues along various stages of the relationship between foreign investors and the host economy, including FDI attraction, entry and establishment, expansion, and linkages with the domestic economy. The second pillar is the investment typology, which sees FDI as a heterogenous phenomenon, which can be broadly categorized along four types (natural resource-seeking, efficiency-seeking, domestic market-seeking and strategic asset-seeking).","","","","","","The Objective of Peru Investment Policy and Promotion project is to assist the National Government, through its implementing agency PROMPERU, in creating and strengthening the institutional framework by means of creating a Direction of Foreign Investments which will identify private investment barriers and better understanding the role of existing investment incentives in attracting and retaining foreign investors. The assistance on this area, in close coordination with existing IFC projects, will enable private investment growth in new markets and sectors, diversifying FDI inflows away from traditional sectors/locations and generating an overall increase in investments materializing in Peru. The 10M target will be generated via 8 leads, targeted by Promperu's Investment Promotion Directorship, and 4 commitments to invest in Peru.  

Programmatic approach:
Given that this is a child project that stems off the Peru Growth Umbrella project, this child project will work jointly with the other 3 initiatives (Subnational Doing Business Peru, Investment Promotion Policy and Competition Policy).

Moreover, the availability of robust credit information will help borrowers, including MSMEs, to build reputational collateral over time, thereby helping to increase lending to the Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector that often lacks the physical collateral required by lenders. 
Among other Advisory Services, this project will support improvements to the law/regulatory framework for private credit bureau development, capacity building for APD on licensing and supervision of private credit bureaus and for financial institutions for their participation to the credit information exchange. The project will also support the design and delivery of a public education campaign to increase awareness on the importance and benefits of a private credit bureau amongst lenders and consumers. As a result of an improved credit reporting system, borrowers should be able to use 'reputational collateral' or credit histories to access credit.
Improved availability of credit information should help lenders to make better informed decisions and improve risk management practices for underserved MSME segments, whilst at the same time promoting responsible lending and preventing over indebtedness.

Jordan Integrated Business Registration and Licensing Reform,Advisory Services,"",Active,Middle East,Jordan,"","",2021-02-03T05:00:00Z,"","","","The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is supporting the Government of Jordan (GoJ) in implementing its Investor Journey program which is intended to improve the business environment and reduce business costs across the business lifecycle. IFC will provide technical assistance to GoJ in improving regulatory requirements and procedures for business registration and licensing, which will be achieved by supporting legal and institutional reforms for business registration and selected business licenses and implementing an integrated regulatory delivery system. 

This system will entail an integrated business registry with a streamlined and transparent business registration process. The integrated business registry will facilitate further reforms in business licensing and other regulatory procedures as it will provide the platform for integrating and combining regulatory requirements and procedures through the same point of single contact, which would help achieve major cuts in regulatory procedures. The initial costs for establishing the integrated registry and interoperability framework will be offset by the ability to re-use the same platform to streamline and automate as many licensing, permitting, and other regulatory procedures at minimal costs. 

This project is designed to focus on reforming business registration at the foundation phase, as well as support streamlining and automation of up to five licenses (using the same integrated platform) which will be selected based on readiness and in agreement with GoJ priorities, taking into account GoJ's Licensing Reform Policy Paper and its implementation progress. 

The main client for this project is the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Supply (MoITS) which oversees the Investor Journey program in Jordan. The main stakeholders include the Commercial Registry Department at MoITS and the Companies Control Department, which are the entities responsible for registering sole-proprietors and companies, respectively. The project will also be coordinating with all relevant stakeholders involved in the business registration process, as well as the stakeholders involved in the pilot licenses. During the first year of the project, two pilot licenses have been identified, namely the licensing of private schools and KGs, and licensing of nurseries providing childcare.
The project will be designating a single business registration authority for all types of business using an integrated and interoperable business registry as the official repository of data for all businesses in Jordan. This will involve a complete transition of businesses into the new integrated registry and promote the Companies Control Department as the single business registration authority for Jordan.
","","","","","","The foreseen impact of the project is to create an enabling regulatory environment for investments and business, by improving the predictability and reducing compliance costs and time in business registration and licensing. The project will also enable the Government of Jordan set a foundation for integrated regulatory delivery based on an accurate and updated business registry and other data. A complete, transparent and accurate data business is an important building block of a good business environment, because:

	It gives the government the tools to produce business statistics and design policies, as well as to implement regulatory policy;
	It gives market participants the information they need to value their risks in investing and trading or access a market;
	It is linked to other important areas such as access to finance, financial inclusion, capital markets, collateral registries; and
	It is the foundation for integrated service delivery in government to business services.

The results will be measured by: 

- Time required to register and license a business.
- Procedures required to register and license a business.
- Compliance cost savings for the private sector as a result of improving business registration and licensing.

Rwanda Grain Markets,Advisory Services,"",Active,Africa,Rwanda,"","",2020-11-16T05:00:00Z,"","","","Rwanda is among the poorest and most densely populated countries in Sub Saharan Africa and agriculture is an important contributor to the economy constituting 35% of GDP. Approximately 86% of the agriculture GDP comes from food crops coming almost exclusively from small scale farmers. Despite the good progress in agriculture production, there are still gaps along the supply chain creating a disconnect between production and the industry which has growing demand for quality raw material. This is particularly an issue in the maintenance of quality and in the prevention of aflatoxin in maize due to the wet conditions of harvest in Rwanda.

Significant efforts have been made by other donors (including WFP, USAID,CDI,CHAI) to train farmers on better post-harvest practices, yet the most significant aflatoxin risks in the supply chain occur in Rwanda at the aggregation stage. To optimize throughput of stock and reduce aflatoxin risk, better knowledge and upgrades are needed throughout the supply chain from farm to coops, traders and stock keepers. 
In 2015, the government of Rwanda entered a $66 million JV with Royal DSM (NL) as majority shareholder to form AIFL along with IFCs individual investment of $26 million, a food processing plant manufacturing fortified food for young children and mothers.
The Rwanda Grain Markets Advisory project will take a demand-driven and market-led approach to most of the activities and provide technical assistance to aggregators, traders, off-takers, and a few select coops.  
The IBRD's Rwanda Agriculture team and IFC have identified activities that will allow for complementarity and an appreciation of IFC's market-led approach by graduating some cooperatives to a more commercial model and supporting market linkages. The project is planning close collaboration with IBRD's SAIP project in concrete areas: i) facilitating market linkages for SAIP-supported cooperatives, ii) sharing information on cooperatives to ensure that equipment that will be provided under the SAIP matching grant program will go to the candidates with the most sustainable business plans in place, including rural traders, iii) building on the current IFC AIFL Rwanda project (600717) to continue increasing bankability for the cooperatives that went through the Scope Insight program, approaching financial institutions together aligning efforts to increase access to finance for cooperatives, iv) leveraging the ICT solutions that will be developed by SAIP with project activities to improve efficiencies and market access,  v) Sharing of information and embarking on joint missions and a one-WBG team approach.

Skills in Ghana Program,Advisory Services,"",Active,Africa,Ghana,"","",2020-11-11T13:13:21.74Z,"","","","To accelerate its social and economic transformation, Ghana needs to increase the education system's efficiency and develop a decisive digital skills agenda that will formalize the economy and increase productivity across all sectors. A renewed skills agenda is particularly relevant as Ghana's population continues to expand rapidly from 27.5 million in 2015 to more than 50 million by 2050, with more than 57% of the population under the age of 25 and the working-age population at 75.1%. Leveraging this demographic dividend to build a skilled workforce will be critical for realizing Ghana's development potential. Improving the employability of Ghanaians and attaining greater competitiveness in the labor and markets will produce greater participation of young women and men in the economy.

IFC is the largest multilateral investor in private education in emerging markets and has invested nearly US$2 billion in this sector globally since 2000. IFC has now developed an advisory offer to complement its investment activity in education. IFC's Employability Tool is an innovative appraisal instrument which assesses tertiary education providers, including vocational training institutions, on delivery of employability outcomes in a systematic manner. The assessment provides a 360 degree view of an institution's approach to student employability, including employability strategy and governance, the relevance of teaching and learning to labor market developments, approaches to career services and alumni management, as well as incorporation of employer engagement and information technology.

The Objective of the Skills in Ghana Project is to improve employability-related processes and operations in tertiary level education institutions (TVET, colleges, and universities) in Ghana and thus help institutions to provide improved employability services to students. The Project is implemented in partnership with the National Council for Tertiary Education (NCTE), the regulator, and  it takes a programmatic sector level approach by engaging both public and private institutions to develop a sector level 'language' and data-driven understanding of employability.

In partnership with the National Council for Tertiary Education (NCTE), the regulator,  the Skills in Ghana Program engages tertiary educational institutions through the IFC Employability assessment. The assessment provides a holistic evaluation of the critical factors contributing to employability outcomes for an institution's graduates, such as career services, curriculum relevance, links with employers, and alumni management with scores on each dimension. As a follow up to the assessment, institutions will be able to request advisory services to implement recommended changes and improvements.

The assessment drives data-driven decision making at institutions, complemented with institutional capacity building designed to reorient processes, operations, and systems to incorporate employability into instruction and services. The project will also seek to create knowledge and raise awareness on good practice regarding employability and digital skills, as analysis derived from the Employability Tool assessments can be aggregated to provide a valuable sector-wide snap shot of the strength of the overall employability proposition in Ghana.

Water Innovation Platform Africa,Advisory Services,"",Completed,Africa,Cote D'Ivoire,"","",2020-10-06T04:00:00Z,"","","","Enormous geographic disparities in basic water supply and sanitation leave many populations underserved. Many African water utilities are not creditworthy. So despite the need, private investors struggle to finance large projects that could make a significant impact. New technologies and practices to improve operations, service and efficiency, are constantly being brought to market. However, African utilities are chronically underfunded and often lack the internal capacity to assess these new offers. 

IFC, in collaboration with the African Water Association (AfWA), set up a water innovation platform for Africa (WIPA). Through this approach, experts consult with senior staff at the utilities to identify the issues which would benefit from a technical solution. They collaboratively sort through both proven and innovative technologies which could address the problem. The companies, utilities, and development partners then seek to pilot and transfer the technologies to the utilities. This approach deploys technologies to enhance and upgrade the existing asset base. This thus begins the process of addressing core issues such as non-revenue water, and can lead to subsequent investment for large greenfield investments. 

In 2016, IFC helped set up the first phase of the innovation platform, called WIPA 1, which worked with technical leads at African water utilities to understand their challenges, and then helped them to assess and select proven technologies that best addressed their needs. This second phase of the platform - WIPA 2 - will focus on expansion of the platform by identifying and selecting more technologies, that would be piloted by the utilities. 
","","","","","","The aim of the Water Innovation Platform for Africa (WIPA 2) is to bring robust, new (to Africa) technologies to African water utilities to make them more efficient and effective in the services they provide, as well as more resilient to shocks. The key element of this approach is bringing water utilities together in a supportive forum (at the WIPA meetings) to review pre-screened technology solutions and share experiences. Success of the program will be measured by the number of technologies screened and presented at the WIPA meetings, and the number of trials implemented by African water utilities.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",602917,"","",Infrastructure,"",2019-08-13T04:00:00Z,2019-07-19T04:00:00Z

Afghanistan Business Enabling Project,Advisory Services,"",Active,Middle East,Afghanistan,"","",2020-07-13T04:00:00Z,"","","","Afghanistan is one of the least favored countries in the world to invest in. Country's performance in ease of doing business, retaining domestic private investment and attracting foreign direct investments is extremely low. Key challenges pertaining business enabling environment in Afghanistan are summarized in four broad categories below:

1.	Onerous Business Environment: Business environment in Afghanistan is burdensome resulting in daunting challenges faced by the Private Sector. Business environment is negatively affected by political instability, corruption, limited access to land, electricity, finance and lack of trust between government and the Private Sector. Complex government regulations, tax rates and tax administration are also major constraints on business activities. 

2.	Low investment and capital flight: Domestic and Foreign Investment are affected by unfavorable investment, regulatory and political conditions in the country. Attraction of new investment in a fragile country like Afghanistan can be very challenging, but it is necessary to retain existing investments. However, Afghanistan lacks a clear retention strategy that makes it difficult to retain current investments and results in capital flight.

3.	Legal barriers on economic participation of women: Conducting business in Afghanistan is particularly difficult for women. The share of women among business owners in Afghanistan is the lowest in the world. There is lack of evidence-based research whether legal text limits women's equal access to entrepreneurship opportunities or if legislative text translates into gender biased implementation.

4.	Low institutional capacity: Institutional capacity in Afghanistan is a key challenge that results in bureaucracy, a complex regulatory framework, and widespread corruption.

The overall objective of the project is to catalyze doing business reforms in Afghanistan. Project specific objectives are:

1.	Streamline the legal and regulatory framework for doing business in select Doing Business Indicators. These will likely be: Dealing with Construction permits, Trading Across Border, Paying Taxes, Getting Electricity and Getting Credit. 

2.	Strengthen inter-agency coordination mechanisms on investment climate reforms and establish effective public-private dialogue mechanisms    

The implementation of the project started in January 2018. Since then, the project achieved significant milestones that contributed in improvement of business climate in Afghanistan:

I.	Drafted Doing Business Reform Memorandum for 10 Doing Business Indicators. It provides short, medium and long-term recommendations for GoIRA. The recommendations of the Memo have been imbedded in the 5-year national priority program on private sector development in Afghanistan as a roadmap to improve investment climate.

II.	The project supported Government of Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GoIRA) in drafting a 5-year National Priority Program and short-term action plans for Private Sector Development in the country. 

III.	The project helped the GoIRA in implementation of some of the recommendations under the DB reform memo. the project team reviewed and provided inputs in the revision of Limited Liability Company and new Insolvency laws.  As a result of the recommendations, the country moved up in the ranking of countries in the Doing Business report from 183 in 2018 to 167 in 2019. 

IV.	To strengthen coordination efforts, the project is providing technical support to Executive Committee on Private Sector development (PriSEC) to undertake coordination and monitor progress of reforms' implementation. PriSEC is a high-level platform that coordinates and monitors reforms for private sector development.


","","","","","","The overall objective of the project is to catalyze doing business reforms in Afghanistan, with emphasis on areas with the greatest potential to contribute to the improvement of investment climate and investment facilitation. This will be achieved through strategic support from the Doing Business reform team to capacitate GoIRA as reform institution, improvements in interagency coordination and public-private dialogue.

In addition, the project will support AMRU for IFS Foods Standard certification, which enables AMRU to enter into retail markets. The project aims to enhance overall AMRU supply chain performance and increase revenues for firm and smallholder farmers through improving productivity and efficiency through training and adoption of new practices, technologies and inputs.

Despite the undisputed development taken place over the past years, the Cambodia rice sector still faces some key challenges including insufficient and inadequate supply from farmers, poor process quality, and poor market access. At farm level, challenges lie with still suboptimal farming practices, limited application of respective technologies, relevant know-how, insufficient quantities of improved seed, other quality inputs, and access to finance. Yield is lowest among rice production countries in the Mekong (2.8MT/ha vs 4.5 in Vietnam and 3.2 in Thailand). A lack of strong organizational structures slows productivity gain: Agriculture Cooperatives (AC) can assist their members to obtain quality inputs at more economical condition and facilitate access to finance. In addition, women farmers play important roles in both rice production and post-harvest activities, particularly in managing household incomes and expenditures. However, women farmers have limited knowledge on financial literacy and business management skills, preventing them from making the productive decision and participation in AC leadership roles.  

At mill level, remaining inefficiencies in processing, storage capacity, control over the supply chain and weak or lack of extension services, paired with limited marketing knowledge, result in low value addition and limited growth opportunities. Furthermore, poor market access due to lack of knowledge on potential markets, and product and market diversification limits Cambodia rice sector to fully realize its potential growth.    

In addition, the rice sector's fast devolvement and continued growth come at a price to the environment and cause a variety of challenges on farm, mill and firm levels. To sustain production without depleting & destroying essential natural resources, environmentally-smart production processes are needed. Rice milling must become more cost efficient to gain economic competitiveness. To supply large retailers in high value markets, exporters must improve corporate governance and adopt Environment, Health and Sustainability Management Systems (EHS MS). Meeting such buyers' audit requirements is fundamental and include various product and production quality certification.

Health Q Egypt,Advisory Services,"",Active,Africa,"Egypt, Arab Republic of","","",2020-06-11T04:00:00Z,"","","","The Egypt Healthcare Quality Project consists of two components: 

Component 1: Advisory work to upgrade quality assurance in healthcare facilities. The project will work with healthcare facilities to increase the quality of care. The team will apply advisory offerings with varying level of depth and interaction with clients. We expect that the three major demanded offerings are (i) rapid quality assessment, (ii) full quality assessment, and (iii) implementation support. 

Component 2: Enhancing awareness of healthcare quality and patient safety issues by medical facilities and capacity to advise healthcare facilities on such issues across the healthcare sector in Egypt by: (a) delivering of awareness events and (b) providing training to local healthcare quality service providers to develop a cadre of experts who can advise healthcare facilities in the future.

IFC's healthcare quality assessments and follow up quality improvement programs will provide clients with clear understanding of the deficiencies in quality and action plans to implement improvements. A knowledge base on health quality assurance will be made available to clinics, hospitals and diagnostic centers. The service will become more accessible to clients in Egypt through development of qualified consultants who can deliver assessments and thus facilitate tangible improvements in processes and quality of care. The project will promote and support good practice that directly contributes to the continued development of health services in Egypt, as health care providers with better quality assurance practices are more likely to attract investment. With improvements in quality assurance processes and practices implemented by medical facilities in the region, more patients in Egypt will receive access to safe and quality health care.","","","","","","Lack of quality assurance and patient safety in Egypt is a major concern. Even basic safety practices are still not universally implemented. According to a 2018 analysis published by Lancet *, poor quality of care in Egypt results in more preventable deaths (~63k/year) than deaths due to lack of access to healthcare services (~31k/year). Developmental assistance in health area is often targeted towards communicable diseases and maternal and child health. While better quality assurance standards can directly contribute to eliminating those issues, healthcare providers in Egypt are rarely aware how to enhance quality assurance and entailed benefits for safety of its patients. Registration and Accreditation requirements are introduced, but medical facilities lack clarity of the standards, the compliance criteria and the assessment methodology.   

The overall goal of the IFC Egypt Quality Advisory Program is to increase access to safe and quality healthcare by improving the quality assurance processes and practices by healthcare service providers in Egypt. IFC will also enhance awareness and knowledge of quality assurance processes by healthcare providers and other stakeholders. This will contribute among other factors to increased investment in healthcare facilities as healthcare providers with better quality assurance practices can become more attractive investment targets for IFC and other financiers. The program is expected to achieve the following impact targets within 2 years after project completion: 
- 210,000 people receiving access to improved healthcare services from program clients.  
- At least US$50 million financing from all financiers facilitated by project activities.

The assessment will typically indicate good practices in place, key shortcomings and priority remedial actions.   Select clients that are interested in implementing Health care quality improvement program with IFC support will receive tailored advice based on priority areas identified by quality assessment. Implementation support may include training and workshops on improvement areas, ongoing consultations and a repeat assessment.

Component 2.

-	Development of case studies, reports, and/or short notes based on the client-level work in this project or experiences of the project's clients related to improving quality standards, and the effects of those improvements. They can be used to promote quality of care, ethics, patient and family rights, medication management and use, quality improvement and patient safety, infection control, facility management and safety.

The project will have two components:  Trade Policy Reform and Enhanced Trade Facilitation.
Component 1:  Trade Policy Reform
1. Tariff Rationalization: Tariff serves the dual purpose of revenue and protection. In an era of progressive trade liberalization, finding that balance is a challenge since all direct and indirect taxes are expected to be designed as such that it ensures maximum revenue mobilization and keeps the business incentive high. To this end, the project will support NBR to develop and implement sector-based roadmap/ timetable for tariff rationalization. 
2. Expansion of the Bonded Warehouse Facility to non-RMG exporting sectors: Bangladesh's customs bonded warehouse regime permits licensed manufacturers to import duty-free parts and materials required for their export production purposes. The project will support NBR to bring necessary regulatory and procedural changes and capacity to offer equitable bonded warehouse access to selected non-RMG priority sectors.  
Component 2: Enhanced Trade Facilitation
1. Implementation support for the New Customs Act: NBR is currently in the process of revising Customs Act 1969 in light of the Revised Kyoto Convention (RKC). The project will support NBR in drafting selected set of rules and regulations, e.g. risk management, valuation etc. The project will conduct awareness program on the new Act and regulations amongst the traders.
2. Policy and operational strategies for National Single Window for Trade:  As Bangladesh aims to have a trade single window, the project will support NBR to secure consensus amongst the key stakeholders, it will help NBR to have a blue-print document covering the key aspects of the single window implementation and to draft the NSW Law, which will be necessary for effective implementation and sustainability of the system.
3. Risk based Customs Control: Customs administrations are increasingly adopting risk management techniques to determine where the greatest areas of exposure to risk exist and how to effectively allocate scarce resources to manage these risks. The project will work closely with the NBR to prepare necessary strategic document for establishment of a dedicated Risk Management Directorate with its own organogram and HR policies, develop the specifications for the RM software along with capacity building of key risk management officials and develop the SRO and SOP on risk-based customs control. 
4. Implementation support for TRS-based reforms:  The project will support NBR to develop a prioritization document which identifies and highlights the reforms and recommendations to reduce time and cost to trade at the four Customs Houses as per TRS. The project will also assist NBR to develop the SOP for System-based TRS for continuous improvement at Customs.
5. WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement Implementation Support: The WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement suggests measures that require compliance by all border clearance agencies and necessary policy reform reflecting on their commitment and practice. Therefore, the project will support the Ministry of Commerce, the ministry responsible for trade, to develop a WTO TFA Implementation Action Plan with clear roles and responsibilities identified for all key implementation agencies. The project will also provide support to implement selected measures to reduce time and cost of trading and to NBR to develop a Customs Modernization Strategic Action Plan and an HR strategy to support the modernization initiatives to align with the WTO TFA.","","","","","",The overall objective of the project is to reduce the time and cost to trade and reduce anti-export bias in trade policy to ensure it supports export growth and diversification.

The Project will include two components:  
1.	Strengthen investors protection mechanism and increase transparency by closing the regulatory implementation gap;
2.	Develop competitive tourism value chain to increase private investments. 

In first component, the work will focus on improving investor retention and protection through strengthening the institutional set up and improve procedures for resolving investors grievances by developing recommendations on relevant changes into existing laws, regulations and procedures. The Project will also conduct a comprehensive legal analysis of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and Treaties with Investment Provisions (TIPs) negotiated by the Kyrgyz Republic and compare them with key elements of new generation of the similar treaties (IIAs). This will be followed by the support in preparing general guiding principles for negotiating effective IIAs and support the development of a checklist and elaboration of the key provisions and components of a model IIAs in line with global best practices.

The Project will assist in placing in the E-Registry as a priority those procedures related to tourism sector, and then devise a mechanism to continue the analyses and placing of all permits and administrative procedures in the inventory, to increase transparency of regulatory delivery.

In tourism component, the work will be organized on the sector level and target specific market segments (resulting from demand side market segmentation analysis) around five strategic pillars which address core obstacles to private sector growth and investment in the sector:
1. Filling the strategic prioritization and market positioning gap: The Project will conduct market research to understand which markets (and sub-segments) hold the most promise in terms of volume and revenue, which source countries generate the highest demand, what needs to be in place to attract these markets and improve local supply. Together with the client, select 1-2 market segments, and work with the client to prepare and implement an action plan to develop these market segments to address national goals. 
2. Enabling better air access and connectivity. 
3. Removing regulatory barriers. 
4. Targeted product development, investment outreach and servicing in the selected market segments (identified as a part of pillar 1 work). 
5. Facilitate access to finance for SMEs in tourism.","","","","","","The Project objective is to enhance SME resilience and support recovery from COVID-19 crisis.

Hence the topic features prominently in the Sustainable Development Goals, the World Bank Group's (WBG) Gender Strategy, and IFC's 3.0 strategy focused on creating markets where needed the most. 

In addition to governments, parents, and care providers, employers can also play a role in meeting their employees' care needs and supporting their continued employment and the well-being of their families. 

Since 2017, IFC has published a series of global and regional reports on the business case and good practices for employer-supported childcare. Building on this research, IFC's Global Tackling Childcare Advisory Program is a three-year program that works with companies across regions and sectors to facilitate the implementation of good family-friendly practices through advisory engagements and peer learning. The Program has helped companies conduct employee childcare needs assessments, develop and implement action plans, share knowledge, and measure and communicate the business case for investing in childcare so that they can continue making these investments.

The program also focuses on improving the enabling environment for employer-supported childcare in the 26 countries where, according to IFC's research,  employers are legally mandated to provide childcare. The program does this by:
 Conducting research to identify care demand and supply barriers and gauge employer readiness for legal compliance, and by bringing together public and private sector partners to discuss the business case and solutions to increase compliance. In addition, through market research, the program aims to identify investment opportunities in nascent care markets.
 Working with the World Bank, governments, and related entities to inform childcare policies.

The program is being implemented through a network of partners to enable knowledge-sharing, action, collaboration, and creation of new tools. This network includes: 
 An internal WBG-wide working group that meets regularly to collaborate, coordinate efforts, and develop joint public-private sector solutions for advancing childcare.
 The IFC-led peer-learning collaboration in Pakistan with 14 companies that have made commitments to become family-friendly employers by implementing policies such as childcare, flex work, paid parental leave, safe transport, and breastfeeding facilities. Many of these companies have already met their commitments. 
 The IFC-led Global Tackling Childcare Working Group of more than 30 organizations (for e.g., Goldman Sachs, the ILO, LEGO, OECD, Patagonia, UN Global Compact, UN Women, and UNICEF) and the Government of Paraguay. The group has developed a first-of-its-kind global guide for employer-supported childcare, covering topics such as childcare demand assessments, quality, hygiene, nutrition, safety, financial sustainability, and results measurement. The guide is available at www.ifc.org/tacklingchildcareguide

The program's regional scope includes ongoing work in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Egypt, Fiji, India, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Romania, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam. 

Follow this work on Twitter #TacklingChildcare and read various reports, case studies, and blogs here: www.ifc.org/tacklingchildcare","","","","","","In many parts of the world, formal childcare remains unaffordable, unavailable, and/or of poor quality, and women are still largely responsible for unpaid care, which negatively impacts their ability to enter and stay in the formal workforce. This can also lead to skill shortages and recruitment and retention challenges for employers, now and in future, which can negatively impact business and economic growth. The WBG Gender Strategy and the SDGs also highlight lack of childcare as a major barrier to women's access to more and better jobs. By tackling employer-supported childcare globally through this project and its five components, IFC aims to contribute to:

1) Enabling more companies in emerging markets to understand and meet their employees' childcare needs, become family-friendly employers, and realize better business outcomes. This can help advance employment opportunities for parents, particularly women, in the formal workforce and support their access to better, paid jobs by supporting their access to good quality and affordable employer-sponsored childcare. 
2) Helping companies to better measure and communicate the business case for their family-friendly policies so that they can continue investing in such policies, including childcare.
3) Strengthening markets for childcare by identifying investing potential in care and providing insights into care demand, supply, and policy frameworks in emerging markets, especially where employer-supported childcare is legally mandated.
4) Improving the enabling environment for childcare by advising governments and informing and improving policies that impact employer-supported childcare.
5) Providing global and regional platforms for companies to exchange knowledge of the business case and good practices for employer-supported childcare and inspire other companies to follow suit.

The childcare triple win - good for families, businesses, and economies - can help close gender gaps in employment and realize the WBG's twin goals of ending extreme poverty and increasing shared prosperity.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",603007,"","",Other,"",2019-03-16T04:00:00Z,2019-02-28T05:00:00Z

Studies show that financial exclusion inhibits human and physical capital accumulation, contributing to persistent income inequality and poverty. It has been a development objective for many years.

The project covers 4 components and has been designed to cover current gaps in achieving financial inclusion, complementing many projects related to financial inclusion being carried out by the WBG. 

COMPONENT 1: Support development of the NFIS 

Advancement of full financial inclusion requires a clear strategy that considers diverse needs of various population segments, as well as an effective implementation plan to manage a broad range of financial inclusion activities in the country. National Financial Inclusion Strategies (NFIS) are usually developed by National Banks to serve as key tools in achievement of these objectives. The project will support the National Banks of both Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in developing and rolling out their respective NFIS.

COMPONENT 2: Support local financial institutions in the development of innovative products informed by behavioral finance and build internal capacity through trainings.

The project will work with FIs at the sectoral level, using different approaches to develop better financial products, and improve their internal capability. Activities under this component go hand in hand with the work under component 3 with individuals, being mutually beneficial.

COMPONENT 3: The project will strengthen financial capability of clients and help them to make responsible financial decisions. This component is closely aligned to component 2 and will contribute to product innovations with partner FIs. 

COMPONENT 4: The project will strengthen and assess financial capability in Uzbekistan

To improve financial inclusion and behavior, people need to become financially more capable. There is a need to improve the skills, attitudes, and motivation of stakeholders. The classical process of knowledge-skills-behavior activities has proven to be ill equipped to tackle these issues. The project will focus specifically on influencing behavior, using key principles of behavioral economics, such as nudges and edutainment.

Component 1: Advisory work to upgrade quality assurance in healthcare facilities;
Component 2: Enhancing knowledge base and awareness on healthcare quality issues.

The assessment will typically indicate good practices in place, key shortcomings and priority remedial actions.   

Select clients that are interested in implementing Health care quality improvement program with IFC support will receive tailored advice based on priority areas identified by quality assessment. Implementation support may include training and workshops on improvement areas, ongoing consultations and a repeat assessment.

Component 2.

-	Development of training modules, manuals, principles and tools that can be used to promote quality of care, such as ethics, patient and family rights, medication management and use, quality improvement and patient safety, infection control, facility management and safety.
-	Development of case studies and/or reports. These knowledge management products will be based on client-level work undertaken in this project or experiences of the clients related to the effects of improvements in quality standards. 
-	Events (e.g., workshops, BBLs, webinars, etc.) and other dissemination activities to share case studies, best practices and lessons learned with IFC staff, clients, and other interested stakeholders to promote knowledge transfer and greater awareness of the tool and the broader quality agenda for the health sector.

The project will support the Federal and Provincial BOIs to improve and better target their investment promotion activities and provide services to investors (investor aftercare). It will also strengthen the coordination between Federal and Provincial BOIs to ensure that investor needs are addressed and investment attraction strategies are implemented effectively. This component will support the development and implementation of an effective client management system and improved investment promotion materials, including support for investment promotion website. 

Component 3: Supporting Investment in Priority Sectors 

This component will support investments in priority sectors by conducting several in-depth diagnostics aimed at identifying opportunities for creating markets through FDI attraction. The program will conduct a sector scan which is designed to identify the priority sectors to guide Pakistan's promotional efforts and to identify opportunities to create and develop new markets in the medium to long term. The sector scan will help evaluate the competitiveness for investment attraction of different economic sectors leveraging on private and public-sector inputs and existing data and studies. The sector scan will also identify regulatory constraints that affect Pakistan's potential for creating markets and hamper sectoral competitiveness and FDI.  This component will comprise of five related subparts: 

a) Developing sector targeted investment promotion plans
b) Establishing a PPD platform with public and private representatives of priority sectors
c) Recommendations on regulatory reform in priority sectors
d) Encourage women employment and entrepreneurship in targeted sectors","","","","","","The main objective of the project is to support implementation of investment promotion improvement and relevant investment climate reforms to catalyze investment in Pakistan by: 

i) the removal of regulatory barriers to business entry and operations at national and subnational level, so as to unlock investment and employment opportunities, including for youth and women;
ii) the increase in productivity of firms and labor, with initiatives including enhancing the linkages between firms at different stages of the productivity spectrum; these initiatives would also encompass foreign invested enterprises (FIEs); and
iii) enhancing government to business service delivery and improved investment promotion.   

In order to achieve these objectives, both the federal and provincial governments will be supported to build institutional capacity to address two goals that will contribute to improved competitiveness and investment:

- ongoing reform of existing policies, regulations and procedures; and
- improvement of investment promotion and investor relationship management.

This technical assistance will focus on promoting evidence-based impact monitoring and evaluation, structured public-private engagement and national-subnational inter-agency coordination.  These objectives will be addressed through activities under three thematic components, namely: 

i) Strengthening Investment Policy Framework and Supporting Investment Flows through Long-term Strategic Planning and Regulatory Reforms;
ii) Strengthening Investment Attraction and Investment Assistance Framework; and 
III) Supporting Investment in Priority Sectors.

Pakistan's Board of Investment (BOI) and Sindh Board of Investment (SBOI) are the main clients of the project.  Other provincial Boards of Investment in Pakistan will participate in the project. Project implementation at the federal will be coordinated through BOI.  Work at the sub-national level will be coordinated with the relevant Boards of Investment at the provincial level.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",602167,"","",Other,"",2018-08-20T04:00:00Z,2018-07-01T04:00:00Z

The market study will include a catalogue of main challenges to the feasibility of these projects and identify measures to address the challenges. The goal is not to carry out a detailed analysis of each flare site but to identify priority commercialization pathways and possible measures to reduce barriers. 

The scope of the study would include the following:
(i)	Current and future demand for, and prices of, end-products (electricity, methanol, fertilizers, other petrochemicals) or fuels that could be substituted (diesel, fuel oil, gasoline);
(ii)	Suitability in the Nigerian context of different proven technologies in commercial application that can convert flare gas into end products;
(iii)	Costs and other considerations at different stages along the supply chain, such as economies of scale, willingness and ability of potential consumers to pay, distance to and availability of large infrastructure, and risks that will reduce the commercial viability of projects;
(iv)	Net-back calculations based on end-product prices and costs incurred along the supply chain estimated in (iii) up to the custody transfer point; and
(v)	Market sounding with a range of stakeholders to obtain, amongst others, the following information: a) general perception among industry players regarding the NGFCP; b)  general feedback from the finance community regarding appetite to fund NGFCP projects and identify/quantify the main gaps that need to be mitigated; and c) input from original equipment manufacturers.

The study will prioritize projects based on the findings and calculate the financial rate of return and the maximum price of gas that can be offered, together with sensitivity analysis changing key assumptions (capital and operating expenditures, prices of gas or end-products being sold, the Nigerian/dollar exchange rate, and prices of competing goods and services where applicable).

As part of the market assessment, the consultant will undertake a consultation process with key stakeholders in the market first to collect data and information that will feed into their analysis.  A validation workshop will be organized by the consultant to share the preliminary findings with the various stakeholders and to gather feedback on the key findings. The consultant will use the feedback to revise and finalize the report.","","","","","","The expected development impact of this activity will be reduced gas flaring in Nigeria and economic development enabled by use of natural gas and natural gas liquids to meet currently unmet demand. Reduced flaring will contribute to local and global environmental improvement by reducing the emissions of harmful local air pollutants and greenhouse gases. Possibilities for economic use of natural gas benefitting Nigeria include distributed electricity generation for local communities, use of natural gas liquids to market liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for household use, and manufacture of fertilizers for agriculture. Extending access to electricity and LPG to those who are currently without these sources of energy, creating new jobs, and improving the air quality will enhance the welfare of Nigerians.

The study will support the commercialization of flare gas in Nigeria under the Nigeria Gas Flare Commercialization Program (NGFCP) recently launched by the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN), which targets elimination of routine gas flaring in Nigeria. It will catalyze the development of bankable projects for private-sector investors and project developers, and contribute to flare gas auctions to be carried out by the FGN, by filling knowledge and information gaps, focusing particularly on market solutions outside of the grid-based power sector.

Farmers struggle to find proper off takers and often accept low paddy prices due to their inability to effectively engage in their supply chain, and overall export levels remain below the country's potential.  

At the smallholder level, yields and farm practices are generally poor if compared to neighboring countries. Farmers lack access to technology, inputs, knowledge and finance. E&S performance is generally low and market dynamics are poorly understood, and generally farmers have poor business and financial management skills. At the industry level, millers and exporters still faces poor and inconsistent paddy quality from farmers, attributable to (i) limited access to improved quality seeds, (ii) a highly-fragmented rice industry with too many intermediaries leading to a significant loss in value and quality across the value chain; (iii) ineffective supply chain development of high value varieties and iv) limited access to affordable inputs services. These combined constraints prove a great challenge for commercial investors and regional and international rice players to provide long term funding and enter into the Cambodia rice market. 

The project aims to address these challenges through a combined lead firm approaches in partnership with international players and their key domestic partners.

The project also aims to enhance overall supply chain performance and increase revenues for private sector firms and smallholder farmers through improving productivity and climate resilience, building supply chain connectivity, adoption of new practices, technology and inputs, and increase farmers financial literacy.  

The project will be implemented in three and a half years in close collaboration with Mars and its domestic partner, BRICo. The engagement seeks to build smallholder farmers capacity and access to inputs, technology and information, and support their adoption of SRP practices.

The project expects to reach thousand of farmers by 2021 through the following specific objectives: (1) Increase access to SRP verified rice, including strengthening farmer groups/cooperatives and traceability; and (2) Improve farmers' adoption of technology climate smart agriculture practices including improve access to planting seeds and services.

SVIP,Advisory Services,"",Active,Africa,Malawi,"","",2019-05-02T04:00:00Z,"","","","The Government of Malawi has for many years intended to develop irrigated agriculture in the Lower Shire Valley, which is the poorest region in the country and is most severely affected by weather shocks. A number of studies have been prepared in the past, but the project never advanced beyond preliminary studies due to its cost and complexity and general disengagement of financiers from large-scale irrigation in the region in the 1980s. 
The Government requested support for the development from donors who responded with a joint AfDB/World Bank/IFC project identification mission in January 2011. The mission established several key principles to guide the design and implementation of the project, including that: the project would focus on commercial production, including smallholders in high value chains; professional management and PPPs to be pursued.
In cooperation with other donors the World Bank is now preparing a US$265.9 million project, of which IDA will fund US$160 million, for the development of SVIP.  The SVIP will fund the phased development of up to 42,500 ha of irrigation and drainage services associated with the proposed agricultural development.  The SVIP will initially cover 22,000 ha, of which over 12,000 ha are already developed and under commercial sugar cane production, mainly by Illovo where expensive electric-powered pumped irrigation will be replaced by gravity fed water from SVIP.  An additional 9,300 ha will be developed for new for irrigated agriculture.  Other components of the SVIP will fund smallholder-based agriculture modernization and commercialization and value chain support.
The SVIP as proposed by the WB is a 15-year program (2017-2032) structured around three coordinated pillars: (i) Providing reliable, professionally managed and sustainably-financed irrigation services to a large number of farmers in a phased construction, (ii) Supporting farmer organizations within a comprehensive land use plan; supporting land tenure strengthening and consolidation as well as natural resources management; and (iii) Establishing smallholder-owned commercial farm enterprises, supporting the transition from subsistence farming to commercial agriculture, and supporting the development of supply chains and access to markets.  IFCs involvement is with the first pillar only, the initial development and operation of the main irrigation infrastructure with a capital cost of approximately US$170 million.
The irrigation infrastructure will be located in the south of Malawi on the west bank of the Shire River. The first component is the development of the bulk water infrastructure through a gravity-fed network of over 60 km of primary canals. The primary canals will start at the intake at the existing Kapichira hydropower dam, which is operated by Escom, Malawis state-owned power utility. In order to ensure water availability for the SVIP, there will be no further development of the power generation capacity of Kapichira.  The primary canals will deliver bulk water to drinking-water treatment plants, to green-field irrigation projects (approximately 9,300 ha) and to the existing sugar cane farms: Illovo (about 10,000 ha); Kasinthula, Sande Ranch and Phata (about 2,180 ha in total).  Secondary canals will distribute water from the main canals to the different farms.

The proposed advisory project will be structured in two Components, each in two phases, the first phase providing advice on structural issues and the second phase assisting with implementing the agreed structure.   The scope of IFCs work will cover:
 - Component A: Commercial and legal structuring of the SVIP and associated WPAs.
 - Component B: Procurement of an incentive-based Management and Operations contract.","","","","","","The Government of Malawi (""GoM"") intends to develop the Shire Valley Irrigation Project (""SVIP"") with the support of the World Bank and other donors. GoM has decided that the major infrastructure assets should be publicly procured and owned but that the operation and maintenance (""O&M"") of the irrigation system should be managed through an incentive-based PPP arrangement.

Component I: Industrial parks sustainability and textile/ footwear sector reforms  The project will leverage the World Bank Groups ongoing engagements and dialogue on the Government's industrial parks and industrialization programs and carry out analysis to further drill down into the emerging challenges on environmental sustainability of the IPs and the selected sectors and identify regulatory and administrative gaps and constraints.  This component will have 4 areas of intervention:

1. Technical sector analysis of current environmental performance of selected industries The project will conduct research and survey existing investors in the industrial parks and assess the main challenges and concerns on competitiveness highlighting environmental and resource factors. This will include data on environmental performance and compliance, resource efficiency and common green infrastructure opportunities. The main focus will be on industrial parks, but solutions will also consider industries outside of industrial parks. This analysis will identify regulatory challenges, but also cost effective operating and technology solutions that sectors and industrial park operators can use to improve sustainability. 
2. Identify regulatory gaps for current status of regulations and performance of sector and suggestions for future changes - The country doesn't have a green manufacturing policy in place yet, even though there are new initiatives to develop green manufacturing strategy and policy. On the other hand, there are binding/stringent constraints in the current environmental strategy of Ethiopia at the Ministry of Environment which were enacted 20 years ago. These regulations are not adequate to respond to current realities and the Government's ambitious industrialization strategy. The project will assist GoE in the formulation of a structured policy for sustainable industrialization and help formulate compliance standards for sustainable manufacturing within industrial parks while still maintaining the sectors' global competitiveness. 
3. Development of sustainability action plan for industrial parks  Based on the technical analysis, the project will design sustainability action plans for selected industrial parks. GIZ has been developing a project to set up Environmental Social Management Framework at IPs. The project will coordinate with GIZ to give a comprehensive approach to GoE on addressing E&S related issues in IPs.
4. Sector sustainability roadmap Lastly, based on the technical analysis and benchmarking exercise and in consultation with private sector actors, the team will develop sector specific sustainability action plans for the textile and footwear sectors. This action plan will provide further details and prioritization of actions for the growth of these sectors. It will provide guidance on how these may be implemented in the industrial parks framework, and will be aligned with the sustainability action plan for the IPs.

Component II: Promoting sector sustainability and eco-industrial parks  Based on component 1 findings, the project will work together with government agencies, private sector, development partners and other stakeholders to help implement sustainability actions within the industrial parks and will include (I) Pilot implementation of actions in industrial parks; (ii) Potential for sustainable textile and footwear sectors and promotion of Ethiopia as a sustainable investment location;  and (iii) Where possible, the project will identify financing opportunities in the textile and footwear sectors and recommend potential investment vehicles to support investments in technologies and actions that support sustainability in IPs.","","","","","","Through a mix of targeted industry analysis and benchmarking work, the project will aim to help guide the textile and footwear industries into a sustainable development path with the implementation of a comprehensive green development interventions that will improve the sectors cost competitiveness, environmental sustainability, and Ethiopia's local and international standing.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",602203,"","",Other,"",2018-07-05T04:00:00Z,2018-07-01T04:00:00Z

Based on engagement and consultations with the key stakeholders and counterparts, the program comprises 4 components each of which addresses a critical challenge:
1. Business Regulation/Delivering Business Environment Reforms: 
South Africa's business environment, as measured by the annual DB Report has progressively worsened over the last few years [currently ranked 82/190 countries, South Africa was ranked 29 in 2007]. The continued retrogression, while making the creation of new businesses difficult, also feeds a narrative of poor Government to Business service and contributes to the private sector's reticence to invest and create jobs. 
Under this component, the program will support South Africa to achieve reforms in indicators that it has prioritized - Starting a Business, Trading Across Borders and Paying Taxes. 

2. Investment Policy & Promotion: 
In order to meet the objectives of the inter-Ministerial Committee (created by the Government to generate FDI), South Africa requires additional support to boost its ability to attract and retain FDI and to tap into supply and value chains in South Africa and elsewhere. InvestSA, which is South Africa's investment promotion agency does not presently have the requisite capacity and has requested technical support to lead South Africa's drive to reshape its economy.

Further to a request from DTI, technical support rendered under this component will include:
(a) Development of an Investment Reform Map (IRM) and a Systematic Investment Retention Mechanism (SIRM). The IRM process helps countries clarify their investment objectives and yields a comprehensive review of policy, institutional, legal and regulatory barriers to FDI that generates a blue print for reform. 
(b) Strengthening of Capacity for Investment Promotion: A fundamental factor for the success of the IPP component would be strengthening of the Investment Promotion and aftercare services capacity of InvestSA. 
(c) Technical Support for Investment Generation into Industrial Parks.
(d) Review of Government Policy on linkages and local supplier development with particular reference to BBBEE: The team will work closely with the DTI at the national level as well as with 1-2 provincial/city level counterparts focusing on specific Industrial Park initiatives in order to meet the objectives of the Industrial Policy Action Plan 2017/18 - 2019/20. 

3. Competition Policy/Market Regulation Reform: 
This component supports the development of a holistic approach to competition policy in SA which aims to support the alignment of government interventions in markets (laws and regulations, broader public policies and direct state participation) with principles that strengthen market competition. The program will support the development of tools to strengthen the enforcement of the competition law to allow competition authorities to use their resources to detect and sanction anticompetitive behavior more effectively. It will also focus on broadening of the scope of competition policy in South Africa and equip policy makers with mechanisms to identify and reform distortions to competition caused by government interventions in markets in order to support entry and competition in key sectors of the economy. 

4. Private Sector Diagnostics and Analysis: 
The program will undertake a Country Private Sector Diagnostic and sector scans to identify key private sector investment opportunities to develop backwards and forward linkages. The said diagnostic and sector scans will also be undertaken with an analytical lens that will seek to identify the principal growth constraints of small and young businesses.","","","","","","The 4-year Program aims at addressing key investment and growth challenges facing the South African economy such as poor regulation, anti-competitive practices and negative investor perceptions. It will focus on a range of horizontal and vertical sectoral reforms with special attention to SMEs. The Program seeks to contribute to addressing the unemployment and poor economic growth that the South Africa National Development Plan (NDP) 2030 identifies as key development challenges. The Project will be further calibrated to reflect findings from Country Private Sector Diagnostics and an Enterprise Survey both of which will identify sector specific investment opportunities and obstacles. 

Projected impact under the Program components are:

1. Business Regulation: 
(a) 10% reduction in compliance costs and time to comply for Starting a Business, Paying Taxes and Trading across Borders Doing Business indicators; 
(b) Sector specific regulatory reforms in sectors identified by Private Sector Diagnostic/Sector Scans and Enterprise Survey (due in 2018) where RSA has competitive advantages in generating investment.

2. Investment Policy and Promotion:
(a) A blueprint for reform and at least one reform each to address current policy, institutional, legal and regulatory barriers to FDI; 
(b) Design and deployment of an institutional reform strategy for investment promotion; 
(c) Design and deployment of an investor-State conflict management mechanism that will enable the GoSA and investors to address any grievances well before they escalate into full blown legal disputes; 
(d) A national strategy on investment promotion, including generation of investment into Industrial Parks; 
(e) Review of Government Policy on linkages and local supplier development.

3. Competition Policy/Market Regulation: 
(a) Identification of policy and regulatory obstacles to entry and competition in 2 sectors; 
(b) Design tools to strengthen competition law enforcement and advocacy by the Competition Authorities; 
(c) Deployment of an evidence-based engagement framework on competition issues in order to support advocacy to address barriers to competition

4. Private Sector Diagnostics and Analysis: 
(a) Identification of key opportunities for promoting private sector investment through the Country Private Sector Diagnostic and Sectors Scans.

With this enhanced rainfall data, we can address one of the prevailing challenges identified by the financial and insurance market in fostering and enhancing the development of sustainable parametric (weather index) insurance products through the provision of this required data.

The proposed R&D would benefit from the established infrastructure of the LA project by enhancing this systems monitoring capability with sensors to monitor and capture rainfall data (in addition to the radiation and temperature data already being collected on a real time basis).

To achieve this objective the project structured into 2 phases:

Phase 1: Technical development of Monitoring devices connected to the solar panels
Traditional rain gauges are expensive and due to their design not fraud free. It is therefore interesting to develop a simple rain monitoring system that is less fraud prone and can be incorporated into PV modules. 

To develop the rainfall sensor system on PV modules, the project (R&D) will test the different available sensors and install them on a test PV panel, and compared with measurements achieved using a standard rain-gauge. This will enable the project to correlate the new measurement system with standard systems in order to assess the quality of data that can be obtained.

Phase 2: Business model and Data dissemination
a) larger pilot test roll out in multiple locations & countries; b) developing a business plan for commercialization of Rain Sensors to be installed with PV Panels; c) formalizing a partnership with the LA project and its suppliers (of PV Solar Panels) for installation of Rain Sensors;
d) finalizing the data collection and data sharing protocols in consultation with the LA Project, which is currently collecting data on temperature and radiation from sensors installed on the PV Solar panels; e) Develop a portal dedicated for weather (rainfall and temperature) data sharing.","","","","","","The objective of this proposed R&D is to test and ultimately implement a practical & cost effective way to integrate rain-sensors, to measure rainfall/precipitation, currently available in the market to the roof-top solar energy panel systems that are being rolled out in many countries and regions globally including the Lighting Africa project (LA project).
