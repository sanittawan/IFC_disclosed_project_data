It represents the best practice learnings of the Lighting Africa pilot. Building on the success of the Lighting AFrica pilot, IFC is replicating
 
 the Kenya pilot across AFrica (in partnership with the World Bank) and into Asia and MENA. 
 
As IFC expands its work in this area, the activities which are common across all country programs are coordinated and managed through Lighting Global. These
 include 
 the product quality assurance function, the support for a self-sustaining industry association (GOGLA), collaborative relationships with global industry, multi-lateral, and NGO partners, and efforts to establish with the industry end-of-product
 life recylcing 
 and disposal systems to address the new waste stream created by proliferation of solar devices. 
 
Central to Lighting Global will be a strategy of building the institutions in the market which can take on the roles that IFC has played

As the foundation for these country programs, Lighting Global supports the following development impacts:
-- access to modern lighting services;
-- health benefits related to reduced indoor air pollution exposure from open flame kerosene wick lamps, as well as reduced injuries and deaths from fire associated with open wick kerosene lantern use;
-- increased productivity for school children and from working adults able to be productive at night;
-- economic savings from reduced kerosene purchases and cell phone charging services resulting in the ability to step further up the energy ladder by acquiring more advanced solar kits with extended energy services (fans, multiple lights, multiple phone charging, radio, TV)

As the off-grid lighting market matures, Lighting Global supports the transition of the industry to full self-sufficiency by supporting the industry association (GOGLA) to take on industry support roles currently played by IFC, and by transitioning the market to a self-sustaining product quality assurance function which does not rely on IFC into the future.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",600173,"","",Sustainable Business Advisory,"",2013-12-05T05:00:00Z,""

A lack of cold storage may results in post-harvest losses of an estimated 20%-40% of production, in spoilage by the time produce reaches urban consumers, and exclusion from key export markets such as Russia where grocery stores are raising standards for quality of supply. Moreover, absent cold storage, farmers must sell their produce immediately upon harvest which results in gluts, depressed prices and seasonality; perishable foodstuffs is not available at certain times of year unless they are imported or grown in greenhouses. All this has far-reaching consequences in a country where agriculture accounts for 23% of GDP and 48% (2012) of employment. Direct positive impacts of improvements in the supply chain include increased exports, higher incomes for farmers, reduced seasonality of supply and pricing for consumers, and creation of new semi-skilled jobs.  Indirect positive impacts will relate to overall improving of business environment, introduction of advanced agricultural technologies and techniques, and improved food safety. 

There is considerable scope to strengthen the agricultural value chains by removing constraints and demand and supply. On the supply side, low farm productivity limits the marketed surplus, and farmer capacity to market this surplus is constrained by inexperience with market activity and low economies of scale. IBRD reports that only one-third of farmers sell any of their output and of those who do only 15% (5% of all farmers) sell in the national market or export internationally. On the demand side low access to credit, weak market links, and barriers to entry and expansion all constrain demand of processors for agricultural commodities. Processors struggle to secure a reliable supply of raw material, lack investment capital and knowledge of food safety standards.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",600076,"","",Public-Private Partnerships Transaction Advisory,"",2014-05-20T04:00:00Z,""

Africa Leasing Facility II,Advisory Services,"",Completed,Africa,Africa Region,"","",2014-05-15T04:00:00Z,"","","","According to the World Bank, eighteen of the thirty-six countries it classifies as 'fragile and conflict-affected' are in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although most such countries enjoy an immediate jump in economic activity following the end of hostilities, sustained
 
 progress is more difficult, and many nations continue to suffer from collapsed legal and regulatory structures, marginalization of smaller businesses, lack of basic infrastructure and deterioration of financial services. 

In this context, leasing can
 help 
 build a sustainable private sector by addressing the constraints suffered by small businesses, which often lack access to finance, market and networking opportunities. Over the past four years, IFC's first Africa Leasing Facility project successfully
 facilitated 
 leasing reforms in 15 countries including Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The objective of this follow-on Africa Leasing Facility project is to facilitate increased access to finance for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in
 these countries 
 under ALF II by developing a sustainable leasing infrastructure in each. Specifically, in the program countries the project aims to:
- Help promote relevant legislative and regulatory reforms;
- Contribute to the increase of leasing transactions,
 
- Increase 
 access to financial services by helping micro, small and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) gain access to leasing knowledge and information to finance their equipment needs;
- Advise banks and other financial institutions on leasing issues,
 and 
- Implement 
 a leasing advisory exit strategy for each country.","","","","","","IFC's model for leasing development has been designed to adapt to the diverse and evolving market needs of small businesses. Specific country interventions will be developed according to pre-identified market demand following stakeholder consultation. Interventions will seek regional outreach in economic zones where there is potential for higher investment mobilization and higher development impact.

Africa Leasing Facility II (ALF II)  will evolve around three core components:
1. Entry-level AS: addressing legislative and supervision/regulatory constraints for leasing, including tax issues, in addition to implementing a broad public education campaign.

2. Value-added AS: broadening the range of AS to match the needs of the market, through the adoption of a more flexible menu of potential interventions. ALF II intends to work more closely with its clients and customize its AS through the establishment of partnerships with one or several established leasing companies in the region, North Africa or South Asia. Such technical partners provide leasing know-how and financing options. Tailored solutions would be sought to assist new and existing financial and non-financial lessors to enter the leasing market through appropriate commercial, marketing and risk management strategies; the development of specific leasing tools and procedures; and the building of lasting relationships with equipment suppliers. Also, leasing policies and processes will be introduced for the financing of secondary market equipment needs.

3. Mobilization of investment capital: ALF II will focus on and continue to support the development of long-term financing solutions and sustainable ways of accessing long-term financing by:
- facilitating financing opportunities to at least one bank or non-bank lessor per country with the implementation of one AS project linked to IFC's investment pipeline and financed at 50/50 cost shared;
- providing market intelligence through annual market studies, business development activities, organizing investment forums and exploring potential IFC investments.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",598807,"","",Access To Finance,"",2014-03-25T04:00:00Z,""

Niger Irrigation,Advisory Services,"",Completed,Africa,Niger,"","",2014-07-18T04:00:00Z,"","","","Niger is one of three African countries selected to participate in the World Bank managed Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR). Under the PPCR, US$50 million in grant finance and US$60 million in concessional loan finance is available to fund the

 
 interventions detailed in Niger's Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR). The IFC and the private sector arm of the African Development Bank are responsible for the private sector interventions within Niger's SPCR.

Niger is a dry country that
 is
 
 predicted to get drier with climate change. Increased access to improved irrigation will make Niger's agricultural sector more resilient to climate change and enhance food security for the country. Hence it is critically important that the agricultural
 sector
 
 in Niger adopts improved irrigation techniques. Improved irrigation technologies will improve productivity and lead to the efficient use of the country's scarce water resources. It will also enable farmers in Niger to protect their crops and livelihoods
 despite
 
 longer dry seasons and unexpected weather events (such as heat waves).

In 2012, the IFC conducted an in-depth market study with PPCR grant finance to investigate opportunities for private sector investment in improved irrigation systems. The
 proposed Niger
 
 Irrigation Project will test and implement the recommendations from the IFC study in a two-phased approach. 

Phase I comprises an Advisory Services (AS) program to test the financial viability of commercializing improved irrigation systems
 by the private
 
 sector to farmers in Niger. The program will facilitate access and adoption of these systems by farmers in Niger and aims to increase agricultural productivity of farmers and strengthen farmers resilience to climate change. 

Pending
 the success of Phase
 
 I, a second phase will comprise investments and associated AS programs to scale up private sector investments in improved irrigation systems in Niger. The results of Phase I will inform the investment structures that will be used
 in Phase II. The rationale
 
 for the two-phased approach is that market conditions do not currently exist to provide irrigation equipment on a fully commercial basis.
 
The specific components of the program are: 

1. Competitive selection of a lead
 agricultural input firm to provide
 
 irrigation equipment to small and medium sized farmers in Niger, and provision of support to the firm in the expansion of its irrigation business in the country to reach farmers.

2. Providing of training to farmers
 on financial management as well as on
 
 the installation and use of improved irrigation systems and associated inputs (e.g. greenhouses, hybrid seeds, fertilizers and pesticides).

3. Facilitate increased access to markets for farmers participating in
 the program.","","","","","","The goal of the Niger Irrigation Project is to promote private sector investments in irrigation in Niger.  A private firm (the client) interested to conduct business in the irrigation sector in Niger will be selected through a competitive bidding process.  IFC funds under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience will then be used to finance the training of farmers and to partially cover the costs of irrigation equipment used in the program during the pilot period.  The farmers will be trained by the client to use the improved irrigation equipment and to manage their finances with regards to the purchase of the irrigation equipment.  The IFC will work with the client to design appropriate training methods as well as structures for private sector financing of irrigation equipment.  If successful, the project is expected to subsequently facilitate access to irrigation equipment for farmers in Niger through private sector financing.

The client will provide initial training on relevant technology, agronomy and finance to a group of select farmers. Farmers will be selected for training and may receive finance based on their skills and commitment to the program. These farmers will serve as demonstration of the technical and financial feasibility of the proposed interventions. 

The project will track results via the number of farmers that receive training, and the number of farmers that purchase, install and operate irrigation equipment as a result of the project.  The project will also track the number of hectares under imporved irrigation, and the agronomy results for the farmers, including increases in producitvity and reduction in water use.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",600247,"","",Sustainable Business Advisory,"",2014-03-03T05:00:00Z,""

The situation is even more acute in rural areas with only 16% grid access rates. In addition, 40% of the population is 'under-electrified' i.e. having less than
 
 12 hours of grid power per day.

The WBG through the Lighting Africa Program in Nigeria aims to increase access to better, cleaner and safer off-grid lighting to the rural populations not connected to the grid. The program will accelerate the development
 
 of the markets for modern off-grid lighting products. 

The program will accomplish this by undertaking a number of market development activities:
-Market Intelligence: to help product marketers and distributors understand the new off-grid lighting market
 
 segment, supply and distribution chains. The insights from the research serve to inform their business and strategic plans.
-Quality Assurance: promoting the adoption of Lighting Global quality standards across the sector to counter the risk of market
 spoilage 
 from the infiltration of low quality products that erodes confidence in the new off-grid technologies among consumers, financiers and stakeholders.
-Access to finance: Adequate financing along the entire supply chain has been identified as being
 critical 
 for the growth of the off-grid lighting market. The program will develop financing facilities through financial institutions to meet the demand from the market.
-Consumer Education: creating awareness, for a market to grow and thrive, consumers
 must know 
 what products are available and understand the value and benefits of these products over what the consumers are currently using (kerosene and candles). Consumers must also be able to distinguish between good and poor quality products in order
 to get good value 
 for their scarce resources. 
-Business Development Support: provide a range of market and business development support activities directly to manufacturers, distributors and retailers under this component with the objective of fostering
 competition and creating 
 a vibrant and competitive market that will extend distribution to the rural areas.","","","","","","With 20 million Nigerians using kerosene as their primary source of lighting, the program seeks to accelerate the development of markets for clean off-grid lighting products .

Currently, investors need to wait for a period of at least 334 days in order to get a construction permit.
 
 Alternatively, they need to pay bribes to speed up the process. This situation discourages local and foreign investors and gives way to corruption. There is a pressing need to eliminate unnecessary delays, reduce corruption in issuing permits, and increase
 
 investor interest in the construction sector through the reform and simplification of construction permit issuing process within Kabul Municipality. By establishing a streamlined permit process, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA)
 
 seeks to reduce corruption in this priority area as a step towards transparent institutions dealing with the private sector. In 2012, Transparency Internationals Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) ranked Afghanistan 174 out of 176 countries. Several obstacles
 
 cited by Afghan businesspeople, including access to land, the construction permit issuance process, anti-competitive behavior and tax administration are closely related to corruption.

The objective of this project is to develop a simplified yet effective
 
 construction permit system and regulatory framework that would improve the governments capacity and efficiency in issuing construction permits. By doing so, the private sector will benefit from a reduced burden and cost at the national and sub-national
 levels, 
 through the elimination of the CP bottleneck, which hampers the capacity of the growing Housing Sector in Afghanistan to meet the demand gap. A streamlined CP process would also minimize opportunities for corruption thanks to an improved and increasingly
 transparent 
 process. This would serve as a foundation for boosting the ease of doing business and investors perception. The new CP framework will also establish the framework for the GIRoA to retroactively formalize unpermitted buildings. The project aims
 to reduce the 
 time it takes to obtain construction permits and to improve the capacity of the civil servants operating the CP process. Changes are expected to increase both the efficiency and capacity of the Kabul Municipality to issue construction permits
 and, hence, increase 
 applications under the reformed permits system. In addition, expected savings to the private sector, as a result of the improved system, would be achieved over the longer term of the project.

 support to:
- Implement

Approach: The main approach will be to work through lead firms (LFs)
 
 in the agribusiness sector that are disposed to taking risks, but see the opportunities to promote climate smart agriculture in project areas. The LF approach involves working directly with identified companies to strengthen their supply chain, ability
 to 
 provide products and services in markets with high demand, and improve their organizational capacity. Three LFs will be engaged in the pilot phase and optimally two additional LFs will be engaged to scale-up activities. 

Interventions should also
 result 
 in viable business models in terms of adoption of climate resilient farming practices, climate change risk management capacity of the private sector (including farming communities); market linkages established at input and output levels.

Amongst the different policy measures, energy efficiency standards & labeling program offer significant potential for energy demand reduction and energy cost savings, reducing risk from energy price changes and providing non-energy benefits such as promoting market competitiveness, and building the capacity of the local manufacturing sector. A standards & labeling program has the potential to initiate market transformations for different classes of energy-saving equipment at a cost below the cost of providing new energy supply/conventional fuel supply.

As well, the project aims to increase the availability and use of energy efficient technologies to meet growing market demand, by identifying which technologies have the greatest potential in Egypt, what barriers are preventing industry's use of these technologies, their availability, as well as the manufacturing of these technologies in Egypt.  The activities will look to leverage Egypt's competitive advantages to attract investment and identify how local feeding industries could play a greater role in manufacturing.","","","","","","The objective of this project is to strengthen the Ministry of Trade, Industry, & SMEs implementation capacity to encourage energy efficient practices in industries by establishing an energy efficiency standards & labelling program for industrial electric motors to catalyze uptake in the sector.  The project will also support increasing access to clean technologies through policies to encourage the development of local manufacturing and services for clean technologies.

This project will aim to achieve the following outcomes:
- Development of minimum energy performance standards for energy efficient (EE) motors, 
- Development of labelling system for EE motors, 
- Development of a monitoring verification & enforcement mechanism,
- Improve policies and regulatory framework to encourage investment in clean technologies, 
- Policies enacted that support clean technology adoption.

The project will result in the following impacts:

Cities are a major contributor to both a country's economic well-being, but also a significant source of Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The ECA Cities Platform will support cities to develop a larger pool of implementable and bankable high impact projects that will help cities to become more competitive and sustainable.

The project aims to move cities from ad-hoc development of individual projects to the adoption of a more strategic approach to urban planning and infrastructure project development. Currently, many projects developed by cities are not fit for international financing by banks and fail to attract private sector investments. IFC will support selected cities throughout project planning and development and jointly develop at least six urban infrastructure projects in the areas of water and wastewater, public transport, district heating or solid waste treatment that will be appropriate for further financing and/or the development of public private partnerships.","","","","","","By supporting cities to upgrade and expand their infrastructure and services, IFC will generate a high development impact on several dimensions and improve citizens general well-being.

2030 Water Resources Group Africa,Advisory Services,"",Completed,Africa,Kenya,"","",2016-06-08T04:00:00Z,"","","","2030 WRG is a public-private-civil society partnership, established in 2008. The objective of 2030 WRG is to accelerate water reforms and generate action to ensure water does not become a barrier to economic growth, while ensuring long-term environmental and social sustainability.

In Africa, the current focus countries for 2030 WRG are South Africa (since late 2011), Tanzania (since late 2013), and Kenya (since mid 2014). Country selection has been demand-driven (i.e. via a high level invitation from the government). The scale of water security issues, and presence of 2030 WRG partners in-country, have also influenced the geographic focus.

SOUTH AFRICA
The 2030 WRG engagement in South Africa began in late 2011. With the analysis phase completed, Multi-Stakeholder Platform established (Strategic Water Partners Network), and priority projects identified, the priority over the next two years will be to ensure that this foundation translates into meaningful impacts. The focus for project
development will be in three areas:

1. Water efficiency and leakage reduction. Under this group the primary focus will remain municipal water supply systems. To reduce these losses, 2030 WRG will support the roll out of the No Drop reform program and the development of specific, financially viable water loss reduction projects, including via the testing of the Performance Based Contract toolkit.

2. Effluent and wastewater management. The focus under this working group is mine water management. The first objective will be to establish the institutional and economic viability of mine wastewater reuse PPP projects at catchment and/or mine levels. The Witbank catchment has been selected as a test case.

3. Agricultural and supply chain water. Expected focus topics include (i) the upgrading of the national Water Administration System (bulk irrigation scheduling system), and (ii) use of PPPs for the rehabilitation of large scale irrigation systems. A further objective (which applies to all countries) is to increase high level awareness of water security risks, opportunities, and the benefits of public-private collaboration. Results in this area will be tracked via tailored surveys (see Evaluation Plan section) and other standard indicators, e.g. media appearances, publications, etc (refer planned communications plan, as above).

TANZANIA
2030 WRG has been active in Tanzania since late 2013. With 2,300 cubic meters of water per capita, Tanzania has a relative abundance of water resources at an aggregate level. However, with extremely low level of water storage capacity, and high annual and seasonal rainfall variability, the country faces major constraints in securing sufficient water, in particular for agricultural development.

Indicative planned initiatives include:

- Expanding access to efficient irrigation systems for
emerging/smallholder farmers through aggregated access to finance and awareness raising
- Development of new public-private water stewardship initiatives in high water competition watersheds.

KENYA
Kenya is home to some of the great water towers of East Africa (Mt Kenya, the Aberdares), yet 90 percent of the country is either arid or semi-arid. At an aggregate level, annual renewable freshwater supply is only 650 m3 per capita, well below the threshold for chronic water scarcity. Early 2030 WRG analysis suggests that the scale of planned development, especially irrigation, could lead to a 29% water gap in 2030 unless substantial supply- and demand-side investments are made.

The immediate priorities for Kenya are to: (i) generate further interest and awareness on the water agenda and the concept of a Kenya 2030 WRG partnership, (ii) fully establish the multi-stakeholder platform; and (iii) agree on working group priorities and specific projects/initiatives to develop under the partnership.","","","","","","This program aims to reduce the water demand-supply gap in select countries in Africa, currently focusing on South Africa, Tanzania and Kenya.

The success of this program will be assessed against:

- New instruments/solutions catalyzed through Multi Stakeholder Platforms (MSPs) and under implementation through third-parties
- Partnerships: MSPs operational with established governance
- Knowledge Development: Development of robust and scientific data and info, incorporating hydro-economic cost-, benefit- and risk-based analysis, to guide the development of solutions

Instruments/solutions will include the launch of new financial products and structures (including via PPPs and other models), new third-party projects (e.g. for new technology uptake), and the enactment of policies, regulations, incentives, and institutional/governance reforms.

Impacts will vary by country according to the specific solutions prioritized by the MSPs, but will always fall within the following four physical impact categories:

- Reduced fresh water abstraction (cubic meters/ year)
- Increased cost-effective water storage (cubic meters)
- Increased agricultural water productivity (project level production ($)/ m3 used)
- Reduced discharge of untreated waste water / polluted water (cubic meters/ year)

To measure the impact on improved water resource management policies and governance, a """"water governance score"""" is included as an additional key impact indicator.

Although national governments serve as the primary clients for 2030 WRG, this program will convene private sector, in addition to governments and civil society, as key actors for implementation, and leverage the strengths of the private sector as a solution provider and innovator.

Note: the mandate of 2030 WRG is to act as a catalyst, but priority projects will be identified and implemented through the MSPs. Hence the choice of which projects / instruments / solutions are develop is influenced by, but outside the direct control of, this project.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",600830,"","",Cross-Industry Advisory Services,"",2015-07-27T04:00:00Z,""

The program covers activities in line with the 2030 Water Resources Groups (2030 WRG) A-C-T approach of operation:

 (1) Analysis - Developing hydro-economic analysis to highlight the macro water issues and catalyze water sector transformation and collective action; 
(2) Convening - Bringing together public & private sectors, community organizations, development agencies and international organizations in structured discussions for identifying solutions for water resources management through Multi-Stakeholder Platforms and identified workstreams for engagement; 
(3) Transformation - Implementing/ enacting policy, incentives, technical, financial, or governance-related water solutions through local stakeholders.

The choice of priorities and initiatives to champion are determined by the Multi-Stakeholder Platform. 

2030 WRG does not itself implement the identified solutions on the ground. However, it enables the formation of partnerships, identification of implementing entities, and unlocking of funding, in tandem with the members of its Multi-Stakeholder Platforms, so that implementation can be carried out effectively. 

Current program for South Asia covers four engagements  Ganga/ Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Bangladesh.

GANGA/ UTTAR PRADESH:
The Ganga/ U.P. engagement focuses on pollution reduction and water use efficiency:
(a) Municipal & Industrial Wastewater Treatment and Reuse:  (1) Improving the enabling conditions for wastewater treatment and reuse models, and/or (2) area-based wastewater treatment action plans (e.g., Hindon river). 
(b) Agri Water Use Efficiency and Non-Point Source Pollution Reduction: Implementation of good agricultural practices & technologies for area-specific action (e.g., Hindon) covering defined stretches of the river. 

KARNATAKA 
At the request of the Karnataka state government, 2030 WRG has been involved in Karnataka since 2010 to tackle its growing water problems, which are impacting the Krishna and Cauvery river basins, the state's largest and most economically significant basins.

The Karnataka engagement focuses on:
- Agri Water Efficiency: Facilitation of implementation roadmap and financing for technology use in agriculture. 
- Wastewater Reuse Opportunities in Urban-Industrial Settings.

MAHARASHTRA
2030 WRG's Maharashtra engagement was initiated in 2014 to focus on the agriculture sector and grow the state at 4% or more agri-GDP with the same or reduced water consumption. Key planned activities include:
- Technology acceleration in agriculture: Interventions for watershed development and on-farm efficiency in the agriculture sector. 
- Urban-industrial water and wastewater management: Circular economy solutions and improvements to the enabling environment. 

BANGLADESH: 
2030 WRG initiated its Bangladesh engagement in 2013 on the basis of interest expressed by government, industry, and research institutes for its analytical studies. 
Key focus areas include:
- Water Governance: Recommendations for policy reform, institutional capacity building, access to green finance, and improved governance. 
- Greater Dhaka Watershed (GDW) Restoration: Wastewater treatment, and aquifer & wetlands management.
- Agri-Water Efficiency: Introduction of water-efficient practices & technologies, innovative financing mechanisms, and market linkages.","","","","","","The program aims to reduce the water demand-supply gap in select areas, currently covering the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh/ Ganga in India, as well as Bangladesh.

2030 Water Resources Group LAC,Advisory Services,"",Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Peru,"","",2016-07-15T04:00:00Z,"","","","Background:
2030 WRG is a public-private-civil society partnership, established in 2008. The 2030 WRG represents the coming together of a consortium of corporates, IFC, the World Economic Forum, the UN, individual governments, and international agencies, to elevate water up the global agenda. The objective of 2030 WRG is to accelerate water reforms and generate action to ensure water does not become a barrier to economic growth, while ensuring long-term environmental and social sustainability.
In LAC, the current focus countries for 2030 WRG are Peru (since 2013) and Mexico (since late 2010).  2030 WRG is now scoping new countries in LAC; if a country with a suitable hydro-economic-political context is identified, a third country programme will be started.  Possible countries include Brazil, or Colombia.
Activities under the Project:
PERU:
(1) Economic Incentives for the Efficient Use of Water:
This group will work with the National Water Authority, SUNASS and other government regulatory authorities to develop policies, regulations and economic incentive structures that make water users use water more efficiently; reducing their water footprint; polluting less; and recycling water more. The outputs for this work may be new regulations or best practices adopted by the government; voluntary codes of conduct by industry sectors; or the more effective and widespread communication, implementation and enforcement of current incentives, as appropriate.
(2) Public Private Partnerships for Sustainable Catchment Management
This group will work to streamline the processes by which public-private-civil society alliances can be developed in Peru.  Its strategic outputs could be new regulations, processes or guidelines to facilitate the development of such alliances.
(3)  Innovative Financial Solutions for Water Resources Projects.
2030WRG is working in partnership with the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) and the members of Working Group 3 to develop new financial mechanisms to attract more financial resources into Perus water sector.

This group will map and recommend innovative financial mechanism that could be adopted by Peru, leveraging government funds with private capital, to deliver much needed priority water resources projects.  Specific outputs could be new regulations approved by the Government of Peru (eg the Ministry of Finance) to permit a new investment mechanism.
MEXICO:
Activities under the Project:
1.	Carry out Analytical Work, developing of a tool to prioritise Conagua's investment portfolio, in a transparent and inclusive manner, and applying that tool to 3 hydrological regions of Mexico.
2.	Commission a study to identify key opportunities for 2030WRGs private sector partners to invest in the Mexican Water Sector, and how the enabling environment for such investments can be optimized
3.	Setting up of a Multistakeholder platform in Mexico with Working Groups to identify scope and implement projects that close the national water gap. One possibility is to collaborate with the existing Water Advisory Council (Consejo Consultiva del Agua, CCA), an influential body already convening certain groups of water users to tackle water scarcity challenges in the country.
THIRD COUNTRY:
Initial scoping activities started in July 2015, with a consultant familiar with the water sector in LAC and experienced in WBG water management initiatives reviewing the current landscape of these countries.","","","","","","This program aims to reduce the water demand-supply gap in select countries in Latin America, currently focusing on Peru & Mexico & Brazil.

Key outcomes from the program that address the identified market barriers will include: (1) launch of new financial products & structures (eg including economic incentives, multi-stakeholder alliances & other models) catalyse new investment in the sector (2) increase in water efficiency through the enactment of policies, regulations, incentives, & institutional/ governance reforms, (3) generation of new water resource information & increased awareness of water resource solutions, and building relationships with hosts to unlock current projects that are stalled.

The program aims to facilitate:
- New instruments/solutions catalyzed through MSPs & under implementation through third-parties
- Partnerships: MSPs operational with established governance structures
- Knowledge Development: Development of robust / scientific data & info, incorporating hydro-economic cost-benefit & risk-based analysis, to guide the development of solutions

Instruments/solutions will include new financial products & structures (eg including economic incentives, multi-stakeholder alliances & other models), new third-party projects (e.g. new technology uptake), & enactment of policies, regulations, incentives, & institutional/governance reforms. Impacts will vary by country according to the specific solutions prioritized by the MSPs, but will always fall within the following 5 impact categories:
- Reduced fresh water abstraction (cubic meters/ year)
- Increased cost-effective water storage (cubic meters)
- Increased agricultural water productivity (sector GDP ($)/ m3 used)
- Reduced discharge of untreated waste water / polluted water (cubic meters/year)
- Increased investment by a water-using sector (eg agriculture, mining, industry, realty) unlocked by the resolution of a water-related bottleneck.

To measure the impact on improved water resource management policies & governance, a """"water governance score"""" is included as an additional key impact indicator. A methodology for this indicator will be developed in time for inclusion in the first PSR cycle.

While governments serve as the primary clients for 2030 WRG, this program convenes private sector, in addition to governments & civil society, as key actors for implementation, & leverage the strengths of the private sector as a solution provider & innovator.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",600870,"","",Cross-Industry Advisory Services,"",2015-09-14T04:00:00Z,""

They will also be better prepared to respond to the needs and challenges that may arise from the mining by effectively and responsibly investing the royalties they will receive. 

The aim of the project is to help municipalities improve their governance and empower local leaders so that they can effectively invest the royalties in their communities. The idea is to provide them with a framework so that their discussions are around the needs, challenges and opportunities that mining brings to their localities. Finally,  these tools will set the ground for a real transformation triggered by the presence of mining companies in the region.

The project design has been structured around governance  improvement responding to the following 3 aspects: 
- Responsiveness: Municipalities deliver services consistent with citizen needs and priorities, reacting to impacts and opportunities generated by the presence of mining.
- Responsibility: Municipalities manage their budget effectively in terms of cost and time, improving their practices to manage resources. 
- Accountability: Mayors implement social accountability actions which are driven by; their understanding of the benefits of transparency and the demand of the civil society .

This component will set the key working pieces and will set the basis for achieving the expected impact of this project. This component will seek to enlist mining companies operating in the region in a joint public  private effort under the concept of ""mining acting as a strategic ally of agriculture"". The idea is to help mining become associated with promoting improved productivity and diversification of key crops which will lead to improved food consumption and the raise of farmers income in the region. It will also seek to establish a network of trained agricultural technicians, who can be available for future engagements. 

Work will focus on nurturing the idea of Collective Action to support small farmers needs in a structured way, positioned and permanently nurtured. This will require a coordinated effort between small farmers, mining companies and government agencies (national, regional and local). 

Work will focus on: 
1.1 Put in practice and position a Collective Initiative
1.2 Establish a coordination Mechanism
1.3 Establish a network of Yachachiq

COMPONENT 2: IMPROVING LIVELIHOODS OF RURAL FAMILIES 
This component aims to improve the farm productivity, food availability and the families income in areas impacted by mining operations, so as to generate a better overall environment under which mining companies and agriculture families coexist. This will be done by incorporating culturally suitable farm production technologies, introducing high value and market oriented crops, livestock and poultry; developing peer-to-peer technical assistance activities by using the Yachachiq network, introducing best practices on nutritious food consumption and conducting some market advisory actions and links to potential buyers. Based on an improved productivity of farms, rural families are expected to improve food consumption and increase their income, which will reduce the pressure for mining related job opportunities. 

This components strategy will articulate a successful experience from the Ministry of Social Inclusion, through its program Haku Winay, and implement it under a collective initiative of the mining sector. The impact of this approach will be enhanced and communicated internally and more broadly to key stakeholders in the region. The coordinated participation of mining companies, local, regional and national government organizations will be articulated and coordinated under the Steering Committee.

Using Haku Wiay, a model tested by the government, has several advantages. First, the project has incorporated a gender strategy which recognizes the role of women in their families, with relation to the adoption of new practices in both, their farms and households for improving food consumption practices of their families. Second, the agricultural practices introduced by the program have been culturally adapted to the area and are environmentally friendly (i.e. no use of pesticides or introduction of foreign crops, promote organic production). Finally, in addition to having the endorsement of the government, mining companies feel positive about using a tested approach and having the central government as a key ally on this initiative. 

Work will focus on: 
2.1 Improve farmers productivity and diversification
2.2 Improve food consumption practices
2.3 Promote Market linkages","","","","","","The project's objective is to provide a working example of a community investment practice that can be adopted collectively by a group of mining companies in Apurimac, a region with high mining potential in Peru. It is expected that such practice, involving a public-private partnership, should help mining companies reduce social risk not only by improving relationships with their surrounding communities, but also by helping companies as a group to develop a positive working relationship with regional stakeholders, conveying a clear message that agriculture can co-exist and progress alongside with mining.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",600369,"","",Infrastructure and Natural Resources,"",2015-06-02T04:00:00Z,""

This project will guide the economic operator in implementing its business plan: setting up its organizational structure; developing its internal capacity, products, systems and procedures; adopting international best practices to operate as an effective leasing finance institution; and enabling it to conceptualize, implement and offer leasing in Haiti on a commercially sustainable basis.

By completion of this project, it is expected that:
-	The economic operator will be fully operational.
-	The value of leases granted by the economic operator will have reached US$ 15 million.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",601427,"","",Financial Institutions Group,"",2016-02-01T05:00:00Z,""

The objective of 2030 WRG is to accelerate water reforms and generate action to ensure water does not become a barrier to economic growth, while ensuring long-term environmental and social sustainability.

The program covers activities in line with the 2030 Water Resources Groups (2030 WRG) A-C-T approach of operation:

(1) Analysis - Developing hydro-economic analysis to highlight the macro water issues and catalyze water sector transformation and collective action; 

(2) Convening - Bringing together public & private sectors, community organizations, development agencies and international organizations in structured discussions for identifying solutions for water resources management through Multi-Stakeholder Platforms and identified workstreams for engagement; 

(3) Transformation - Implementing/ enacting policy, incentives, technical, financial, or governance-related water solutions through local stakeholders.

 The choice of priorities and initiatives to champion are determined by the Multi-Stakeholder Platform. 

 2030 WRG does not itself implement the identified solutions on the ground. However, it enables the formation of partnerships, identification of implementing entities, and unlocking of funding, in tandem with the members of its Multi-Stakeholder Platforms, so that implementation can be carried out effectively. 

 Current program for East Asia covers two engagements, Mongolia and Vietnam, with a third country under scoping.

 MONGOLIA: 

The Mongolia program focuses on the following workstreams:

1.            Water Demand Reduction & Water Supply Augmentation

2.            Water Valuation and Incentives for Sustainable Water Resources Management

3.            Capacity Building and Collaboration amongst Stakeholders

 VIETNAM: 

2030 WRG has conducted initial scoping missions and met with key government officials and other stakeholders, who endorsed the need for an analysis of Vietnam's water resources. 2030 WRG is conducting a water sector analysis to be guided by a multi-stakeholder advisory group to identify thematic priorities.","","","","","","This program aims to reduce the water demand-supply gap in select countries in East Asia, currently focusing on Mongolia and Vietnam, with a third country under scoping.

The success of this program will be assessed against:

(I) Instruments/Solutions: New instruments catalyzed through Multi-Stakeholder Partnerships (MSPs) and under implementation through third parties

(II) Partnerships: MSPs operational with established governance

(III) Knowledge Development: Development of robust & scientific info, incorporating hydro-economic cost-, benefit- and risk-based analysis, to guide the development of solutions

Instruments/ solutions towards closing the water gap identified by the MSPs under point (I) above will include:

(i) Demonstration projects to pilot innovative approaches;

(ii) Large-scale programs to unlock investments in infrastructure and technology;

(iii) Policy/ regulatory reforms covering incentives as well as institutional, governance and/ or tariff improvements;

(iv) Optimization of public and private funding through appropriate financing mechanisms.

 Impacts will vary by country according to the specific solutions prioritized by the MSPs, but will always fall within the following four physical impact categories:

(1) Reduced freshwater usage (cubic meters/ year);

(2) Gross agricultural value add per m3 fresh water used ($) (to be normalized for commodity price changes);

(3) Increased cost-effective water storage (cubic meters/ year);

(4) Reduced discharge of untreated wastewater/ polluted water (cubic meters/year). 

To measure the impact on improved water resource management policies and governance, a water governance score is included as an additional key impact indicator. 

Although national governments serve as the """"entry"""" client for 2030 WRG's engagement in any country, this program will convene private sector, in addition to government and civil society, as key actors for the development and implementation of solutions, and leverage the strengths of the private sector as a solution provider and innovator. 

NOTE: The mandate of 2030 WRG is to act as a catalyst, but for priority initiatives to be identified and implemented through the Multi-Stakeholder Partnerships. Hence the choice of which programs/instruments/solutions are developed is influenced by, but outside the direct control of, this program.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",601179,"","",Cross-Industry Advisory Services,"",2016-01-14T05:00:00Z,""

envisioned to provide support to Central and State Government departments in
undertaking reform on Doing Business indicators as well as on broader business
regulations not covered in the Doing Business agenda. During conception and
preimplementation, the project focused on all aspects of the full reform value
chain, including:&nbsp;-
Helping Government departments understand WHAT TO REFORM;-
Assisting Government departments to understand HOW TO REFORM;-
Supporting IMPLEMENTATION OF REFORM through the provision of advisory services;-
Providing support to MONITOR AND EVALUATE REFORMS; and-
Supporting the SUSTAINABILITY OF REFORM through the establishment of
institutional structures and other mechanisms.&nbsp;During pre-implementation, the
teams work led to a number of important results and lessons:-
The development of a DB Reform Memorandum in December 2014 provided the
Government with a clear understanding of what needed to be reformed to improve
on the DB indicators.-
The development of a detailed DB Reform Action Plan based on the Reform
Memorandum through consultation with Government andprivate
sector in July 2015 informed the Government on how to sequence and bring about
reforms.-
Inputs from these exercises allowed the Government to implement reforms in the
Starting a Business and Getting Electricity indicators in Doing Business 2016,
leading to India's first improvement in rank since the 10 indicators were
introduced.-
These inputs and further consultations also allowed the Government to develop
and circulate business reform action plans for all states to implement,
covering a wider range of areas outside of Doing Business.-
The circulation of the State Business Reform Action Plans, coupled with a
report prepared with the teams support that ranked states on business reform
implementation, has stimulated states to undertake a wide-ranging reform
program.-
Central and State Government departments have already employed consultants to
implement the reforms, thus removing the need fordirect
advisory support on all reforms. Instead, departments have reached out to the
team for knowledge on global best practices to help guide reforms, as well as
advice on specific reform areas, e.g. on construction permits.&nbsp;Since pre-implementation activities
have already led to a detailed understanding on what and how to reform, the
project implementationstrategy
has therefore been carefully readjusted to focus on only the following parts of
the reform value chain:-
Assisting Government departments to understand HOW TO REFORM;-
Providing support to MONITOR AND EVALUATE REFORMS;and-
Supporting the SUSTAINABILITY OF REFORM through the establishment of
institutional structures and other mechanisms.This
work will be carried out on two fronts: first, with a view to supporting
improvement on the DB indicators, and second in stimulating broader reform at
the state level.&nbsp;Component 1: Supporting
Reforms to Improve Doing Business IndicatorsThe December 2015 DB
Reform Memo and the July 2015 disaggregated DB Reform Action Plan provides
clear guidance to DIPP and to implementing departments on what to reform and
how to bring about the reforms. However, DIPP and implementing departments
require additional support in understanding global good practice in each of the
reform areas, as well as institutions to coordinate and decide on reforms that
span across multiple departments. The focus in this component is therefore to
provide knowledge on global best practices to help stimulate reform design,
support DIPP in monitoring reforms, and assist in developing institutional
structures to successfully implement reforms and sustain the reform momentum.
Additionally, specific reform ideas may emerge from these activities that can
further be added to the reformaction plan over time.
Specifically the team will focus on the following activities:1. Ensure effective
implementation through proposed Task Forces:



























































The pro Indicator","","","","","","The overall goal of the project is to catalyze business regulation reform in India by capacitating key change agents. This will be done by institutionalizing a reform agenda within key entities that govern business regulations, both on Doing Business indicators, as well as broader business regulation, and by achieving quick win regulatory reforms in key states to build a case for further state-level reform adoption.

Specifically, the project will achieve the following by project completion:
a) DIPP will institutionalize DB reform program through the creation of task force(s), reform monitoring team(s) and other mechanisms to stimulate reforms at the central and state government levels;
b) At least two states will develop reform action plans based on implementing best practices informed by the knowledge products prepared by the project

During the pilot stage IFC will implement the system at pilot farms in two oblasts and then will test a scaling-up model with 3,000 farmers in these oblasts. IFC will partner with the Joint Stock Holding Company Uzpahtasanoatexport in order to integrate the better cotton standard system into the national cotton production system.  Furthermore, IFC will build up the capacity at Uzpahtasanoatexport on maintaining the system in a sustainable manner.

During 2019-2022, IFC will focus on scaling up the sustainable cotton standard in the rest of the country and on achieving the full institutionalization of the system by Uzpahtasanoatexport. 
To roll out the project, IFC will also partner with the Ministry of Agriculture, the Association of Farmers, the Federation of Trade Unions, and the International Labor Organization, and IFCs investee client, Indorama Kokand Textile. 

The project will be implemented with financial support provided by the Hungarian EXIM Bank, IFCs long-term donor partner.","","","","","","Through this Advisory Project, IFC will facilitate transformations in the sector by introducing a sustainable cotton standard system to be embedded into the national cotton industry system, thus enabling farmers access to knowledge, financing and extending support on improving their farm management practices, cotton growing practices and on introducing decent work practices on their farms. 
Through the introduction of the sustainable cotton standard system IFC will help to increase the productivity and the environmental, social and financial sustainability of cotton production in Uzbekistan.  This, in turn, will allow the country to produce greater volumes of cotton on smaller acreage, and will contribute to a strategic goal of the diversification of crops in Uzbekistan.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",601530,"","","Manufacturing, Agribusiness & Services","",2017-02-07T05:00:00Z,2017-02-01T05:00:00Z

The program focuses on two major types of engagements: namely company level engagements and sector level engagements.
More specifically the Program will advise (i) IFC clients and other selected companies on the feasibility of new renewable energy projects in the local markets, and by supporting rehabilitation and efficiency improvements for existing generation and other energy infrastructure assets, but also (ii) work at sector level and strive to engage with groups of companies, energy associations, public institutions, equipment suppliers and other key private and public market/sector level stakeholders, to create new market opportunities and remove specific market barriers hindering the development of efficient and sustainable power and districting heating markets.
Under first type of engagements, advisory support for renewable generation and rehabilitation of existing power and district heating plants may include development/preparation/revision of: (i) RE project documentation, (ii) environmental studies, (iii) financing models, (iv) RE projects risk assessment, (v) analysis of regulatory frameworks and country resource potentials, mapping of local partners, etc. 
Under second type of engagements, the Program will focus on sector level activities that have the potential to promote cooperation and collective action by private sector players. In addition, it will remove barriers which would help to create a more competitive market, improve communication and cooperation with regulatory framework designers, increase awareness and adoption of good practices in project development, or advance the investment, scale and use of renewables/efficiency technologies in the power sector. 
The emphasis, however, will be on the sectors with the potential for multiple transactions in high potential, must-look countries where advisory service offers high value to private and public benefits.

IFC will act as PPP Transaction Advisor to EEP to support the implementation of grid connected solar PV installations on an IPP basis for a total installed capacity of 500MW over a number of sites in a series of procurement rounds. The projects are expected to be Ethiopia's first solar IPPs and will not only provide competitively priced clean power but also reduce Ethiopia's dependence on hydro resources by diversifying the energy supply mix.

C3P will assist EEP as transaction advisor with activities split into two phases:

1) Project Preparation

a. Site selection support

EEP has prepared a shortlist of potential sites for the project. IFC would help EEP to finalise the selection of the specific locations for the two projects, based on information provided by EEP and reflecting a combination of technical, logistical and environmental and social considerations, based on IFC Performance Standards.


b. Technical and E&S due diligence

Once EEP has selected the project sites, the project team would conduct an E&S scoping study as well as all relevant site specific technical studies (solar resource assessment, grid connection conditions, etc.).

c. Legal and regulatory due diligence

The project team would perform a legal and regulatory due diligence exercise covering all legal, regulatory and policy matters impacting on the project.

2) Bid Preparation

a.	Localization of the template Scaling Solar documents

Based on the outcome of the legal and technical due diligence, and consultations with the client, the project team would adapt the Scaling Solar documents to suit the context of the country and that of the project.

b.	Consultation with IFC Investment

A fundamental part of the Scaling Solar model is the offer by other parts of the WBG (IFC Investment, MIGA and IDA) of financing and credit enhancement instruments on a stapled basis. For these instruments to be offered to all bidders, these other parts of the WBG require a final review of the 'localized' Scaling Solar documents. The project team and the client would therefore share these with colleagues across the WBG for their review and response (following the guidance of our COI colleagues at all times).

A two-step tender process will be launched, with an initial Request for Qualification and a subsequent Request for Proposals, both following the Scaling Solar templates.

More than 65 percent of Myanmar's population has no access to grid-based energy services.  In rural areas, more than two thirds of households rely on candles, kerosene, batteries and diesel generators to meet their energy needs.  To address this, the Government of Myanmar, with the assistance of the World Bank Group and other donors, has adopted the National Electrification Plan (NEP), which aims to achieve universal access to sustainable electricity services by 2030 through a combination of grid extension and off-grid programs. 

The potential for commercial approaches to help meet this goal is strong, particularly in off-grid, and the NEP recognizes the need for private investment.  However, there are market challenges that have prevented deeper private involvement in Myanmar's off-grid sector, including: (1) insufficient market knowledge among private sector players; (2) lack of information for consumers on the quality of solar products; and (3) limited availability of financing for end consumers and companies.  Lighting Myanmar will support international and Myanmar-based companies to overcome these challenges and create a sustainable market for high-quality off-grid energy solutions, including solar lanterns, solar home systems, and potentially mini-grids. 

Drawing from experience in other Lighting Global programs, Lighting Myanmar will work with lighting product manufacturers, distributors, financial institutions, development partners, and the government in six areas: 
1. Quality assurance. The Lighting Global product quality standards were developed under Lighting Africa and have now been adopted as the international standards for off-grid solar lighting products. Lighting Myanmar will support the introduction of products meeting these standards in Myanmar and will work with government agencies and others to promote adoption of these standards where appropriate. 
2. Market intelligence. The project will conduct in-depth research on the off-grid market to inform the market strategies of Lighting Global Associates and their local partners. 
3. Business development support. This includes a number of activities to help Lighting Global Associates build productive partnerships in the market, including identifying potential local partners (e.g. distributors, retailers, financial institutions) and advising on strategies for entering the market. 
4. Consumer awareness. One of the core pillars of the project is implementation of widespread consumer awareness campaigns to stimulate demand for quality-verified off-grid lighting products. These will include multiple delivery channels, drawing on the experience from other Lighting programs. 
5. Regulatory and policy dialogue. To encourage policies that are supportive of private involvement in the market, Lighting Myanmar will engage in a dialogue with a range of government actors, as well as international development partners, on issues including subsidies, tariffs, and quality standards.  
6. Access to Finance. Lighting Myanmar will seek to address financing barriers, both for companies and end consumers, by working with local and international financial institutions to increase their involvement and develop solutions for the sector.","","","","","","The goal of Lighting Myanmar is to support the creation of a sustainable commercial market for high-quality off-grid energy solutions in Myanmar.  In doing so, it will help achieve two main impacts: 
1. Supplying reliable energy services to customers in off-grid rural areas and underserved urban areas through high quality solar products, including lanterns, solar home systems, and potentially mini-grids. 
2. Mitigating climate change by displacing fossil fuel-based sources of electricity generation, in particular kerosene and diesel. 

Intermediate outcomes will include increasing the public's awareness and understanding of quality standards for solar products; improving the policy and regulatory environment for the off-grid sector; and easing constraints on access to finance for off-grid companies and customers.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",600863,"","",Cross-Industry Advisory Services,"",2016-05-24T04:00:00Z,2016-06-01T04:00:00Z

As IFC is a key investor in four on-going hydropower projects, there is real opportunity through this advisory work to lead by example in providing important advice and guidance. It will do so by adopting an inclusive, multi-stakeholder approach to build capacity among local government, civil society, and the private sector to enable the adoption of good international industry practices of E&S standards. The program will also aim to address the overall governance of the entire Jhelum-Poonch watershed including laying foundations for institutional arrangements for integrated river basin management and commission important scientific studies to address data gaps including surveying of tributaries with significant data gaps and conducting environmental flows assessments in the watershed. 

The program focuses on two interlinked components over the two year period:
Component 1: Improve and enable application of good practice E&S standards to manage cumulative impacts of the cascade of hydropower projects in the Jhelum-Poonch watershed for sustainable hydropower development and strategic watershed management:

Ultimately this effort expects to help local authorities, together with project sponsors, academia, and environmental NGOs, achieve sustainable hydropower development and integrated watershed management of the Jhelum-Poonch Basin. The overall approach agreed includes: 

-Creation of offsets in the form of new protected areas in the watershed to secure appropriate conditions for the long term survival of key species . 
-Coordination of environmental flow management, focusing on adequate releases from dams, when feasible avoid peaking operation, and coordinated flushing of sediments.
-Preparation of guidelines and procedures for impact assessment, monitoring and adaptive management for all HPP in this watershed. 
-Development and strengthening capacity of key institutions, as the strategy will not succeed without strong institutions that have the legal mandate for protection of environment and biodiversity, and 
-Design of financial mechanisms to assure long term sustainability.

Component 2: Establish multi-stakeholder platforms (MSPs) to enable capacity in practical E&S risk management and adoption of IFCs Performance Standards.
This component will focus on the development of training materials and implementation of training events to provide technical support and capacity development to local government officials, civil society and the private sector (hydropower developers, consultants and EPC contractors) operating in the Jhelum and Indus watersheds.  This component provides the necessary foundations for the overall governance work to be implemented under Component 1. Specific areas of support include: (i) good international industry practices (GIIP) on hydropower and understanding of the IFC Performance Standards, (ii) cascade and sediment management, (iii) downstream flow regimes, (iv) biodiversity conservation and strategy implementation, (v) stakeholder engagement, (vi) labor and security issues, particularly in the context of local communities and livelihoods, and (vii) fish ladder, passes, hatcheries and re-stocking practices.

IFC will also support the formation of a Hydropower Developers Working Group and promote additionality to potential or existing IFC investment clients to enable the private sector adopt good international industry practices in E&S standards for the hydropower sector. This will improve the capacity of existing hydropower developers and provide expertise related to good international industry practices. The HDWG will provide a space for the private sector to influence policy by regularly engaging with the government through periodic joint meetings where IFC and the broader WBG is engaging on power sector reforms.","","","","","","The overall goal of the program is to increase the share of new private sector investments in the hydropower sector in the Jhelum Poonch Watershed in Pakistan  that adhere to good international industry practice environmental and social standards by 2021, as well as provide replicable and sustainably sound environmental and social outcomes.

4.	The project will also facilitate growth and sustainability of dairy sector in Issyk-Kul region through creation and implementation of the well-organized Public Private Dialogue (PPD). PPD is given high priority and significant attention for two reasons: (i) it is the key to ensure buy-in on the reform program by the public and private sectors as well as to identify follow up reform priorities, and (ii) it establishes a platform for the ongoing sustainability of the program after the specific World Bank Group assistance ends. While the Project will focus on a regional dairy PPD platform, this platform can be utilized across sectors to promote wider development of the Issyk-Kul region.
PPD will also help ensure reforms are properly implemented by providing a regular platform to identify, monitor, and respond to issues of poor implementation
With support from ongoing T&C advisory in Kyrgyzstan, local authorities have already created a PPD secretariat, so the Project will facilitate its further development and implementation including capacity building of all.","","","","","","The project aims to contribute to the improved domestic food safety and new investments in Issyk Kull region and lay the foundation for sustainable exports of goods of animal origin from Kyrgyzstan. This goal will be achieved through the following: 
1. The project will help to: a) make national animal identification and traceability system (AITS) operational for cattle, and b) establish regulatory framework for risk based inspections in dairy sector.
2. The project will help to introduce a systemic, organized and effective work with potential and existing investors in at least 2 municipalities of Issyk Kul region by the end of project implementation, resulting in 10 documented interests from potential and existing investors by Project completion.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",601612,"","",Trade and Competitiveness,"",2017-01-18T05:00:00Z,2017-02-01T05:00:00Z

To address the refugee crisis, IFC proposes to support The Lebanese Association for Development (Al-Majmoua), the leading and largest microfinance institution who has been trying to implement activities that benefit Syrian refugees and hosting communities in Lebanon by helping these institutions to develop new products that cater to the needs of these unique segments of the population. 
Under this project, IFC proposes to support Al-Majmoua through the development of two products: 
-Very Small Enterprise (VSE) Product Development: IFC will support Al-Majmoua in scaling up their lending to Very Small Enterprises (VSEs) with a particular focus on host communities, which will in turn directly or indirectly increase employment opportunities for the hosting communities including the Syrian refugees. 
-Very small equity Product Development: IFC will also support Al-Majmoua in developing a very small equity product that can be targeted at both Syrian refugees and host communities. This idea emerged as a result of the fact that Al-Majmoua (under a project with UNHCR which is coming to an end), has already been working with women from the hosting communities and Syrian refugees to do embroidery work and has given the women the required machinery to do so as a grant. In order to make this a more sustainable and scalable initiative, IFC will work with Al-Majmoua to design and pilot a very small equity product whereby they provide an asset, share revenues with the asset holder and allow the asset holder to gradually buy the assets.","","","","","","The project will support Al Majmoua to develop, design and pilot two new financing products, one of them being the very small enterprise (VSE) lending product, to cater to the needs of Syrian refugees and hosting communities in Lebanon .","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",601826,"","",Financial Institutions Group,"",2017-01-12T05:00:00Z,2017-01-01T05:00:00Z

3.   Notice and Comment systems
4.   Business-to-Government feedback mechanisms on reform implementation
5.   Systemic Investor Response Mechanisms

These components are described below:

Component 1.  Regulatory Policy and Delivery (RPD) Review.  This is a diagnostic/analytical tool that provides a comprehensive overview and assessment of government-wide policies, institutions, procedures and tools used to prepare, assess, consult, implement and monitor regulation. The RPD Reviews are intended to help improve the understanding of the operation, quality and effectiveness of regulatory systems. The Reviews will identify and recommend options for prioritized improvements of countries' regulatory management systems. 

Component 2.  Evidence-based policy-making: Based on knowledge products developed under project 601180 this activity will provide guidance and options for improving the design and implementation for systems for evidence-based regulatory policy-making.  In this capacity the program will provide guidance to two pilots. This support will not be comprehensive in terms of covering a full RIA design and implementation program, but rather it will complementary to ongoing reform efforts.

Component 3.  Notice and Comment Systems:  Such mechanisms will help increase regulatory predictability and enhance the quality of regulatory design by leveraging the knowledge of the citizen and private sector in the formulation of regulations.   A focused approach to introducing Notice and Comment systems in developing countries will be developed covering integration of technical, regulatory and institutional, user mobilization and M&E dimensions, and piloted in 4-5 countries.  

Component 4: Business-to-Government Feedback Mechanisms on Reform Implementation:  These will generate just-in-time information on the quality of reform implementation and will be customized to specific regulatory reforms. The findings can trigger corrective actions by government to close implementation gaps, with the effectiveness of such actions verified through follow-on surveys.  

Component 5;  Systemic Investor Response Mechanism (SIRM):   The SIRM has two main elements:1) implementation of a protocol designed to enable the administration to coordinate its agencies to timely react and catch and resolve investors' grievances well before they escalate to legal disputes and 2) implementation of an ICT tool to track the investment at risk of being lost due to government conduct that is afterwards retained. 

Component 6;  Closing the Implementation Gap and Uncertainty of G2B Services (CGU):  In some countries a lack of trust between the private and public sectors may hinder the collection of information on excessive discretionary behavior through feedback loops or surveys.  The CGU approach can address this issue by developing an evidence base of objective data at the point of service delivery (i.e. the contact point between firms and the public agency) and support governments in developing performance measures based on the findings.  The CGU work will measure the actual experience during those interactions based on objectively verifiable statistics (e.g. originating from tracking actual case files) compared to relevant regulations.","","","","","","The purpose of this project, which is part of the WBGs Good Regulatory Practices (GRP) program, is to help governments enhance the quality of regulatory regimes and their outcomes and put in place effective, transparent, accountable and consultative reform processes that assist in reform prioritization, design, and implementation.  

The expected outcomes are as follows:

a) Effective Notice and Comment systems and evidence-based policy-making in several countries, leading to good quality regulations and increased regulatory predictability.

b) Business-to-Government feedback loops in several countries in order to monitor implementation quality, thus helping to improve quality of regulatory reform implementation in these countries.

c) Systematic Investment Response Mechanism in several countries, leading to corrective actions by governments to address investor grievances, thereby helping to increase investment retention and further expansion.

d) More uniform application of regulations and enhanced predictability of service delivery.

These outcomes are expected to lead to increased regulatory quality which, in turn, leads to increased investment, job creation and productivity gains.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",601780,"","",Trade and Competitiveness,"",2016-12-21T05:00:00Z,2017-01-01T05:00:00Z

In addition, there is low female business ownership and women are less visible in leadership, occupying lower-ranking positions than men. Myanmar's democratic transition presents a solid opportunity for the private sector to capitalize on the tangible benefits of a more equitable workforce.

The goal of Get2Equal is to close employment gaps between men and women in Myanmar by demonstrating the business case for the private sector to invest in gender equality. The case for gender equality is compelling.  Gender equality is good for business and is also associated with improved national economic growth, increased organizational performance, better ability to attract and retain talent and enhanced firm reputation.

Get2Equal is part of a regional program which focuses on engaging lead firms in strategic and high growth sectors to achieve gender equality. The project seeks to support companies in Myanmar with tools, experience and capacity to develop business solutions to close the gender gap. It will concentrate on improving the capacity of business to attract female talent into sectors and jobs not traditionally held by women; retain female talent in the jobs including once they have children; and develop female talent into management positions. 

The project will deliver impact by: 1) developing industry- and country-specific research to capture evidence on gender gaps and solutions; 2) working directly with clients that have strategic relevance in key sectors; and 3) creating opportunities for companies to benefit from peer learning.","","","","","","The goal of Get2Equal is to close employment gaps between men and women in Myanmar by demonstrating the business case for the private sector to invest in gender equality.

1.	Developing Commodity Collateralized Financing (CCF) for Agricultural commodities not mandated to be traded at the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX)
2.	Developing Commodity Collateralized Financing (CCF) for industrial goods (raw material or processed goods) in warehouses in or linked to companies in industrial parks 

Component 1 - Developing CCF for agricultural commodities not mandated to be traded at the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX) 

Agriculture accounts for more than three quarters of employment, forty percent of output, and a third of total exports in Ethiopia (90 percent of goods exports). Currently, Agricultural financing is largely limited to a few commercial farms in export oriented sectors. However, the prospect for CCF for agricultural commodities is enormous given the fact that a number of smallholder farmers are already organized under marketing cooperatives and unions trading in bulk of commodities. According to the Federal Cooperatives Agency, there are 41,985 primary cooperatives nationally with a total coverage of 7.03 million smallholder farmers. These cooperatives are organized under 278 unions.

A product like CCF would enable unions to strengthen their negotiation power in the market by allowing them to defer sales until they are offered reasonable prices. It can enable them to pay their members without having to wait for the actual sales of the products. The fact of securing financing against food crop inventories also contributes to food security by a) increasing local food processing capacity; b) reducing post-harvest losses through better storage; c) contributing to improving quality of the stored goods under better conditions; and d) potentially improving prices for farmers. At the producer level, warehouses for Apex Cooperative organizations could be used to promote better storage and more orderly marketing of crops for the benefit of small holder farmers.  At the processing level, collateral management and stock monitoring services would enable processors to secure needed inventories through-out the crop year and provide them with liquidity so they could offer better prices to farmers.  

The project will partner with the Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA) to promote the use of CCF for agricultural commodities under this component. 

Component 2 - Developing CCF for industrial goods (raw material or processed goods) in warehouses in or linked to companies in industrial parks

The favorable prospects for CCF are further stressed by the governments recent emphasis on the importance of developing Industrial Parks (IPs) mainly aimed at attracting foreign investors. Eight industrial parks have been established so far (4 privately developed and 4 government owned); two of which are focused on textiles/garments. In addition to these industrial parks, there are plans to establish integrated agro-industrial parks focusing on processing of agricultural commodities. The first of such parks is due to open in 12 to 18 months. In such parks opportunities will arise to finance inventories.  For example, agro-processors (producing wheat flour, animal feed, edible oils, beer, etc.) usually need to hold crop inventories for processing, which could be used for collateral for financing by banks. Similarly companies in industrial parks could use raw or processed goods as collateral for funding. For the textile/garment industrial park in Hawassa, while the companies in the park are well established international firms (from China, Sri Lanka, India, Indonesia, Hong Kong, etc.) and may not need local financing, their local Ethiopian suppliers are likely to be facing access to finance constraints and inventory financing could provide a solution.

Other counterparts include the Port of Nouakchott, the CIMAM (Mauritania?s International Arbitration and Mediation Center), JCCM (Jeune Chambre de Commerce de Mauritanie, a business association), Chambre de Commerce et d?Industrie, Universit? de Nouakchott, local and international investors, and other major players of the innovation field.

Pillar 1: Improving business environment to spur competitiveness

Under this Pillar, the project will address selected core constraints to the business environment. It is targeting the foundations of the investment climate in (a) reforming the property rights regime, a leading constraint for private investment in the country, and (b) strengthening the dysfunctional commercial justice system, improving in particular the quality of judicial processes, as measured by DB.

Component 1.a: Consolidation and modernization of the property rights regime
Component 1.b: Strengthening commercial justice
Component 1.c: Simplifying procedures to cross-border trade

Pillar 2: Foster entrepreneurship and inclusion

The development in the short, medium and longer term of a more dynamic and entrepreneurial private sector characterized by the creation of startups on a continual basis and improvement of productivity levels of existing ones would help to provide alternative sources of employment and support economic diversification. The objective of this pillar is therefore to facilitate the growth of MSMES and entrepreneurship in the country, with a special focus on youth and women.

In Benin, only 1.6 million people (28 percent of the rural and semi-urban population) currently have access to water through piped water systems (PWSs). In 2006, the government of Benin launched reforms in the rural water sector that transferred the management of 46 percent of the existing PWSs from local communities to private operators under public-private partnership (PPP) contracts to improve operational accountability and quality of service.

The project aims to create new markets for private investment in the agribusiness sector of Ghana.  The project builds directly on the findings of the recent Country Private Sector Diagnostic (CPSD), conducted by the World Bank Group, which identifies agribusiness as one of the most promising economic sectors in Ghana.  Based on an assessment of the market barriers, pre-implementation findings, and comparative advantages of IFC, the project will focus on the following three components: (i) investment promotion to identify and proactively support the entry of responsible agribusiness investors, (ii) addressing key regulatory reforms, and (iii) promotion of agri-service market opportunities.

Component 1: Investment Promotion - Supporting entry of new, responsible agribusiness investors
The project will begin by supporting the Government of Ghana to ensure that the pre-conditions are in place for new investors.

Activities
1.1 Pre-screen potential projects with knowledgeable internal specialists and agribusiness professionals, to ensure the necessary physical, regulatory and financial conditions are in place to attract investors 
1.2 Support the Government in the development and targeted dissemination of investor-oriented business models and information packs that will provide the core country, value chain and/or project specific information needed to generate investor interest 
1.3 Develop a portfolio of investment opportunities for agricultural products / value chains, selected on the basis of an extensive assessment of market opportunities (national, regional and global levels) and value chain competitive potential
1.4 Support the development of a pipeline of potential investors known by IFC to have interests in high value agricultural production / services, in collaboration with the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) and the Ghana Investment Promotion Center (GIPC)
1.5 Provide technical support to MoFA and GIPC for the company-specific follow up support that will be required by investors that are interested in pursuing the opportunities 
1.6 Convene investor roundtables (jointly with Government and WB) to market the opportunities to investors that have expressed interest based on initial outreach and roadshows by the government

Component 2: Sector regulatory reform 
Key challenges in the regulatory system related to private investment in agribusiness include, for example, importation and distribution of basic inputs, as well as Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary (SPS) issues related to previous restrictions on certain exports from Ghana.  The project will support public-private dialogue on these and other regulatory issues, in order to drive reforms. 

Activities:
2.1 Strengthen existing public-private dialogue mechanisms in collaboration with the World Bank in order to identify and promote opportunities for reforms that will help crowd in private financing.
2.2 Undertake a detailed assessment of the SPS system to identify the state of the system, gaps and specific advisory needs (further detailed activities to follow this assessment).    

Component 3  Promotion of agri-service market opportunities
Linked to the first two components, it was highlighted in the CPSD that Ghana has a range of untapped opportunities to attract private sector participation in agricultural services, including the provision of storage, transportation, cold chain and quality-control solutions.  

Activities
3.1 Assess local service market needs: conduct a mapping of market players in the agri-services sector
3.2 Explore opportunities to mobilize entry of new service providers, including via targeted investor events","","","","","","The objective of the Invest Ghana: Agribusiness Competitiveness Advisory Project (Invest Ghana) is to create new markets for private investment in the agribusiness sector in Ghana.

The project will target new private investment in the agribusiness sector.  Outcomes tracked will include the number of commitments by private companies to invest, and the number of regulatory reforms enacted. 

Recognizing that combined public and private sector engagement is critical to alleviate the key market failures, the project will link IFC and World Bank efforts to unlock commercial agribusiness opportunities in Ghana. The project also represents an effort to operationalize the findings of the recent Country Private Sector Diagnostic, conducted by the World Bank Group, which identifies agribusiness as one of the most promising sectors for IFC in Ghana.
