The activities would include a mix of above the line (ATL) activities such as mass media campaigns, thematic campaigns in partnership with media agencies, radio campaigns and below the line (BTL) activities such as events, conferences, collector campaigns, awards, kiosks in residential colonies, etc. 2. Integration of the informal sector in the formal sector supply chain: This involves engagement with the informal sector collectors and/or dismantlers to secure their buy-in and participation in the program. This would be followed by capacity building and training of those players who agree to be part of the program. The training will be provided on various topics like awareness and implications of the new E-Waste Rules, good practice for collection and dismantling, how to successfully run a small business (taxes, budgeting, serving your customers etc.), online MIS / tracking system for E-Waste. 3. Setting up collection centers and development of tracking & monitoring system for E-Waste flows in the formal sector. To integrate the informal sector into the supply chain, collection centers will be setup in the four cities. Each collection centre will be managed by a franchisee. To support the network of franchisees and last mile collectors, an information system will be developed for online tracking and quality assurance. 4. Development of a toolkit for dissemination - a toolkit will be developed to capture lessons learned from this project for wider dissemination and replication by other industry players. The toolkit may include guidelines for developing a sustainable supply chain in the E-Waste sector, trends and emerging business models, operation manuals for integrating the informal sector in the formal sector supply chain.",,,,,,"The project will focus on supporting the formation and establishment of a Producer Responsibility Organization (PRO) in India which will serve as a long-term and cost effective solution to the industrys challenge of collecting e-waste in an economical and responsible manner.

COMPONENT 1 - CLIENT ADVISORY
The client will be assisted to develop a robust Health and Safety (HSE) mechanism for its operation, particularly for the UFS. This will also lead to the development of training modules and guidelines for the new LPG users. With increased comfort of knowing how to use gas for cooking it is expected that adoption will increase. This will lead to reduced GHG emissions, deforestation and indoor pollution.

(iii) Promote regional knowledge dissemination through the organization of peer-to-peer learning events.",,,,,,"The objective of the Indicator Based Reform Advisory project for Latin America and the Caribbean is to help client governments in the region in the implementation of reforms in areas measured by investment climate indicators. These reforms are expected to improve the regulatory environment for firms to encourage entrepreneurship, investment, and formal job creation. 

More specifically, the IBRA LAC project aims to provide rapid-response advisory services in Latin America and the Caribbean through a flexible delivery mechanism in areas including procedural improvement and implementation of best practices. The project also aims to build reform momentum and support through regional peer-to-peer learning activities that bring together practitioners and encourage knowledge dissemination. 
	
Literature suggests that the type of reforms implemented under this project have a positive impact in terms of economic growth and employment. For example, Ramalho et al. (2006) find that improving from the lowest to the highest quartile in the Doing Business rankings is associated with a 2.3 percentage point increase in annual growth, and with a 10-11 percent increase in the creation of new firms according to Fisman et al (2004). Studies led in Mexico (Bruhn 2008), Colombia (C√É¬°rdenas and Rozo 2007) and India (Aghion et al 2008) show that a reduction in the regulatory barriers to entry is associated with a 5 to 6 percent increase in the creation of new firms (Motta et al, An Open Door for Firms, Viewpoint, June 2010). Bruhn (2008) also finds that implementing one-stop shops for business registration was associated with a 2.8 percent increase in employment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,599907,,,Investment Climate,,2013-12-18T05:00:00Z,

Currently, these countries are all suffering from a supply gap with, on the one hand, inflated
 
 energy demand due to high efficiency losses in transmission and distribution systems and, on the other hand, a constrained energy supply due to limited investment in new and existing energy generation assets. 
 
This project seeks to address these challenges
 
 by attracting private investments to grid strengthening, efficiency and loss reduction projects in existing power and heat systems, as well as to clean energy generation projects. The program will achieve this through (i) direct support to the private sector,
 
 and (ii) engaging with the governments to improve the investment climate. This holistic approach allows the project to pragmatically assess where investments in efficiency or generation are more viable. The initial focus will primarily be on Kazakhstan,
 Kyrgyz 
 Republic, and Azerbaijan, while allowing for engagements in Uzbekistan, Armenia and Georgia if and when opportunities arise. 
 
The project will advise governments on energy sector legislative reforms (including secondary legislation, standard
 power purchase 
 agreements, and regulations and permitting) in order to reduce key barriers to private investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency. In parallel, the project will work directly with both international investors (who may lack the detailed
 understanding

It represents the best practice learnings of the Lighting Africa pilot. Building on the success of the Lighting AFrica pilot, IFC is replicating
 
 the Kenya pilot across AFrica (in partnership with the World Bank) and into Asia and MENA. 
 
As IFC expands its work in this area, the activities which are common across all country programs are coordinated and managed through Lighting Global. These
 include 
 the product quality assurance function, the support for a self-sustaining industry association (GOGLA), collaborative relationships with global industry, multi-lateral, and NGO partners, and efforts to establish with the industry end-of-product
 life recylcing 
 and disposal systems to address the new waste stream created by proliferation of solar devices. 
 
Central to Lighting Global will be a strategy of building the institutions in the market which can take on the roles that IFC has played
 in catalyzing this 
 nascent global market. Thus, Lighting Global will manage a process for spinning off ownership of the Lighting Global product quality standards, and the testing and certification of products, to a consortium or institution with the technical
 capacity, global 
 footprint, and insitutional mandate to administer quality assurance for the growing industry in a sustainable way. 
 
Lighting Global will also provide the institutional support with knowledge tools and quality assurance to ensure the
 appropriate design

As the foundation for these country programs, Lighting Global supports the following development impacts:
-- access to modern lighting services;
-- health benefits related to reduced indoor air pollution exposure from open flame kerosene wick lamps, as well as reduced injuries and deaths from fire associated with open wick kerosene lantern use;
-- increased productivity for school children and from working adults able to be productive at night;
-- economic savings from reduced kerosene purchases and cell phone charging services resulting in the ability to step further up the energy ladder by acquiring more advanced solar kits with extended energy services (fans, multiple lights, multiple phone charging, radio, TV)

As the off-grid lighting market matures, Lighting Global supports the transition of the industry to full self-sufficiency by supporting the industry association (GOGLA) to take on industry support roles currently played by IFC, and by transitioning the market to a self-sustaining product quality assurance function which does not rely on IFC into the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,600173,,,Sustainable Business Advisory,,2013-12-05T05:00:00Z,

 the size of facilities are subject to confirmation by IFC technical consultants and investors. The government will provide investor(s) with land for development rent-free to enhance project economics.",,,,,,"Cold storage helps maintain the quality and extend the shelf-life of perishable foodstuffs if consumption does not follow immediately upon harvest. A lack of cold storage may results in post-harvest losses of an estimated 20%-40% of production, in spoilage by the time produce reaches urban consumers, and exclusion from key export markets such as Russia where grocery stores are raising standards for quality of supply. Moreover, absent cold storage, farmers must sell their produce immediately upon harvest which results in gluts, depressed prices and seasonality; perishable foodstuffs is not available at certain times of year unless they are imported or grown in greenhouses. All this has far-reaching consequences in a country where agriculture accounts for 23% of GDP and 48% (2012) of employment. Direct positive impacts of improvements in the supply chain include increased exports, higher incomes for farmers, reduced seasonality of supply and pricing for consumers, and creation of new semi-skilled jobs.  Indirect positive impacts will relate to overall improving of business environment, introduction of advanced agricultural technologies and techniques, and improved food safety. 

There is considerable scope to strengthen the agricultural value chains by removing constraints and demand and supply. On the supply side, low farm productivity limits the marketed surplus, and farmer capacity to market this surplus is constrained by inexperience with market activity and low economies of scale. IBRD reports that only one-third of farmers sell any of their output and of those who do only 15% (5% of all farmers) sell in the national market or export internationally. On the demand side low access to credit, weak market links, and barriers to entry and expansion all constrain demand of processors for agricultural commodities. Processors struggle to secure a reliable supply of raw material, lack investment capital and knowledge of food safety standards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,600076,,,Public-Private Partnerships Transaction Advisory,,2014-05-20T04:00:00Z,

527,Niger Irrigation,Advisory Services,,Completed,Africa,Niger,,,2014-07-18T04:00:00Z,,,,"Niger is one of three African countries selected to participate in the World Bank managed Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR). Under the PPCR, US$50 million in grant finance and US$60 million in concessional loan finance is available to fund the

 
 interventions detailed in Niger's Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR). The IFC and the private sector arm of the African Development Bank are responsible for the private sector interventions within Niger's SPCR.

Niger is a dry country that
 is
 
 predicted to get drier with climate change. Increased access to improved irrigation will make Niger's agricultural sector more resilient to climate change and enhance food security for the country. Hence it is critically important that the agricultural
 sector
 
 in Niger adopts improved irrigation techniques. Improved irrigation technologies will improve productivity and lead to the efficient use of the country's scarce water resources. It will also enable farmers in Niger to protect their crops and livelihoods
 despite
 
 longer dry seasons and unexpected weather events (such as heat waves).

In 2012, the IFC conducted an in-depth market study with PPCR grant finance to investigate opportunities for private sector investment in improved irrigation systems. The
 proposed Niger
 
 Irrigation Project will test and implement the recommendations from the IFC study in a two-phased approach. 

Phase I comprises an Advisory Services (AS) program to test the financial viability of commercializing improved irrigation systems
 by the private
 
 sector to farmers in Niger. The program will facilitate access and adoption of these systems by farmers in Niger and aims to increase agricultural productivity of farmers and strengthen farmers resilience to climate change. 

Pending
 the success of Phase
 
 I, a second phase will comprise investments and associated AS programs to scale up private sector investments in improved irrigation systems in Niger. The results of Phase I will inform the investment structures that will be used
 in Phase II. The rationale
 
 for the two-phased approach is that market conditions do not currently exist to provide irrigation equipment on a fully commercial basis.
 
The specific components of the program are: 

1. Competitive selection of a lead
 agricultural input firm to provide
 
 irrigation equipment to small and medium sized farmers in Niger, and provision of support to the firm in the expansion of its irrigation business in the country to reach farmers.

2. Providing of training to farmers
 on financial management as well as on
 
 the installation and use of improved irrigation systems and associated inputs (e.g. greenhouses, hybrid seeds, fertilizers and pesticides).

3. Facilitate increased access to markets for farmers participating in
 the program.",,,,,,"The goal of the Niger Irrigation Project is to promote private sector investments in irrigation in Niger.  A private firm (the client) interested to conduct business in the irrigation sector in Niger will be selected through a competitive bidding process.  IFC funds under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience will then be used to finance the training of farmers and to partially cover the costs of irrigation equipment used in the program during the pilot period.  The farmers will be trained by the client to use the improved irrigation equipment and to manage their finances with regards to the purchase of the irrigation equipment.  The IFC will work with the client to design appropriate training methods as well as structures for private sector financing of irrigation equipment.  If successful, the project is expected to subsequently facilitate access to irrigation equipment for farmers in Niger through private sector financing.

The client will provide initial training on relevant technology, agronomy and finance to a group of select farmers. Farmers will be selected for training and may receive finance based on their skills and commitment to the program. These farmers will serve as demonstration of the technical and financial feasibility of the proposed interventions. 

The project will track results via the number of farmers that receive training, and the number of farmers that purchase, install and operate irrigation equipment as a result of the project.  The project will also track the number of hectares under imporved irrigation, and the agronomy results for the farmers, including increases in producitvity and reduction in water use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,600247,,,Sustainable Business Advisory,,2014-03-03T05:00:00Z,

The situation is even more acute in rural areas with only 16% grid access rates. In addition, 40% of the population is 'under-electrified' i.e. having less than
 
 12 hours of grid power per day.

The WBG through the Lighting Africa Program in Nigeria aims to increase access to better, cleaner and safer off-grid lighting to the rural populations not connected to the grid. The program will accelerate the development
 
 of the markets for modern off-grid lighting products. 

The program will accomplish this by undertaking a number of market development activities:
-Market Intelligence: to help product marketers and distributors understand the new off-grid lighting market
 
 segment, supply and distribution chains. The insights from the research serve to inform their business and strategic plans.
-Quality Assurance: promoting the adoption of Lighting Global quality standards across the sector to counter the risk of market
 spoilage 
 from the infiltration of low quality products that erodes confidence in the new off-grid technologies among consumers, financiers and stakeholders.
-Access to finance: Adequate financing along the entire supply chain has been identified as being
 critical 
 for the growth of the off-grid lighting market. The program will develop financing facilities through financial institutions to meet the demand from the market.
-Consumer Education: creating awareness, for a market to grow and thrive, consumers
 must know 
 what products are available and understand the value and benefits of these products over what the consumers are currently using (kerosene and candles). Consumers must also be able to distinguish between good and poor quality products in order
 to get good value

 competition and creating

It will however, provide results that will allow the client, RAMSA to possibly successfully expand its reforestation efforts in the Peruvian Amazon as part of a 30 MW energy project with KALLPA that would dramatically reduce Iquitos' reliance on fossil fuels for its energy needs. The CO2 footprint for Iquitos is relatively high since diesel is currently shipped by road from Lima over the Andes to Pucallpa, and subsequently down the Ucayalli river to Iquitos where it is burned in generators to produce electricity.  The substitution of foreign oil transported over long distances with wood fiber grown locally on degraded lands would logically result in a  reduction in GHG emissions.

Application of the recommendations provided by IFC as part of the study, would ultimately increase the likelihood of a successful, environmentally sound, forest based energy project that would affect many communities and several private companies in Loreto, Peru's largest department: first, by establishing the business case for reforesting degraded lands, second, by reducing emissions leading to climate change, and third, by protecting standing forests with carbon stocks from conversion to non-forest uses. 

IFC's analytical work will be useful to 2 companies with a high potential for wide-scale impact. At present, it is unclear exactly how many hectares would be planted nor how much area would be subjected to Reduced Impact Logging to yield a (currently unknown) volume of legally sourced logs.

It will however, provide results that may  allow the client to expand and improve its reforestation effort in the Northern Autonomous Atlantic Region of Nicaragua (RAAN for its initials in Spanish), possibly as part of an energy project that would  reduce the town of Siuna's reliance on fossil fuels for its energy needs (diesel is currently shipped to Siuna and burned to provide energy). 

Assuming that the result of the analysis is a positive recommendation to proceed with the cogeneration plant and that MLR does indeed develop the same, utilization of the recommendations provided by IFC would ultimately increase the likelihood of a successful, environmentally sound, wood and plant-based energy project that would positively affect many farmers and communities in the RAAN by establishing the business case for reforesting degraded lands, reducing emissions leading to climate change, and by protecting standing forests with carbon stocks from conversion to non-forest uses.

-Consumer
 
 Education: to create awareness, for a market to grow and thrive, consumers must know what products are available and understand the value and benefits of these products over what they are currently using (kerosene and candles). Consumers must also be able
 
 to distinguish between good and poor quality products in order to get good value for their scarce resources.

Currently, investors need to wait for a period of at least 334 days in order to get a construction permit.
 
 Alternatively, they need to pay bribes to speed up the process. This situation discourages local and foreign investors and gives way to corruption. There is a pressing need to eliminate unnecessary delays, reduce corruption in issuing permits, and increase
 
 investor interest in the construction sector through the reform and simplification of construction permit issuing process within Kabul Municipality. By establishing a streamlined permit process, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA)
 
 seeks to reduce corruption in this priority area as a step towards transparent institutions dealing with the private sector. In 2012, Transparency Internationals Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) ranked Afghanistan 174 out of 176 countries. Several obstacles
 
 cited by Afghan businesspeople, including access to land, the construction permit issuance process, anti-competitive behavior and tax administration are closely related to corruption.

The objective of this project is to develop a simplified yet effective
 
 construction permit system and regulatory framework that would improve the governments capacity and efficiency in issuing construction permits. By doing so, the private sector will benefit from a reduced burden and cost at the national and sub-national
 levels, 
 through the elimination of the CP bottleneck, which hampers the capacity of the growing Housing Sector in Afghanistan to meet the demand gap. A streamlined CP process would also minimize opportunities for corruption thanks to an improved and increasingly
 transparent 
 process. This would serve as a foundation for boosting the ease of doing business and investors perception. The new CP framework will also establish the framework for the GIRoA to retroactively formalize unpermitted buildings. The project aims
 to reduce the 
 time it takes to obtain construction permits and to improve the capacity of the civil servants operating the CP process. Changes are expected to increase both the efficiency and capacity of the Kabul Municipality to issue construction permits
 and, hence, increase 
 applications under the reformed permits system. In addition, expected savings to the private sector, as a result of the improved system, would be achieved over the longer term of the project. 

The project will provide the technical
 support to:
- Implement 
 and monitor the endorsed simplified new CP manual processes and related reporting package in the City of Kabul to ensure a smooth process flow and make necessary adjustments based on early implementation results. Supported by the
 ICT Global, the Project Team 
 will provide the technical support needed to ensure an adequate selection of the software provider/developer, the delivery and implementation of improved management reporting tools to monitor the CP process workflow.
- Provide
 the necessary legal expertise 
 to support the clients legal functions in drafting the legal framework changes in light of best practices, tailored to the Afghanistan local context and guide the client through consensus-building activities around the reform
 among government officials and 
 private sector players, through consultation and awareness-raising events.

The objective of 2030 WRG is to accelerate water reforms and generate action to ensure water does not become a barrier to economic growth, while ensuring long-term environmental and social sustainability.

In Africa, the current focus countries for 2030 WRG are South Africa (since late 2011), Tanzania (since late 2013), and Kenya (since mid 2014). Country selection has been demand-driven (i.e. via a high level invitation from the government). The scale of water security issues, and presence of 2030 WRG partners in-country, have also influenced the geographic focus.

SOUTH AFRICA
The 2030 WRG engagement in South Africa began in late 2011. With the analysis phase completed, Multi-Stakeholder Platform established (Strategic Water Partners Network), and priority projects identified, the priority over the next two years will be to ensure that this foundation translates into meaningful impacts. The focus for project
development will be in three areas:

1. Water efficiency and leakage reduction. Under this group the primary focus will remain municipal water supply systems. To reduce these losses, 2030 WRG will support the roll out of the No Drop reform program and the development of specific, financially viable water loss reduction projects, including via the testing of the Performance Based Contract toolkit.

2. Effluent and wastewater management. The focus under this working group is mine water management. The first objective will be to establish the institutional and economic viability of mine wastewater reuse PPP projects at catchment and/or mine levels. The Witbank catchment has been selected as a test case.

3. Agricultural and supply chain water. Expected focus topics include (i) the upgrading of the national Water Administration System (bulk irrigation scheduling system), and (ii) use of PPPs for the rehabilitation of large scale irrigation systems. A further objective (which applies to all countries) is to increase high level awareness of water security risks, opportunities, and the benefits of public-private collaboration. Results in this area will be tracked via tailored surveys (see Evaluation Plan section) and other standard indicators, e.g. media appearances, publications, etc (refer planned communications plan, as above).

TANZANIA
2030 WRG has been active in Tanzania since late 2013. With 2,300 cubic meters of water per capita, Tanzania has a relative abundance of water resources at an aggregate level. However, with extremely low level of water storage capacity, and high annual and seasonal rainfall variability, the country faces major constraints in securing sufficient water, in particular for agricultural development.

Indicative planned initiatives include:

- Expanding access to efficient irrigation systems for
emerging/smallholder farmers through aggregated access to finance and awareness raising
- Development of new public-private water stewardship initiatives in high water competition watersheds.

KENYA
Kenya is home to some of the great water towers of East Africa (Mt Kenya, the Aberdares), yet 90 percent of the country is either arid or semi-arid. At an aggregate level, annual renewable freshwater supply is only 650 m3 per capita, well below the threshold for chronic water scarcity. Early 2030 WRG analysis suggests that the scale of planned development, especially irrigation, could lead to a 29% water gap in 2030 unless substantial supply- and demand-side investments are made.

The immediate priorities for Kenya are to: (i) generate further interest and awareness on the water agenda and the concept of a Kenya 2030 WRG partnership, (ii) fully establish the multi-stakeholder platform; and (iii) agree on working group priorities and specific projects/initiatives to develop under the partnership.",,,,,,"This program aims to reduce the water demand-supply gap in select countries in Africa, currently focusing on South Africa, Tanzania and Kenya.

The success of this program will be assessed against:

- New instruments/solutions catalyzed through Multi Stakeholder Platforms (MSPs) and under implementation through third-parties
- Partnerships: MSPs operational with established governance
- Knowledge Development: Development of robust and scientific data and info, incorporating hydro-economic cost-, benefit- and risk-based analysis, to guide the development of solutions

Instruments/solutions will include the launch of new financial products and structures (including via PPPs and other models), new third-party projects (e.g. for new technology uptake), and the enactment of policies, regulations, incentives, and institutional/governance reforms.

Impacts will vary by country according to the specific solutions prioritized by the MSPs, but will always fall within the following four physical impact categories:

- Reduced fresh water abstraction (cubic meters/ year)
- Increased cost-effective water storage (cubic meters)
- Increased agricultural water productivity (project level production ($)/ m3 used)
- Reduced discharge of untreated waste water / polluted water (cubic meters/ year)

To measure the impact on improved water resource management policies and governance, a """"water governance score"""" is included as an additional key impact indicator.

Although national governments serve as the primary clients for 2030 WRG, this program will convene private sector, in addition to governments and civil society, as key actors for implementation, and leverage the strengths of the private sector as a solution provider and innovator.

The program covers activities in line with the 2030 Water Resources Groups (2030 WRG) A-C-T approach of operation:

 (1) Analysis - Developing hydro-economic analysis to highlight the macro water issues and catalyze water sector transformation and collective action; 
(2) Convening - Bringing together public & private sectors, community organizations, development agencies and international organizations in structured discussions for identifying solutions for water resources management through Multi-Stakeholder Platforms and identified workstreams for engagement; 
(3) Transformation - Implementing/ enacting policy, incentives, technical, financial, or governance-related water solutions through local stakeholders.

The choice of priorities and initiatives to champion are determined by the Multi-Stakeholder Platform. 

2030 WRG does not itself implement the identified solutions on the ground. However, it enables the formation of partnerships, identification of implementing entities, and unlocking of funding, in tandem with the members of its Multi-Stakeholder Platforms, so that implementation can be carried out effectively. 

Current program for South Asia covers four engagements  Ganga/ Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Bangladesh.

GANGA/ UTTAR PRADESH:
The Ganga/ U.P. engagement focuses on pollution reduction and water use efficiency:
(a) Municipal & Industrial Wastewater Treatment and Reuse:  (1) Improving the enabling conditions for wastewater treatment and reuse models, and/or (2) area-based wastewater treatment action plans (e.g., Hindon river). 
(b) Agri Water Use Efficiency and Non-Point Source Pollution Reduction: Implementation of good agricultural practices & technologies for area-specific action (e.g., Hindon) covering defined stretches of the river. 

KARNATAKA 
At the request of the Karnataka state government, 2030 WRG has been involved in Karnataka since 2010 to tackle its growing water problems, which are impacting the Krishna and Cauvery river basins, the state's largest and most economically significant basins.

The Karnataka engagement focuses on:
- Agri Water Efficiency: Facilitation of implementation roadmap and financing for technology use in agriculture. 
- Wastewater Reuse Opportunities in Urban-Industrial Settings.

MAHARASHTRA
2030 WRG's Maharashtra engagement was initiated in 2014 to focus on the agriculture sector and grow the state at 4% or more agri-GDP with the same or reduced water consumption. Key planned activities include:
- Technology acceleration in agriculture: Interventions for watershed development and on-farm efficiency in the agriculture sector. 
- Urban-industrial water and wastewater management: Circular economy solutions and improvements to the enabling environment. 

BANGLADESH: 
2030 WRG initiated its Bangladesh engagement in 2013 on the basis of interest expressed by government, industry, and research institutes for its analytical studies. 
Key focus areas include:
- Water Governance: Recommendations for policy reform, institutional capacity building, access to green finance, and improved governance. 
- Greater Dhaka Watershed (GDW) Restoration: Wastewater treatment, and aquifer & wetlands management.
- Agri-Water Efficiency: Introduction of water-efficient practices & technologies, innovative financing mechanisms, and market linkages.",,,,,,"The program aims to reduce the water demand-supply gap in select areas, currently covering the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh/ Ganga in India, as well as Bangladesh.

In this regard, the project will specifically focus on two inter-related objectives:

- Primary Objective: Assist the Government of Basra in protecting and retaining its current investments, preventing potential withdrawals and investor-state disputes, through enhanced regulations and policies, the provision of aftercare services and investor grievance mechanisms.

- Secondary Objective: Assist the Government of Basra in growing investment from existing investors and attracting new, viable investment through strategic promotion efforts and improved regulations, practices and policies.

The project activities ensure the retention and growth of current investors, and the attraction of new investment that can capitalize on the market opportunities offered by Basra in the context of the current environment. The Project will comprise four key components, as follows:

*Component 1: Development of Reform Memorandum Addressing De Jure and De Facto Legal and Regulatory Barriers to Investment:
Building on the analysis conducted under the pre-Implementation stage, the Project will hone in on legal, regulatory, and policy barriers to investment in Iraq, focusing on the subnational implications to Basra.  The outputs will identify targeted reform recommendations to foster private investment and increased competitiveness. 

*Component 2: Strengthening of Investor Protections and Grievance Channels :
This component will target improvements in the quality of investor protection in the domestic investment frameworks, keeping in view the international and regional commitments (integrating the analysis from Component 1).  The assistance will support in the provision of aftercare services and the development of a systemic investor response mechanism (SIRM). SIRM will essentially provide the minimum institutional infrastructure to enable the Government of Basra to identify, track and manage grievances arising between investors and public agencies as early as possible, ultimately preventing investor-State legal disputes. It will ensure that the Government responds to investor grievances in a suitable manner and in accordance with the countrys international investment agreements, laws and regulations. Reforms will need to be implemented to empower a designated Lead Agency within the government to manage the SIRM. In addition, an ICT-tool (either excel based or a software) will be designed to help the Lead Agency (i) record, track and monitor investor grievances; (ii) asses their potential impact on the investment; (iii) inform the grievance resolution process; and (iv) improve the functioning of SIRM through better workflow management. 

 *Component 3: Institutional Strengthening and Development of an Investment Attraction and Retention Strategy for the Basra Investment Commission: 
Work under this component will assist the GOI to (i) define a viable Investment Attraction and Retention strategy for Basra based on sectors for which Basra can be competitive to attract and retain, and including a marketing and outreach plan to target potential investors;  (ii) reform the structure and staffing of the Basra Investment Commission (BIC) to more effectively align with the new strategy and (iii) enhance the capacity and capabilities of the BIC to target viable and sustainable investments.

*Component 4: Knowledge Transfer and Disseminations of Key Learnings from all of the above components:
The Project will consistently build in stakeholder consultations to:
- Ensure alignment on the activities, progress, responsibilities and timeline
- Confirm client buy-in and ownership of the reform process
- Verify pragmatic implementation of reforms in a complex security environment",,,,,,"1-Stregthened investment rules and regulations

678,2030 Water Resources Group LAC,Advisory Services,,Completed,Latin America and the Caribbean,Peru,,,2016-07-15T04:00:00Z,,,,"Background:
2030 WRG is a public-private-civil society partnership, established in 2008. The 2030 WRG represents the coming together of a consortium of corporates, IFC, the World Economic Forum, the UN, individual governments, and international agencies, to elevate water up the global agenda. The objective of 2030 WRG is to accelerate water reforms and generate action to ensure water does not become a barrier to economic growth, while ensuring long-term environmental and social sustainability.
In LAC, the current focus countries for 2030 WRG are Peru (since 2013) and Mexico (since late 2010).  2030 WRG is now scoping new countries in LAC; if a country with a suitable hydro-economic-political context is identified, a third country programme will be started.  Possible countries include Brazil, or Colombia.
Activities under the Project:
PERU:
(1) Economic Incentives for the Efficient Use of Water:
This group will work with the National Water Authority, SUNASS and other government regulatory authorities to develop policies, regulations and economic incentive structures that make water users use water more efficiently; reducing their water footprint; polluting less; and recycling water more. The outputs for this work may be new regulations or best practices adopted by the government; voluntary codes of conduct by industry sectors; or the more effective and widespread communication, implementation and enforcement of current incentives, as appropriate.
(2) Public Private Partnerships for Sustainable Catchment Management
This group will work to streamline the processes by which public-private-civil society alliances can be developed in Peru.  Its strategic outputs could be new regulations, processes or guidelines to facilitate the development of such alliances.
(3)  Innovative Financial Solutions for Water Resources Projects.
2030WRG is working in partnership with the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) and the members of Working Group 3 to develop new financial mechanisms to attract more financial resources into Perus water sector.

This group will map and recommend innovative financial mechanism that could be adopted by Peru, leveraging government funds with private capital, to deliver much needed priority water resources projects.  Specific outputs could be new regulations approved by the Government of Peru (eg the Ministry of Finance) to permit a new investment mechanism.
MEXICO:
Activities under the Project:
1.	Carry out Analytical Work, developing of a tool to prioritise Conagua's investment portfolio, in a transparent and inclusive manner, and applying that tool to 3 hydrological regions of Mexico.
2.	Commission a study to identify key opportunities for 2030WRGs private sector partners to invest in the Mexican Water Sector, and how the enabling environment for such investments can be optimized
3.	Setting up of a Multistakeholder platform in Mexico with Working Groups to identify scope and implement projects that close the national water gap. One possibility is to collaborate with the existing Water Advisory Council (Consejo Consultiva del Agua, CCA), an influential body already convening certain groups of water users to tackle water scarcity challenges in the country.
THIRD COUNTRY:
Initial scoping activities started in July 2015, with a consultant familiar with the water sector in LAC and experienced in WBG water management initiatives reviewing the current landscape of these countries.",,,,,,"This program aims to reduce the water demand-supply gap in select countries in Latin America, currently focusing on Peru & Mexico & Brazil.

Key outcomes from the program that address the identified market barriers will include: (1) launch of new financial products & structures (eg including economic incentives, multi-stakeholder alliances & other models) catalyse new investment in the sector (2) increase in water efficiency through the enactment of policies, regulations, incentives, & institutional/ governance reforms, (3) generation of new water resource information & increased awareness of water resource solutions, and building relationships with hosts to unlock current projects that are stalled.

The program aims to facilitate:
- New instruments/solutions catalyzed through MSPs & under implementation through third-parties
- Partnerships: MSPs operational with established governance structures
- Knowledge Development: Development of robust / scientific data & info, incorporating hydro-economic cost-benefit & risk-based analysis, to guide the development of solutions

Instruments/solutions will include new financial products & structures (eg including economic incentives, multi-stakeholder alliances & other models), new third-party projects (e.g. new technology uptake), & enactment of policies, regulations, incentives, & institutional/governance reforms. Impacts will vary by country according to the specific solutions prioritized by the MSPs, but will always fall within the following 5 impact categories:
- Reduced fresh water abstraction (cubic meters/ year)
- Increased cost-effective water storage (cubic meters)
- Increased agricultural water productivity (sector GDP ($)/ m3 used)
- Reduced discharge of untreated waste water / polluted water (cubic meters/year)
- Increased investment by a water-using sector (eg agriculture, mining, industry, realty) unlocked by the resolution of a water-related bottleneck.

To measure the impact on improved water resource management policies & governance, a """"water governance score"""" is included as an additional key impact indicator. A methodology for this indicator will be developed in time for inclusion in the first PSR cycle.

While governments serve as the primary clients for 2030 WRG, this program convenes private sector, in addition to governments & civil society, as key actors for implementation, & leverage the strengths of the private sector as a solution provider & innovator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,600870,,,Cross-Industry Advisory Services,,2015-09-14T04:00:00Z,

They will also be better prepared to respond to the needs and challenges that may arise from the mining by effectively and responsibly investing the royalties they will receive. 

The aim of the project is to help municipalities improve their governance and empower local leaders so that they can effectively invest the royalties in their communities. The idea is to provide them with a framework so that their discussions are around the needs, challenges and opportunities that mining brings to their localities. Finally,  these tools will set the ground for a real transformation triggered by the presence of mining companies in the region.

The project design has been structured around governance  improvement responding to the following 3 aspects: 
- Responsiveness: Municipalities deliver services consistent with citizen needs and priorities, reacting to impacts and opportunities generated by the presence of mining.
- Responsibility: Municipalities manage their budget effectively in terms of cost and time, improving their practices to manage resources. 
- Accountability: Mayors implement social accountability actions which are driven by; their understanding of the benefits of transparency and the demand of the civil society .

This component will set the key working pieces and will set the basis for achieving the expected impact of this project. This component will seek to enlist mining companies operating in the region in a joint public  private effort under the concept of ""mining acting as a strategic ally of agriculture"". The idea is to help mining become associated with promoting improved productivity and diversification of key crops which will lead to improved food consumption and the raise of farmers income in the region. It will also seek to establish a network of trained agricultural technicians, who can be available for future engagements. 

Work will focus on nurturing the idea of Collective Action to support small farmers needs in a structured way, positioned and permanently nurtured. This will require a coordinated effort between small farmers, mining companies and government agencies (national, regional and local). 

Work will focus on: 
1.1 Put in practice and position a Collective Initiative
1.2 Establish a coordination Mechanism
1.3 Establish a network of Yachachiq

COMPONENT 2: IMPROVING LIVELIHOODS OF RURAL FAMILIES 
This component aims to improve the farm productivity, food availability and the families income in areas impacted by mining operations, so as to generate a better overall environment under which mining companies and agriculture families coexist. This will be done by incorporating culturally suitable farm production technologies, introducing high value and market oriented crops, livestock and poultry; developing peer-to-peer technical assistance activities by using the Yachachiq network, introducing best practices on nutritious food consumption and conducting some market advisory actions and links to potential buyers. Based on an improved productivity of farms, rural families are expected to improve food consumption and increase their income, which will reduce the pressure for mining related job opportunities. 

This components strategy will articulate a successful experience from the Ministry of Social Inclusion, through its program Haku Winay, and implement it under a collective initiative of the mining sector. The impact of this approach will be enhanced and communicated internally and more broadly to key stakeholders in the region. The coordinated participation of mining companies, local, regional and national government organizations will be articulated and coordinated under the Steering Committee.

Using Haku Wiay, a model tested by the government, has several advantages. First, the project has incorporated a gender strategy which recognizes the role of women in their families, with relation to the adoption of new practices in both, their farms and households for improving food consumption practices of their families. Second, the agricultural practices introduced by the program have been culturally adapted to the area and are environmentally friendly (i.e. no use of pesticides or introduction of foreign crops, promote organic production). Finally, in addition to having the endorsement of the government, mining companies feel positive about using a tested approach and having the central government as a key ally on this initiative. 

Work will focus on: 
2.1 Improve farmers productivity and diversification
2.2 Improve food consumption practices
2.3 Promote Market linkages",,,,,,"The project's objective is to provide a working example of a community investment practice that can be adopted collectively by a group of mining companies in Apurimac, a region with high mining potential in Peru. It is expected that such practice, involving a public-private partnership, should help mining companies reduce social risk not only by improving relationships with their surrounding communities, but also by helping companies as a group to develop a positive working relationship with regional stakeholders, conveying a clear message that agriculture can co-exist and progress alongside with mining.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,600369,,,Infrastructure and Natural Resources,,2015-06-02T04:00:00Z,

The objective of 2030 WRG is to accelerate water reforms and generate action to ensure water does not become a barrier to economic growth, while ensuring long-term environmental and social sustainability.

The program covers activities in line with the 2030 Water Resources Groups (2030 WRG) A-C-T approach of operation:

(1) Analysis - Developing hydro-economic analysis to highlight the macro water issues and catalyze water sector transformation and collective action; 

(2) Convening - Bringing together public & private sectors, community organizations, development agencies and international organizations in structured discussions for identifying solutions for water resources management through Multi-Stakeholder Platforms and identified workstreams for engagement; 

(3) Transformation - Implementing/ enacting policy, incentives, technical, financial, or governance-related water solutions through local stakeholders.

 The choice of priorities and initiatives to champion are determined by the Multi-Stakeholder Platform. 

 2030 WRG does not itself implement the identified solutions on the ground. However, it enables the formation of partnerships, identification of implementing entities, and unlocking of funding, in tandem with the members of its Multi-Stakeholder Platforms, so that implementation can be carried out effectively. 

 Current program for East Asia covers two engagements, Mongolia and Vietnam, with a third country under scoping.

 MONGOLIA: 

The Mongolia program focuses on the following workstreams:

1.            Water Demand Reduction & Water Supply Augmentation

2.            Water Valuation and Incentives for Sustainable Water Resources Management

3.            Capacity Building and Collaboration amongst Stakeholders

 VIETNAM: 

2030 WRG has conducted initial scoping missions and met with key government officials and other stakeholders, who endorsed the need for an analysis of Vietnam's water resources. 2030 WRG is conducting a water sector analysis to be guided by a multi-stakeholder advisory group to identify thematic priorities.",,,,,,"This program aims to reduce the water demand-supply gap in select countries in East Asia, currently focusing on Mongolia and Vietnam, with a third country under scoping.

The success of this program will be assessed against:

(I) Instruments/Solutions: New instruments catalyzed through Multi-Stakeholder Partnerships (MSPs) and under implementation through third parties

(II) Partnerships: MSPs operational with established governance

(III) Knowledge Development: Development of robust & scientific info, incorporating hydro-economic cost-, benefit- and risk-based analysis, to guide the development of solutions

Instruments/ solutions towards closing the water gap identified by the MSPs under point (I) above will include:

(i) Demonstration projects to pilot innovative approaches;

(ii) Large-scale programs to unlock investments in infrastructure and technology;

(iii) Policy/ regulatory reforms covering incentives as well as institutional, governance and/ or tariff improvements;

(iv) Optimization of public and private funding through appropriate financing mechanisms.

 Impacts will vary by country according to the specific solutions prioritized by the MSPs, but will always fall within the following four physical impact categories:

(1) Reduced freshwater usage (cubic meters/ year);

(2) Gross agricultural value add per m3 fresh water used ($) (to be normalized for commodity price changes);

(3) Increased cost-effective water storage (cubic meters/ year);

(4) Reduced discharge of untreated wastewater/ polluted water (cubic meters/year). 

To measure the impact on improved water resource management policies and governance, a water governance score is included as an additional key impact indicator. 

Although national governments serve as the """"entry"""" client for 2030 WRG's engagement in any country, this program will convene private sector, in addition to government and civil society, as key actors for the development and implementation of solutions, and leverage the strengths of the private sector as a solution provider and innovator.

This component also aims to build capacity in practical E&S risk management to anticipate, evaluate, and manage cumulative impacts and risks from multiple hydro investments in the same river basin. 

In collaboration with MOEP & MONREC, IFC will assist in:
1) Establishing/developing a policy guideline for addressing environmental and social risk management for the hydropower sector. IFC's support will draw on these experiences to date and GIIP and assist ECD in its preparation. This guideline will build on the new EIA procedures approved by the government. 

2) Technical guidelines on addressing Cumulative Impact Assessments and how to manage impacts from hydropower project will be developed and may be included as part of the hydropower guideline or separate. This will be determined via further consultation with the government and other stakeholders. 

3) Providing support in preparing other guidelines that specifically address impacts of hydropower. This includes guidance on downstream flow regimes,  benefit sharing arrangements, and stakeholder engagement. 

4) Providing capacity building training on IFC's Performance Standards in relation to hydropower projects; promotion of cumulative impact assessment and management; and any guidelines that are formulated under this program. This will be conducted via a series of 2-day modules starting with general overviews of the Performance Standards followed by specific targeted topics relevant to hydropower. 

5) A country-wide strategic environmental assessment will be conducted involving wide-spread stakeholder engagement. This study will include an E&S sensitivity prioritization baseline study of hydropower potential based on sustainability criteria linking to environmental and social criteria such as critical habitats, landscapes and/or tributaries of significance, socially sensitive areas with local communities, etc. 

6) Selected targeted interventions at selected watersheds as demonstration of CIAM / integrated watershed management good practices for multiple/cascading of hydropower projects will be developed.

Component 2: Enable adoption of good industry practice E&S standards by hydropower companies investing in, and developing, hydropower.

This component will focus on providing direct support to hydropower companies to provide them the tools, skills and expertise to develop sustainable projects.  Specific areas for exploration include:

1) Convene a Hydropower Developers' Working Group (HDWG) drawing on the experiences of the Lao HDWG to draw in world class sponsors, improve the capacity of existing developers and provide expertise related to good international industry practices.  The HDWG will provide a space for the private sector to also influence policy by regularly engaging with the government through periodic joint meetings with the Power/Energy Sector Group headed by the Vice President.

2) Provide direct advisory services to the private sector including a) training on the IFC's Performance Standards, b) assessment and training on the environmental and social management system (ESMS); and other areas required by the sector.

Component 3:  Raising public awareness and developing thought leadership and communications on the values of E&S sustainability standards in the hydropower sector are critical to the success of the program IFC will i) educate the public of E&S good international industry practices in E&S standards; ii) empower the public by providing access to platforms of influence and dialogue spaces; iii) position IFC as a credible, competent, responsible advisor in the hydro sector. A range of tools will be developed such as: videos, fact sheets, expanded website and print and online materials.",,,,,,"The overall goal of the program is to increase the share of new private sector investments in the Myanmar hydro sector that adhere to good international industry practice environmental and social standards by 2020. This will be accomplished through an integrated programmatic approach by partnering with the Government of Myanmar (GOM), hydropower companies, regional banks and civil society organisations. Specifically:

a. GOM will have improved the regulatory environment for the hydropower sector. IFC will build GOM capacity to implement and monitor changes in policy.

envisioned to provide support to Central and State Government departments in
undertaking reform on Doing Business indicators as well as on broader business
regulations not covered in the Doing Business agenda. During conception and
preimplementation, the project focused on all aspects of the full reform value
chain, including:&nbsp;-
Helping Government departments understand WHAT TO REFORM;-
Assisting Government departments to understand HOW TO REFORM;-
Supporting IMPLEMENTATION OF REFORM through the provision of advisory services;-
Providing support to MONITOR AND EVALUATE REFORMS; and-
Supporting the SUSTAINABILITY OF REFORM through the establishment of
institutional structures and other mechanisms.&nbsp;During pre-implementation, the
teams work led to a number of important results and lessons:-
The development of a DB Reform Memorandum in December 2014 provided the
Government with a clear understanding of what needed to be reformed to improve
on the DB indicators.-
The development of a detailed DB Reform Action Plan based on the Reform
Memorandum through consultation with Government andprivate
sector in July 2015 informed the Government on how to sequence and bring about
reforms.-
Inputs from these exercises allowed the Government to implement reforms in the
Starting a Business and Getting Electricity indicators in Doing Business 2016,
leading to India's first improvement in rank since the 10 indicators were
introduced.-
These inputs and further consultations also allowed the Government to develop
and circulate business reform action plans for all states to implement,
covering a wider range of areas outside of Doing Business.-
The circulation of the State Business Reform Action Plans, coupled with a
report prepared with the teams support that ranked states on business reform
implementation, has stimulated states to undertake a wide-ranging reform
program.-
Central and State Government departments have already employed consultants to
implement the reforms, thus removing the need fordirect
advisory support on all reforms. Instead, departments have reached out to the
team for knowledge on global best practices to help guide reforms, as well as
advice on specific reform areas, e.g. on construction permits.&nbsp;Since pre-implementation activities
have already led to a detailed understanding on what and how to reform, the
project implementationstrategy
has therefore been carefully readjusted to focus on only the following parts of
the reform value chain:-
Assisting Government departments to understand HOW TO REFORM;-
Providing support to MONITOR AND EVALUATE REFORMS;and-
Supporting the SUSTAINABILITY OF REFORM through the establishment of
institutional structures and other mechanisms.This
work will be carried out on two fronts: first, with a view to supporting
improvement on the DB indicators, and second in stimulating broader reform at
the state level.&nbsp;Component 1: Supporting
Reforms to Improve Doing Business IndicatorsThe December 2015 DB
Reform Memo and the July 2015 disaggregated DB Reform Action Plan provides
clear guidance to DIPP and to implementing departments on what to reform and
how to bring about the reforms. However, DIPP and implementing departments
require additional support in understanding global good practice in each of the
reform areas, as well as institutions to coordinate and decide on reforms that
span across multiple departments. The focus in this component is therefore to
provide knowledge on global best practices to help stimulate reform design,
support DIPP in monitoring reforms, and assist in developing institutional
structures to successfully implement reforms and sustain the reform momentum.
Additionally, specific reform ideas may emerge from these activities that can
further be added to the reformaction plan over time.
Specifically the team will focus on the following activities:1. Ensure effective
implementation through proposed Task Forces:



























































The pro Indicator",,,,,,"The overall goal of the project is to catalyze business regulation reform in India by capacitating key change agents. This will be done by institutionalizing a reform agenda within key entities that govern business regulations, both on Doing Business indicators, as well as broader business regulation, and by achieving quick win regulatory reforms in key states to build a case for further state-level reform adoption.

Specifically, the project will achieve the following by project completion:
a) DIPP will institutionalize DB reform program through the creation of task force(s), reform monitoring team(s) and other mechanisms to stimulate reforms at the central and state government levels;
b) At least two states will develop reform action plans based on implementing best practices informed by the knowledge products prepared by the project

around US$ 60m. The transport infrastructure component would be financed by the
GoS under loans from the World Bank, while the transport equipment and systems
component will fall under the remit of the private operator for the envisaged
PPP. IFC's mandate will be structured around 2 phases: Phase 1 (analyses and structuring) to analyze institutional,
economic and environmental & social aspects as well as undertake detailed
technical and legal due diligence, commercial and tariff analyses and financial
modelling. During this phase, a proposed structuring of the transaction will be
discussed with GoS. Once the Government makes a decision, phase 2
(implementation) can start with marketing to potential investors, and
preparation of tender until the selection of an Operator for the BRT.

",,,,,,"The identified pilot line stretches for 19km from Guediawaye to downtown Dakar It is expected to decrease average travel time by 50% from 95 to 47 minutes, with approximatively 500,000 people deserved by the pilot BRT corridor by 2025. This represents around 30% of the total trips on the future mass public transport network (BRT plus TER).

The primary purpose for this initiative is to relieve the existing roads of their heavy congestion. The project will also be positive for the urban design and planning of the city. It will lead to a renewal of the downtown harbor, reconfiguration of the suburbs, and help to limit urban sprawl. From this project, it is expected an improvement of the availability and reliability of public transportation.

The direct long term benefits will include an increase in urban productivity and reduction in the city center pollution. More indirect benefits will include the appreciation of land value along the main routes served and the potential for further development of commercial and real estate activities.","<table><tbody><tr><th>Indicator</th><th>Results (CY - 2017)</th><th>Cumulative</th></tr><tr><td>Number of agreements (concession, etc.) signed</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Number of bids conducted</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Number of reports accepted by client</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Number of successful bids</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Number of reports (assessments, surveys, manuals, Phase I/strategic option reports) completed</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Number of people receiving access to improved services (real/non-financial sectors)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,601344,,,Cross-Industry Advisory Services,,2016-02-24T05:00:00Z,2016-03-01T05:00:00Z

The program focuses on two major types of engagements: namely company level engagements and sector level engagements.
More specifically the Program will advise (i) IFC clients and other selected companies on the feasibility of new renewable energy projects in the local markets, and by supporting rehabilitation and efficiency improvements for existing generation and other energy infrastructure assets, but also (ii) work at sector level and strive to engage with groups of companies, energy associations, public institutions, equipment suppliers and other key private and public market/sector level stakeholders, to create new market opportunities and remove specific market barriers hindering the development of efficient and sustainable power and districting heating markets.
Under first type of engagements, advisory support for renewable generation and rehabilitation of existing power and district heating plants may include development/preparation/revision of: (i) RE project documentation, (ii) environmental studies, (iii) financing models, (iv) RE projects risk assessment, (v) analysis of regulatory frameworks and country resource potentials, mapping of local partners, etc. 
Under second type of engagements, the Program will focus on sector level activities that have the potential to promote cooperation and collective action by private sector players.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, SMEs make up more than 95 percent of all firms and excluding the ones operating in the informal sector. SME growth has the potential to provide millions with economic and development opportunities in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, this is often hampered by SMEs inability to grow to full commercial potential and/or engage in the value chains of larger corporates. According to the IFC/World Bank Enterprise Survey 2006-2010, the constraints most cited by SMEs in Sub-Saharan Africa include: Access to electricity; Access to finance; Business environment; Technical and business skills and Awareness of market standards and opportunities.

This project responds primarily to demand from Financial Institutions for support to maximize the reach and effectiveness of Non-Financial Services (""NFS"") to SMEs. The project will directly support FIs, Real sector corporates, groups of firms, Implementing partners and Key Stakeholders to create an Ecosystem that qualifies and sustains the growth of SMEs to access markets/value chains and suitable finance. Specifically, IFC will partner with:  1) Financial Institutions to enhance the readiness of SMEs to engage with both FIs and Real Sector clients by providing them customized advisory services through those FIs and Real Sector Clients; 2) Real sector corporate clients directly or Corporates on the portfolio of FIs to improve the performance of the SMEs in their value chains; 3) Intermediaries and stakeholders in CASA/FCS to improve the SME Ecosystem to access markets/value chains, skills development and access to finance and 4) Business Development Services Providers and other institutions to strengthening their capacity to provide better services to Corporates and to SMEs.",,,,,,"This program is expected to contribute to SME development through the provision of:

More than 65 percent of Myanmar's population has no access to grid-based energy services.  In rural areas, more than two thirds of households rely on candles, kerosene, batteries and diesel generators to meet their energy needs.  To address this, the Government of Myanmar, with the assistance of the World Bank Group and other donors, has adopted the National Electrification Plan (NEP), which aims to achieve universal access to sustainable electricity services by 2030 through a combination of grid extension and off-grid programs. 

The potential for commercial approaches to help meet this goal is strong, particularly in off-grid, and the NEP recognizes the need for private investment.  However, there are market challenges that have prevented deeper private involvement in Myanmar's off-grid sector, including: (1) insufficient market knowledge among private sector players; (2) lack of information for consumers on the quality of solar products; and (3) limited availability of financing for end consumers and companies.  Lighting Myanmar will support international and Myanmar-based companies to overcome these challenges and create a sustainable market for high-quality off-grid energy solutions, including solar lanterns, solar home systems, and potentially mini-grids. 

Drawing from experience in other Lighting Global programs, Lighting Myanmar will work with lighting product manufacturers, distributors, financial institutions, development partners, and the government in six areas: 
1. Quality assurance. The Lighting Global product quality standards were developed under Lighting Africa and have now been adopted as the international standards for off-grid solar lighting products. Lighting Myanmar will support the introduction of products meeting these standards in Myanmar and will work with government agencies and others to promote adoption of these standards where appropriate. 
2. Market intelligence. The project will conduct in-depth research on the off-grid market to inform the market strategies of Lighting Global Associates and their local partners. 
3. Business development support. This includes a number of activities to help Lighting Global Associates build productive partnerships in the market, including identifying potential local partners (e.g. distributors, retailers, financial institutions) and advising on strategies for entering the market. 
4. Consumer awareness. One of the core pillars of the project is implementation of widespread consumer awareness campaigns to stimulate demand for quality-verified off-grid lighting products. These will include multiple delivery channels, drawing on the experience from other Lighting programs. 
5. Regulatory and policy dialogue. To encourage policies that are supportive of private involvement in the market, Lighting Myanmar will engage in a dialogue with a range of government actors, as well as international development partners, on issues including subsidies, tariffs, and quality standards.  
6. Access to Finance. Lighting Myanmar will seek to address financing barriers, both for companies and end consumers, by working with local and international financial institutions to increase their involvement and develop solutions for the sector.",,,,,,"The goal of Lighting Myanmar is to support the creation of a sustainable commercial market for high-quality off-grid energy solutions in Myanmar.

It will do so by adopting an inclusive, multi-stakeholder approach to build capacity among local government, civil society, and the private sector to enable the adoption of good international industry practices of E&S standards. The program will also aim to address the overall governance of the entire Jhelum-Poonch watershed including laying foundations for institutional arrangements for integrated river basin management and commission important scientific studies to address data gaps including surveying of tributaries with significant data gaps and conducting environmental flows assessments in the watershed. 

The program focuses on two interlinked components over the two year period:
Component 1: Improve and enable application of good practice E&S standards to manage cumulative impacts of the cascade of hydropower projects in the Jhelum-Poonch watershed for sustainable hydropower development and strategic watershed management:

Ultimately this effort expects to help local authorities, together with project sponsors, academia, and environmental NGOs, achieve sustainable hydropower development and integrated watershed management of the Jhelum-Poonch Basin. The overall approach agreed includes: 

-Creation of offsets in the form of new protected areas in the watershed to secure appropriate conditions for the long term survival of key species . 
-Coordination of environmental flow management, focusing on adequate releases from dams, when feasible avoid peaking operation, and coordinated flushing of sediments.
-Preparation of guidelines and procedures for impact assessment, monitoring and adaptive management for all HPP in this watershed. 
-Development and strengthening capacity of key institutions, as the strategy will not succeed without strong institutions that have the legal mandate for protection of environment and biodiversity, and 
-Design of financial mechanisms to assure long term sustainability.

Component 2: Establish multi-stakeholder platforms (MSPs) to enable capacity in practical E&S risk management and adoption of IFCs Performance Standards.
This component will focus on the development of training materials and implementation of training events to provide technical support and capacity development to local government officials, civil society and the private sector (hydropower developers, consultants and EPC contractors) operating in the Jhelum and Indus watersheds.  This component provides the necessary foundations for the overall governance work to be implemented under Component 1. Specific areas of support include: (i) good international industry practices (GIIP) on hydropower and understanding of the IFC Performance Standards, (ii) cascade and sediment management, (iii) downstream flow regimes, (iv) biodiversity conservation and strategy implementation, (v) stakeholder engagement, (vi) labor and security issues, particularly in the context of local communities and livelihoods, and (vii) fish ladder, passes, hatcheries and re-stocking practices.

IFC will also support the formation of a Hydropower Developers Working Group and promote additionality to potential or existing IFC investment clients to enable the private sector adopt good international industry practices in E&S standards for the hydropower sector.

The project is directly coordinating with and complementary to two other WBG projects involved in the development of the dairy sector in Issyk-Kul region  (1) IFC Central Asia Agri-finance project, with the goal to improve access to finance for farmers, MSMES and aggregators, and improve competitiveness and access to markets for dairy value chain, and (2) IBRD Integrated Dairy Productivity Improvement Project with the goal to enhance dairy animal productivity and milk quality on beneficiary farms.
The proposed project seeks to create an effective regulatory environment necessary to attract investment to the dairy sector and increase the quantity and quality of milk for domestic and export markets. There will be several categories of clients:
1.	The central government and line ministries  the Ministry of Economy, as responsible for all regulatory policy, the Ministry of Agriculture, as responsible for agrisector development, the Ministry of Health, as responsible for human health and involved in FS control.
2.	Specialized agencies  the Veterinary and Phytosanitary inspectorate, the Sanitary Department, the Standardization committee.
3.	Regional authorities  the regional governors office, the regional branches of the above mentioned agencies.
4.	Public Private Dialogue platforms  national (Investment Council) and regional.
5.	Private sector  business associations, processors and primary producers in Issyk-Kul region.
The project will consist of four main components.
1.	Improvement of the business environment in the agrisector.
Under this component, the project will work on general regulatory improvement in the sector.
2.	Institutional reform in the area of the animal health.
The project will work on regulatory and capacity building support for the creation of a unique zone, free of certain animal diseases, in Issyk-Kul region. 
3.	Investment policy and promotion for the dairy sector. 
This sub-component will focus on improving the investment policy framework and introduction of modern investment promotion tools in the region, particularly on those issues, which are more relevant to investment in the selected sector - dairy (and meat as a linked subsector). Limited capacity among government officials to work with investors is another constraint that will be addressed through this component. 
4.	The project will also facilitate growth and sustainability of dairy sector in Issyk-Kul region through creation and implementation of the well-organized Public Private Dialogue (PPD). PPD is given high priority and significant attention for two reasons: (i) it is the key to ensure buy-in on the reform program by the public and private sectors as well as to identify follow up reform priorities, and (ii) it establishes a platform for the ongoing sustainability of the program after the specific World Bank Group assistance ends. While the Project will focus on a regional dairy PPD platform, this platform can be utilized across sectors to promote wider development of the Issyk-Kul region.
PPD will also help ensure reforms are properly implemented by providing a regular platform to identify, monitor, and respond to issues of poor implementation

To address the refugee crisis, IFC proposes to support The Lebanese Association for Development (Al-Majmoua), the leading and largest microfinance institution who has been trying to implement activities that benefit Syrian refugees and hosting communities in Lebanon by helping these institutions to develop new products that cater to the needs of these unique segments of the population. 
Under this project, IFC proposes to support Al-Majmoua through the development of two products: 
-Very Small Enterprise (VSE) Product Development: IFC will support Al-Majmoua in scaling up their lending to Very Small Enterprises (VSEs) with a particular focus on host communities, which will in turn directly or indirectly increase employment opportunities for the hosting communities including the Syrian refugees. 
-Very small equity Product Development: IFC will also support Al-Majmoua in developing a very small equity product that can be targeted at both Syrian refugees and host communities. This idea emerged as a result of the fact that Al-Majmoua (under a project with UNHCR which is coming to an end), has already been working with women from the hosting communities and Syrian refugees to do embroidery work and has given the women the required machinery to do so as a grant. In order to make this a more sustainable and scalable initiative, IFC will work with Al-Majmoua to design and pilot a very small equity product whereby they provide an asset, share revenues with the asset holder and allow the asset holder to gradually buy the assets.",,,,,,"The project will support Al Majmoua to develop, design and pilot two new financing products, one of them being the very small enterprise (VSE) lending product, to cater to the needs of Syrian refugees and hosting communities in Lebanon .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,601826,,,Financial Institutions Group,,2017-01-12T05:00:00Z,2017-01-01T05:00:00Z

Component 3.  Notice and Comment Systems:  Such mechanisms will help increase regulatory predictability and enhance the quality of regulatory design by leveraging the knowledge of the citizen and private sector in the formulation of regulations.   A focused approach to introducing Notice and Comment systems in developing countries will be developed covering integration of technical, regulatory and institutional, user mobilization and M&E dimensions, and piloted in 4-5 countries.  

Component 4: Business-to-Government Feedback Mechanisms on Reform Implementation:  These will generate just-in-time information on the quality of reform implementation and will be customized to specific regulatory reforms. The findings can trigger corrective actions by government to close implementation gaps, with the effectiveness of such actions verified through follow-on surveys.  

Component 5;  Systemic Investor Response Mechanism (SIRM):   The SIRM has two main elements:1) implementation of a protocol designed to enable the administration to coordinate its agencies to timely react and catch and resolve investors' grievances well before they escalate to legal disputes and 2) implementation of an ICT tool to track the investment at risk of being lost due to government conduct that is afterwards retained. 

Component 6;  Closing the Implementation Gap and Uncertainty of G2B Services (CGU):  In some countries a lack of trust between the private and public sectors may hinder the collection of information on excessive discretionary behavior through feedback loops or surveys.  The CGU approach can address this issue by developing an evidence base of objective data at the point of service delivery (i.e. the contact point between firms and the public agency) and support governments in developing performance measures based on the findings.  The CGU work will measure the actual experience during those interactions based on objectively verifiable statistics (e.g. originating from tracking actual case files) compared to relevant regulations.",,,,,,"The purpose of this project, which is part of the WBGs Good Regulatory Practices (GRP) program, is to help governments enhance the quality of regulatory regimes and their outcomes and put in place effective, transparent, accountable and consultative reform processes that assist in reform prioritization, design, and implementation.  

The expected outcomes are as follows:

a) Effective Notice and Comment systems and evidence-based policy-making in several countries, leading to good quality regulations and increased regulatory predictability.

b) Business-to-Government feedback loops in several countries in order to monitor implementation quality, thus helping to improve quality of regulatory reform implementation in these countries.

c) Systematic Investment Response Mechanism in several countries, leading to corrective actions by governments to address investor grievances, thereby helping to increase investment retention and further expansion.

d) More uniform application of regulations and enhanced predictability of service delivery.

These outcomes are expected to lead to increased regulatory quality which, in turn, leads to increased investment, job creation and productivity gains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,601780,,,Trade and Competitiveness,,2016-12-21T05:00:00Z,2017-01-01T05:00:00Z

883,Ethiopia MDI CCF,Advisory Services,,Active,Africa,Ethiopia,,,2018-06-04T04:00:00Z,,,,"The project will focus on the following two components:

1.	Developing Commodity Collateralized Financing (CCF) for Agricultural commodities not mandated to be traded at the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX)
2.	Developing Commodity Collateralized Financing (CCF) for industrial goods (raw material or processed goods) in warehouses in or linked to companies in industrial parks 

Component 1 - Developing CCF for agricultural commodities not mandated to be traded at the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX) 

Agriculture accounts for more than three quarters of employment, forty percent of output, and a third of total exports in Ethiopia (90 percent of goods exports). Currently, Agricultural financing is largely limited to a few commercial farms in export oriented sectors. However, the prospect for CCF for agricultural commodities is enormous given the fact that a number of smallholder farmers are already organized under marketing cooperatives and unions trading in bulk of commodities. According to the Federal Cooperatives Agency, there are 41,985 primary cooperatives nationally with a total coverage of 7.03 million smallholder farmers. These cooperatives are organized under 278 unions.

A product like CCF would enable unions to strengthen their negotiation power in the market by allowing them to defer sales until they are offered reasonable prices. It can enable them to pay their members without having to wait for the actual sales of the products. The fact of securing financing against food crop inventories also contributes to food security by a) increasing local food processing capacity; b) reducing post-harvest losses through better storage; c) contributing to improving quality of the stored goods under better conditions; and d) potentially improving prices for farmers. At the producer level, warehouses for Apex Cooperative organizations could be used to promote better storage and more orderly marketing of crops for the benefit of small holder farmers.  At the processing level, collateral management and stock monitoring services would enable processors to secure needed inventories through-out the crop year and provide them with liquidity so they could offer better prices to farmers.  

The project will partner with the Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA) to promote the use of CCF for agricultural commodities under this component. 

Component 2 - Developing CCF for industrial goods (raw material or processed goods) in warehouses in or linked to companies in industrial parks

The favorable prospects for CCF are further stressed by the governments recent emphasis on the importance of developing Industrial Parks (IPs) mainly aimed at attracting foreign investors. Eight industrial parks have been established so far (4 privately developed and 4 government owned); two of which are focused on textiles/garments. In addition to these industrial parks, there are plans to establish integrated agro-industrial parks focusing on processing of agricultural commodities. The first of such parks is due to open in 12 to 18 months. In such parks opportunities will arise to finance inventories.  For example, agro-processors (producing wheat flour, animal feed, edible oils, beer, etc.) usually need to hold crop inventories for processing, which could be used for collateral for financing by banks. Similarly companies in industrial parks could use raw or processed goods as collateral for funding. For the textile/garment industrial park in Hawassa, while the companies in the park are well established international firms (from China, Sri Lanka, India, Indonesia, Hong Kong, etc.) and may not need local financing, their local Ethiopian suppliers are likely to be facing access to finance constraints and inventory financing could provide a solution.

The project will work with the Ethiopia Investment Commission to explore the prospects of CCF in the context of IPs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,601298,,,Other,,2017-07-28T04:00:00Z,2017-09-01T04:00:00Z

Pillar 1: Improving business environment to spur competitiveness

Under this Pillar, the project will address selected core constraints to the business environment. It is targeting the foundations of the investment climate in (a) reforming the property rights regime, a leading constraint for private investment in the country, and (b) strengthening the dysfunctional commercial justice system, improving in particular the quality of judicial processes, as measured by DB.

In Benin, only 1.6 million people (28 percent of the rural and semi-urban population) currently have access to water through piped water systems (PWSs). In 2006, the government of Benin launched reforms in the rural water sector that transferred the management of 46 percent of the existing PWSs from local communities to private operators under public-private partnership (PPP) contracts to improve operational accountability and quality of service. 
The government wants to build upon this success and to address several challenges subsequently identified, including: high-levels of non-revenue water issues, the need for an improved risk allocation, and measures to mitigate private operators' potential inability to raise funding.
This IFC advisory project will address these issues by scaling-up the approach developed by IFC and the World Bank's 2014 Water and Sanitation Program (WSP), which developed four rural water concessions as part of a pilot initiative to increase the introduction of PPPs in the sub-sector.
Through this project, IFC will provide strategic support to the Ministry of Water as it implements PPPs on 60 PWSs. The project will be developed under a World Bank lending project. To ensure the sustainability of the model, and to guarantee its roll-out across the country, an international consulting firm will train and supervise six local firms/advisors that will execute the transactions with the municipalities, with each transaction representing a cluster of five PWSs.",,,,,,"

The project aims to create new markets for private investment in the agribusiness sector of Ghana.  The project builds directly on the findings of the recent Country Private Sector Diagnostic (CPSD), conducted by the World Bank Group, which identifies agribusiness as one of the most promising economic sectors in Ghana.  Based on an assessment of the market barriers, pre-implementation findings, and comparative advantages of IFC, the project will focus on the following three components: (i) investment promotion to identify and proactively support the entry of responsible agribusiness investors, (ii) addressing key regulatory reforms, and (iii) promotion of agri-service market opportunities.

Component 1: Investment Promotion - Supporting entry of new, responsible agribusiness investors
The project will begin by supporting the Government of Ghana to ensure that the pre-conditions are in place for new investors.

Activities
1.1 Pre-screen potential projects with knowledgeable internal specialists and agribusiness professionals, to ensure the necessary physical, regulatory and financial conditions are in place to attract investors 
1.2 Support the Government in the development and targeted dissemination of investor-oriented business models and information packs that will provide the core country, value chain and/or project specific information needed to generate investor interest 
1.3 Develop a portfolio of investment opportunities for agricultural products / value chains, selected on the basis of an extensive assessment of market opportunities (national, regional and global levels) and value chain competitive potential
1.4 Support the development of a pipeline of potential investors known by IFC to have interests in high value agricultural production / services, in collaboration with the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) and the Ghana Investment Promotion Center (GIPC)
1.5 Provide technical support to MoFA and GIPC for the company-specific follow up support that will be required by investors that are interested in pursuing the opportunities 
1.6 Convene investor roundtables (jointly with Government and WB) to market the opportunities to investors that have expressed interest based on initial outreach and roadshows by the government

Component 2: Sector regulatory reform 
Key challenges in the regulatory system related to private investment in agribusiness include, for example, importation and distribution of basic inputs, as well as Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary (SPS) issues related to previous restrictions on certain exports from Ghana.  The project will support public-private dialogue on these and other regulatory issues, in order to drive reforms. 

Activities:
2.1 Strengthen existing public-private dialogue mechanisms in collaboration with the World Bank in order to identify and promote opportunities for reforms that will help crowd in private financing.
2.2 Undertake a detailed assessment of the SPS system to identify the state of the system, gaps and specific advisory needs (further detailed activities to follow this assessment).    

Component 3  Promotion of agri-service market opportunities
Linked to the first two components, it was highlighted in the CPSD that Ghana has a range of untapped opportunities to attract private sector participation in agricultural services, including the provision of storage, transportation, cold chain and quality-control solutions.  

Activities
3.1 Assess local service market needs: conduct a mapping of market players in the agri-services sector
3.2 Explore opportunities to mobilize entry of new service providers, including via targeted investor events",,,,,,"The objective of the Invest Ghana: Agribusiness Competitiveness Advisory Project (Invest Ghana) is to create new markets for private investment in the agribusiness sector in Ghana.  The project is under the umbrella of the Invest West Africa program, a regional initiative financed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by IFC.  The project will target new private investment in the agribusiness sector.  Outcomes tracked will include the number of commitments by private companies to invest, and the number of regulatory reforms enacted. 

Recognizing that combined public and private sector engagement is critical to alleviate the key market failures, the project will link IFC and World Bank efforts to unlock commercial agribusiness opportunities in Ghana. The project also represents an effort to operationalize the findings of the recent Country Private Sector Diagnostic, conducted by the World Bank Group, which identifies agribusiness as one of the most promising sectors for IFC in Ghana.

Kenya' s population is young and urbanizing rapidly, putting strong pressure on housing needs. Three quarters of the total population, estimated at 45m, is below 35 years and the country has one of the fastest urban growth rates in the region in 2021 it recorded a growth of 4.3%. The Kenya Bureau of Statistics, in 2018, estimated that 61% of urban households live in slums (compared to 50% and 23% in Nigeria and South Africa respectively). This elevated rate is attributed to rapid urbanization leading to overcrowding and lack of access to basic services. Further in urban centers, 56% of the households (average size 4) live in one single-roomed houses while less than 19% own homes. Urban centers face a shortage of 200,000 housing units annually whereas only 50,000 new housing units are supplied annually, mainly by the private sector. In housing shortages, vulnerable groups like women, children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities are most at risk.

The project will contribute to the newly elected Government's affordable housing goal and provide an opportunity to other counties in Kenya with similar affordable housing challenges develop a scalable housing product.

IFC's advisory mandate is being rolled out in two phases:
1) Phase 1: the project preparation which entails a detailed due diligence covering legal, technical, environmental, and social, commercial, and financial aspects to develop a project structure; and
2) Phase 2, the tender phase where a private party will be procured to develop the project",,,,,,The successful implementation of the project is expected to result in the mobilization of private sector investment and delivery of affordable housing units to eligible individuals under the Government's affordable housing program.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,605922,,,Transaction Advisory,,,2022-08-30T04:00:00Z

It is one of IFC's first such engagements in India and reflects the importance of supporting the greening of local infrastructure by engaging with subnational entities, including municipalities and cities, as well as state-level entities.

KIIFB is the designated primary entity for financing all large public infrastructure projects in Kerala, with a major portion of its pipeline allocated to urban infrastructure. In addition to financing, KIIFB also has a mandate to appraise projects and oversee construction, whilst the projects themselves are implemented and operated by other State agencies and related entities.

The project covers the following components:

- Component 1 - E&S Capacity Building: IFC will help improve KIIFB's capacity to address environmental and social (E&S) risks. This includes the assisting in the development of Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) and Environmental and Social Management Systems (ESMSs), including gender-based violence and harassment (GBVH), a building code compliance review and a chlorine leak risk assessment for water treatment plants.

- Component 2 - Green Finance Framework: IFC will accompany KIIFB in designing a Green Finance Framework to help it attract green financing and support KIIFB on getting a second opinion on the framework to confirm alignment with the Green Loan Principles and Green Bond Principles. A Green Finance Framework and its application can demonstrate to the market the integrity of KIIFB in and commitment towards green financing by establishing transparent guiding principles for the selection and evaluation of projects.

- Component 3 - Resilience: IFC will help mainstream climate resilience considerations into KIIFB's operations. Amongst others, this will be achieved through helping the development of an overarching Climate Resilience Policy, promoting the inclusion of climate resilience information into KIIFB's project appraisal and funding process, conducting a series of general climate and sector-specific trainings to engineering teams, as well as developing a climate information depository.

IFC also provides advice to facilitate the certification of several hospitals as green buildings, using IFC's own certification tool EDGE and a third-party certification process. Related activities are led by IFC's EDGE Green Buildings Program and through a separate project.",,,,,,"The overarching objectives of the project are as follows:

IFC aims to help KIIFB strengthen its Environmental & Social risk management practices, in line with IFC's Performance Standards. 

Moreover, IFC aims to build KIIFB's capacity for financing green and resilient infrastructure projects in the future. This includes helping KIIFB integrate climate resilience considerations into its project pipeline, as well as helping it to develop a Green Finance Framework in line with international good practices.

Overall, it is thus expected that the project will help send a strong market signal that Green financing is possible at the State level in India. It will further help KIIFB establish itself as the primary state vehicle for funding green/climate-compatible and resilient infrastructure in Kerala State.

The Platform offers two approaches to support clients depending on their needs and priorities: (1) Workforce Productivity & Operational Efficiency: This approach provides an assessment (based on Lean manufacturing and Lean management concepts) that helps clients understand where they are situated vis-a-vis global best practices with regards to their workforce productivity and overall operational efficiency, including recommendations for improvements, followed by coaching support to help clients prioritize actions and kickstart implementation. (2) Gender & Inclusive Workplaces: This approach provides gender and employment assessments, including recommendations for improvements, followed by in-depth customized advisory services, to help clients understand their unique business case for investing in gender-smart employment solutions and working conditions favorable to women and diverse groups. In addition, through the Workforce Platform, IFC provides thought leadership through case studies, blogs, events and research to create and disseminate sector-specific information on how the private sector can actively develop and benefit from inclusive workforce solutions that enhance their productivity and operational efficiency.",,,,,,"The overall goal of the Workforce Platform is to support IFC clients in manufacturing, agribusiness and services industries to create more productive and inclusive workplaces through improved employee engagement, career development opportunities for women and diverse groups, inclusive and gender-sensitive policies and overall improvements in operational efficiency. This will be achieved through assessments, advisory, and knowledge creation and dissemination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,607207,,,"Manufacturing, Agribusiness & Services",,2022-05-30T04:00:00Z,2022-07-01T04:00:00Z
952,One Acre Fund Agri Insurance,Advisory Services,,Active,Africa,Kenya,,,2022-10-13T04:00:00Z,,,,"Activities under the project will be organized around three main components:

COMPONENT 1: ESTABLISHMENT OF A RISK MANAGEMENT/PARTICIPATION VEHICLE

The main goal of this component is to enable 1AF to streamline its insurance operations for better time and cost efficiency. Centralized insurance financing would also allow for the pooling of risk across different countries (diversification benefits).

COMPONENT 2: PRODUCT AND CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT

To address the need for 1AF to develop new high quality climate/index insurance products for its farmers, IFC will:
1.	Support 1AF in the acquisition of data that can facilitate more accurate index insurance product development. This includes farmer GPS and remote sensing data.
2.	Provide technical advisory for the development of new insurance products by 1AF. This may include technical review of products developed by 1AF and its other partners, and advice on the establishment of a robust basis risk validation process for index-based insurance products. It may also include the exploration of a corporate-level index-based product, covering 1AF's entire credit portfolio.
3.	Train 1AF staff on agri insurance product evaluation and the management of the proposed risk management/participation vehicle.

COMPONENT 3: HIGH-VALUE INSURANCE TRIAL

1AF's current insurance arrangement only covers 50-60% of the cost of inputs loaned to the farmers. The organization would like to conduct research to estimate the level of coverage that would most contribute to higher farmer resilience (without over-insuring the farmer), i.e., should insurance cover the full value or a certain percentage of the expected yield? In addition, how much premium can farmers afford for the ideal coverage? What metrics should be used to measure farmers' improved resilience? 1AF would then like to use the results to gradually transition its farmers from input-based insurance to this 'high-value' insurance.

IFC will support 1AF in addressing this need by mobilizing resources for a controlled trial in one country (possibly Malawi). This trial will seek to test the impact of different insurance coverage levels on farmer resilience. It will also establish the most ideal metrics to use in measuring farmer resilience to climate risk. Study findings will be made public and could potentially be applied by other stakeholders with an interest in promoting access to resilience-building instruments for the agricultural sector.

A research firm will be competitively selected to design and monitor this study for at least 3 cropping seasons (between 2022 and 2025).
",,,,,,"The overall objective of this project is to improve access to quality climate insurance by farmers benefitting from One Acre Fund's agri-financing and advisory bundle. This would ultimately enhance their resilience to climatic and related shocks. More specifically, the project will seek to achieve the following:

1.	Establish a risk management/participation vehicle that would allow One Acre Fund to centralize its insurance operations, have greater flexibility in product options for its farmers, and allow farmers to benefit from the diversification and other cost saving benefits of such a set up.
2.	Facilitate the launch of at least 1 new insurance product based on emerging remote sensing data.
3.	Facilitate the issuance of at least 1.5 million climate insurance policies to smallholder farmers.
4.	Generate premium volume of at least 1.5 million USD.
5.	Conduct a study to determine the level of insurance coverage that best enhances farmer resilience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,605904,,,Financial Institutions Group,,2022-08-16T04:00:00Z,2022-08-15T04:00:00Z

The project will help bring a new type of client and new target segments to FIG (MNOs and their distribution networks) that can significantly contribute to increasing SME financing.

Formalization and poverty reduction: Digital credit products (such as Tik Tak) offer an opportunity for borrowers to build a verifiable financial track record and offer an alternative to non-trackable, informal lending solutions. In Kenya, for example, studies revealed that access to formal, digital credit products resulted in a 30% reduction of credits at shopkeepers, a 15% reduction of savings groups loans and 15% decrease of lending from family and friends (CGAP, 2018). Research in Kenya indicates that access to digital credit has allowed 194,000 households to get out of extreme poverty and enhanced the living conditions of women entrepreneurs and head of households. 

COVID-19: The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the important role digital financial services can play in reducing disruptions to supply chains, maintaining economic activity, supporting social transfers and ensuring safe transactions while maintaining social distancing. This project will help OBA develop a product that can give access to credit to mobile money distributors helping them to better manage their activity and their cashflows.

The project also aims to support dissemination and raising awareness of the reforms to encourage full engagement of women in economic activities.

Following the legislative reforms, the project expects to support an increase of credit volume granted to women and an increase of equality and reduced discrimination in workplace  as measured by resolved grievance cases/complaints related to equality and non-discrimination, equal pay for work of equal value and related to issues of discrimination in workplace.

The pilot project will:

1. Support the Government of Egypt in implementing legislative reforms supporting women's participation in the economy by: 1) enhancing the existing grievance mechanism for women to file complaints related to of equal pay for work of equal value and non-discrimination in access to finance; 2) support the implementation of legislative reforms through drafting guidelines to be used by all financial institutions in the application of the principle of non-discrimination based on gender in access to finance as well as the implementation of equal pay for work of equal value,

2. Support the dissemination of the enacted reforms on equal pay for work of equal value and non-discrimination in access to finance by 1) conducting dissemination workshops with relevant stakeholders; 2) supporting the Egyptian authorities with a communication and dissemination campaign related to raising the awareness on legal reforms.

3. Measure results on the ground for the achieved reforms. The team will also conduct surveys and focus group discussions with women and other key stakeholders (employers, banks, etc.) to identify the potential impact of the legal changes on women's ability to engage in income generating activities and explore additional areas to support measuring results.",,,,,,"Fostering gender equality supports economic resilience and boosts growth. It is also critical in achieving development outcomes, as outlined in Goal 5 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Legal gender equality is associated with a range of outcomes, including higher female labor force participation, and a lower wage gap. As international indexes show, appropriate laws and policies can enhance women's economic inclusion. Beyond eliminating legal discrimination, affirmative-action policies can level the playing field for women's economic participation. Gender inequality, on the other hand, carries high costs. A recent World Bank report estimates the losses in wealth from inequality in earnings between women and men in the Middle East and North Africa at $3.1 trillion.

Legal reforms that enhance gender equality encourage more women to work. According to the Women, Business and the Law 2020 Report, female labor force participation as a percentage of the total labor force in reforming economies increased by 0.70 percentage points, while for non-reforming economies it only went up by 0.21 percentage points, a difference of 0.49 percentage points. This result signifies more women join the workforce overall in economies that are reforming towards gender equality. During the same period the labor force participation rate of women relative to men also increased by 2.05 percentage points for reforming economies, while for non-reforming economies it increased by 1.74 percentage points, a difference of 0.31 percentage points. This means that more women are likely to join the workforce relative to men in economies that are reforming towards gender equality. Legal gender equality is associated with a range of positive outcomes, including higher female labor force participation (FLFP), more women in parliament, and a lower wage gap. Advancing gender equality through regulatory and legal reform enables more women to engage in economic activities.

The Project aims to support the government of Egypt (GoE) in introducing greater equality in women's participation in the economy, by supporting the government in suggesting legislative reforms in two areas of access to finance and equal pay for work, with the overall goal of increasing women's economic participation, as well as on their dissemination, to help in encouraging the full engagement of women in the economic activities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,605118,,,Other,,2021-03-30T04:00:00Z,2021-03-01T05:00:00Z

1001,D2D Mongolia 2 Mining Data and Transparency ,Advisory Services,,Active,East Asia and the Pacific,Mongolia,,,2022-05-18T04:00:00Z,,,,"D2D Mongolia builds on IFC's experience in open data, transparency, and capacity building of infomediaries. The project will be implemented in the Umnugovi region. D2D will continue to work in implementing data disclosure best practices that can help bridge the gap between the data that is disclosed and the most pressing information needs of mining communities. To do this, the project will work  with the Ministry of Mining and Heavy Industry (MMHI) and Oyu Tolgoi to improve community access to information through the use of open data and data-driven community engagement strategies that foster fact-based dialog among stakeholders. In parallel, the program will also provide capacity building to infomediaries on digital skills, data analysis, visualization and information sharing strategies that can translate complex data into actionable and relevant insights for communities. The project will focus on ensuring that both men and women infomediaries can draw evidence-based insights that can be widely shared with communities.

Preparatory work
This includes conducting work in two areas: 1) community access to information through open data and 2) rollout of a natural resource data curriculum for infomediaries. 

Implementation of activities. 
1)	Community Access to Information through Open Data
D2D will conduct a gender disaggregated community survey in Umnugovi to identify barriers in access to information about mining revenue and social and environmental impacts. This study will help: (1) determine the key areas of interest for communities, and (2) assess the effectiveness of the existing data and information sharing mechanisms for the delivery of information to citizens.

The results of this study will inform the engagement with MMHI and Oyu Tolgoi to improve accessibility of existing data. D2D will provide technical assistance to facilitate the publishing of existing disclosures in open format, develop strategies to improve existing data platforms, help prioritize datasets that could be used to address community information demands identified, build the capacity of staff to promote data use, and jointly host multi-stakeholder events on open data and mining. 

2)	Rollout of a natural resource data curriculum for infomediaries
D2D will pilot the rollout of a natural resource data curriculum focused on digital skills, open data, analysis and visualization for infomediaries. To maximize skill transfer in the Umnogovi region, the pilot will target two types of infomediaries: those interested in becoming trainers, through a 'train the trainers' format, and local stakeholders (local government representatives, community leaders, industry relationship managers, civil society organizations, and media) with limited capacity to conduct analysis for information sharing. All participants will complete the 5-module curriculum.  

Through these two components, D2D will contribute to the generation of evidence-based knowledge about mining, which in turn will enable a more equitable discussion about mining operations and investments among communities, national and subnational governments, and industry.
",,,,,,"The From Disclosure to Development Program (D2D), in partnership with the BHP Foundation, aims to improve community understanding of benefits, risks and impact of mining operations in the Umnugovi region through effective use of data and information. The project is expected to:

1)	improve disclosure practices of mining-related information by government and companies
2)	build capacity of infomediaries in digital skills, data analysis, and visualization, and
3)	promote the dissemination of evidence-based mining media reporting by infomediaries in the Umnugovi province

The project consists of two components: 1. Advisory work to upgrade quality assurance in healthcare facilities; 2. Enhancing knowledge base and awareness on healthcare quality issues.

Component 1.

The project uses tools of varying level of depth and interaction in its engagements with clients: (i) rapid quality assessment, (ii) full quality assessment, (iii) hospital design review and (iv) implementation support. 

Rapid Quality Assessments evaluate the performance of a medical facility across 25-30 performance indicators that allow the facility to identify major gaps in safety practices. 

Full Quality Assessments are used to diagnose the quality of facilities' infrastructure, standards, and procedures. Such assessments analyze good practices in place, pinpoint key shortcomings and describe priority remedial actions across 8 key areas, 34 standards and 158 measurable elements. Specialized tools are applied for assessments of laboratories and imaging facilities. 

Hospital Layout Design Reviews aim to identify potential infrastructure challenges and provide recommendations on how to prevent/address the challenges in the most cost-effective manner. 

Implementation support is provided to client medical facilities that wish to implement a healthcare quality improvement program with support from IFC (trainings and workshops on areas for improvement, periodical consulting on implementation of changes over a fixed period of time (6-12 months), repeat assessments and reviews of refurbishment/expansion plans).

For Component 1, the project will disclose the following results: 
# of entities receiving advisory services 
# of entities that implemented recommended changes

Component 2. 

The focus of Component 2 is on increasing awareness of the healthcare quality issues in select target countries. The project organizes practical workshops and sets local communities of practice on healthcare quality. Through this work, a broader range of market participants can receive information on how to address the biggest gaps in healthcare quality.

The project also provides staff training to help drive quality improvement in medical facilities in SSA. Committed senior leadership and well-trained quality managers are key success factors to enable change in operations that will last.

For Component 1, the project will disclose the following results:
# of workshops, training events, conferences, etc. 
# of participants in workshops, training events, conferences, etc.
# of participants of events providing feedback on satisfaction
# of participants reporting satisfied or very satisfied with workshops, training events, conferences, etc.
# of reports completed

Environmental and Social (E&S) Risks: Project clients may not be compliant with IFC Performance Standards. As part of its Due Diligence process, IFC is in the process of reviewing project risks, including E&S risks, and assessing the consistency of its advice with IFCs Performance Standards. Based on sector and context specific risks, the project has the potential for E&S risks and/or impacts in relation to client incompliance with IFC Performance Standards where related to labor and working conditions, pollution, community health and safety. Health quality assessments may also flag certain E&S risks (i.e., handling medical waste). Therefore, E&S risk and issues contemplated by IFCs Performance Standards may be present. To mitigate this risk, IFC's advice will be provided in a manner consistent with IFCs Performance Standards as defined in IFCs Policy on Environmental and Social Sustainability. Where relevant, IFC will assist the client in defining measures to identify and manage E&S risks and impacts of the business activities supported by the project.",,,,,,"In many Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, the quality of care is often relatively low with deficiencies found in infrastructure, clinical competence, and practice. Low-quality health care in SSA causes an almost equal number of preventable deaths each year as the lack of access to healthcare, according to Lancet Global Health Commission on High Quality Health Systems. 

In many instances, the quality of care can be improved at a relatively low cost through the implementation of patient safety requirements and other standards, however many medical facilities often lack knowledge and capacity to establish quality structures and implement quality assurance. The situation becomes even more difficult in low-income and low resource settings. 

In this project, IFC combines firm-level work (healthcare quality assessments of selected healthcare facilities) with targeted sector-level work in several countries, raising awareness about quality and patient safety amongst health care providers more systematically, and building the capacity of regional quality managers and senior leadership. 

The project expects to achieve the following impact through improvements in quality assurance processes and practices that are put in place by client medical facilities in SSA: increased number of SSA patients that receive access to safer and better-quality healthcare, additional financing for SSA medical facilities that was facilitated by project activities.

The project will disclose the following impact indicators:
Value of financing facilitated (US$)
Value of IFC financing facilitated (US$)
Number of people receiving access to improved services (real/non-financial sectors)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,606653,,,"Manufacturing, Agribusiness & Services",,2022-02-15T05:00:00Z,2022-01-01T05:00:00Z

The project will also support activities that promote optimal usage of credit infrastructure, catalyze financing to MSMEs and crowd in additional private sector investment. This program aims to support and leverage the reach of regional central authorities such as BCEAO (West African States Central Bank), BEAC (Central African States Central Bank) and the OHADA Permanent Secretariat, as well as similar activities being implemented under different programs within OHADA. 

In line with the IFC SME Finance long-term business plan on leveraging technology and innovative models to deliver greater scale and impact, the project will leverage on partnerships with industry players to gain an understanding of the market characteristics to develop and pilot innovative products aimed at expanding access to credit by MSMEs.
The project scope will cover four OHADA countries - Burkina Faso (BF), Cote d'Ivoire (CdI), DRC and Gabon - but certain reforms/activities will impact on the rest of the countries across common markets. Upon successful completion of this phase I project, a follow on program will be considered as appropriate. The choice of countries was made in agreement with the OHADA Secretariat, based on a combination of criteria including the need to have a regional balance between West and Central Africa, as well as client commitment/willingness to adopt reforms. 

Component I: Enhancing the Credit Reporting Environment 

The objective of this component is to enhance the credit reporting environment in the region through the review of legal frameworks, modernizing the credit information sharing systems and the development and deployment of value-added services. This component is aimed at promoting access to credit by MSMEs with thin or no credit files. This component will support policy and infrastructure development work in CEMAC and DRC, while the activities in UEMOA will support the implementation of value-added services. 

1.1	Enhancing policy and regulatory framework

1.2	Support the establishment of credit reporting system

1.3	Expand information sharing through onboarding of non-bank financial institutions 

Component II: Enhancing Regulatory and Institutional Frameworks for Movable Asset Lending

The objective is to promote movable asset-based lending by enhancing the effectiveness of the movable asset financing system established in CdI and Gabon under previous IC projects and support the establishment and sustained operation of a movable asset collateral registry in BF and DRC. It will also support market creation activities to boost access to credit by MSMEs that do not have real estate/immovable assets, often preferred by FIs as security for loans and create upstream investment opportunities for IFC.

2.1 Promote the Adoption of Regulatory and Supervisory Frameworks that will facilitate Asset-Based Lending

2.2 Operationalization and digitalization of the commercial and collateral registry (RCCM)

Component III: NPL Management and COVID Response 

The objective of this component is to assist the region in dealing with a potential surge in NPLs due to the COVID pandemic. Although an effective NPL strategy involves several responses at a prudential, regulatory and legislative level, strengthening the insolvency framework and distressed asset market will assist the region in resolving potential NPLs in a manner that aims to maximize creditor recovery.

3.1	Support the implementation of NPL out-of-court workout arrangements

3.2	Support the development and deployment of 'COVID 19 Business Rating/Index for firms'

3.3	Support the establishment and strengthening of SME Rating",,,,,,"Alignment to AIMM objectives:  
Inclusiveness: The efficient functioning of the collateral registry and credit information sharing (including onboarding of NBFIs) is expected to increase access to credit for MSMEs, especially those operating in informal markets and ultimately increase the coverage of the credit reporting system. An estimated 0.6 million MSMEs in OHADA are credit constrained due to lack of credit history and collateral. These interventions will also assist in reducing the financing gap for women and youth owned enterprises. The project will also contribute to improving the region's business climate thus contribute to increases in investments. According to the 2017 World Bank Enterprise Survey, nearly 29 percent of firms in Burkina Faso, 37 percent of firms in DRC, 21.3 percent in Cote d'Ivoire, and 29 percent in Gabon, did not apply for a loan due to various constraints. 75 percent of firms in Burkina Faso identify access to finance as a major constraint to doing business, while only 25.6 percent of firms use banks to finance investments. The percentages are equally telling in DRC, 39.1/7.1 percent (2009), Cote d'Ivoire, 45 /30 percent (SME Finance Forum 2017) and Gabon, 30.4/6.3 percent (2013).
Furthermore, a significant proportion (85.7 percent in Cote d'Ivoire and 91.7 percent in Burkina Faso) of loans require collateral that is usually valued at between 152 to 233 percent of the total loan amount (175.5 percent in Burkina Faso, 152.1 percent in DRC, 157 percent in Cote d'Ivoire and unknown in Gabon). The global and regional average is 77.8 percent and 84.3 percent respectively. Lack of appropriate collateral (real estate or land) is among the most widely cited obstacles encountered by MSMEs when seeking finance from Banks. The situation is exacerbated as about 85  90% of microenterprises (operating largely informally and on a cash basis) and small business owners have little to no credit profiles, hampering their ability to access credit from FIs. Poor accounting systems to record transactions and generate credible financial statements adds to the bulk of transactions going unrecorded. Further, the new collateral instruments in the Uniform Act (UA) on Secured Transactions are not reflected in the Prudential Rules applicable to West Africa's banking sector. Banks do not use the new collateral.
Competitiveness  The project will foster increased competitiveness in the MSME financing market through initiatives that promote competition, e.g. implementation of regulations related to the functioning of the secured transaction laws, movable collateral registry, and credit bureau. This will lead to a shift in the overall market as more firms use movable assets-based lending, the number of credit enquiries in the credit bureau rises, and lending to MSME rises. Robust credit reporting systems will enhance competition in the credit markets by providing uniform access to information to all credit providers and providing an opportunity for new entrants like digital lenders the tools to be able to make creditworthiness assessment. The capacity building among lenders on how to develop and roll out asset-based lending products would foster competitiveness in the credit market in the target countries with knock on effect all through OHADA.

Funding Gebeya's incubator will also catalyze the emergence of more female digital entrepreneurs who will now have access to funding and resources necessary to develop and scale their businesses through this program.

Currently, many universities in African countries do not offer comprehensive and relevant training in programming and other software development courses. In addition, the job market has become  increasingly competitive; according to the International Labor Organisation (ILO) the youth unemployment rate hovers around 12% in SSA. While this is slightly lower than the global youth unemployment rate of 12.4%, the African region has the world's highest rate of working poor people who are employed but earning less than US$2 a day. Despite being Africa's most educated generation to emerge from schools and universities, a young person from Africa is twice as likely to be unemployed when he/she becomes an adult, according to the ILO.

The exclusion of women from the labor force further perpetuates generational cycles of poverty. Women account for approximately 50% of Africa's population but only contribute 39% of the Continent's GDP due to limited employment opportunities and lack of representation at higher levels in the organization where employment decisions are often made

The Digital Gender-Ethiopia project will increase the number of female software developers with core technical and job readiness skills who can then go on to establish digital result in the training of at least 250 female software developers. Due to Gebeya's track record in successfully placing graduates of its programs, the Digital Gender-Ethiopia program will result in creation of employment and entrepreneurship opportunities for Ethiopia's growing base of software developers.

Market creation enabled by the project:
The project will develop the entrepreneurship/tech ecosystem, particularly with respect to women entrepreneurs through two distinct channels: capacity building and a demonstration effect. 
Women entrepreneurs face critical gaps due to their lack of access to appropriate networks and know-how that could make them more competitive in securing financing for their businesses. The project increases their capacity by giving women access to relevant training and knowledge which will build critical skills that will benefit them beyond the direct project impacts.  
Secondly, Gebeya's incubator will provide seed funding to at least 20 female digital entrepreneurs graduating from its training programs thereby increasing the representation of women in tech startups in Africa. This is expected to have a ripple effect in bringing on board more women into the ecosystem and resulting in more employment opportunities for women in Ethiopia. As more women entrepreneurs / women led enterprises succeed and start to play a critical role in the broader ecosystem, the number of women pursuing entrepreneurship ventures will increase through a demonstration effect. In addition, IFC's support will help change risk perceptions and, if successful, send a signal to the market which could catalyze more private capital into women enterprises, alleviating some of the gender inequities in access to financing.

As a result of the above, the project is expected to not only increase the inclusiveness of the market,  but also increase its overall competitiveness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,603451,,,Other,,2019-02-26T05:00:00Z,2019-03-01T05:00:00Z

Such bottlenecks include the sector need for clear and unambiguous laws, policies and regulations on leasing to help mitigate sector risks by establishing leasing laws and/or prudential requirements for the leasing business (i.e., those related to asset repossession, VAT, minimum regulations and entry requirements, liquidity requirements, reporting and public disclosure requirements, etc.), as well as the lack of up-to-date market skills and expertise.

Rapid changes in technology have shifted the focus of a well-educated worker, in the 21st century, from the qualifications needed for doing a lifetime' job to the skills needed to do specific tasks in jobs that are constantly changing. This is especially relevant for the billion young women and men entering the workforce over the next decade. There are currently 1.8 billion young people ages 15-29 in the world which is about 16% of the global population, making this the largest youth generation in history. The imbalance between education and training young people are receiving and the jobs available have a disproportionately significant impact on today's youth employment crisis. In much of the world, the education system is failing to equip the future generation of workers with the knowledge and skills they need to be productive members of society. Systemic and fundamental changes in education and training, along with a renewed skills agenda with innovative approaches to supporting employability, are needed to successfully address the youth employment challenge.

IFC is the largest multilateral investor in private education in emerging markets and has invested nearly US$2 billion in this sector globally since 2000. IFC has now developed an advisory offer to complement its investment activity in education. IFC's Employability Tool is an innovative appraisal instrument which assesses tertiary education providers, including vocational training institutions, on delivery of employability outcomes in a systematic manner. The assessment provides a 360 degree view of an institution's approach to student employability, including employability strategy and governance, the relevance of teaching and learning to labor market developments, approaches to career services and alumni management, as well as incorporation of employer engagement and information technology.

The Objective of the Employability Measurement Project is to improve the processes and operations in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) (TVET, colleges, and universities) and thus provide improved employability services to students. The Project aims to improve the employability outcomes of tertiary level education institutions through data driven assessments, and improvements rooted in institutional capacity building by reorienting processes, operations, and systems to incorporate employability into instruction and services.

The unemployment rate in South Africa is 28%, and 56% is attributed to youth unemployment, making them the most vulnerable in the South African labor market. Enhancing students' employability outcomes in South Africa by producing graduates with the right skill set who are equipped to meet the demands of the labor market is crucial for promoting economic and social development. Supporting the Higher Education Institutions on the journey to deliver better employability outcomes will significantly impact the quality of graduates in the long term and support the business case for private sector provision for tertiary education services in South Africa.

1153,Strengthening  Tourism Sector Competitiveness in Peru,Advisory Services,,Active,Latin America and the Caribbean,Peru,,,2021-03-29T04:00:00Z,,,,"Peru has strong potential to leverage tourism as a source of regional growth and economic diversification. The travel and tourism industries are the fourth largest employer in the country (1.3 million job posts or 7.7%) after agriculture, retail and education, and a substantial employer of both women and youth. Tourism is the third-most important source of revenue within the national economy, generating US$4,895 million (8.8% of total exports) according to ComexPeru, with the potential to further extend its reach into secondary cities and more diverse geographic regions within the country. International arrivals have reached 4.4 million visitors in 2018 and are expected to continue growing, according to MINCETUR. This shows the urgency of achieving a better coordination between all levels of government to manage such growth in the sector.  

At the operational level,  poor coordination and excessive red  tape is stalling the investments needed for the sector to grow, formalize, and move into new areas. These delays potentially represent lost revenues, fewer salaries, lower  taxes, and diminish both direct and indirect channel growth (food & beverage and other services). To use lodging as an example, the number of hotels and other accommodation providers is one of the highest in the region on a per capita basis. However, about half  of all firms in the tourism sector are formally registered due to the difficulties of registering. The consequence for the sector and its reputation is clear: the quality of products and services across the middle and lower ends of the sector is low and will constrain growth prospects and economic inclusion. 

Three destinations are particularly challenged by a combination of high growth and poor coordination: Chachapoyas, Arequipa and Piura. This project will address some of the most critical cross-cutting issues holding Peru's tourism sector back at a destination level. These include business environment issues, accommodation regulation, investment promotion, data and statistics, and adventure tourism standards. 

At the same time, there are multiple coordination failures among national-level entities, between national and regional/municipal entities, and between the public and private sectors at all levels. These were highlighted in a 2013 WEF Insight Report on tourism which pointed to the need for better coordination between the public and private sectors on a range of issues from pricing to strategy implementation.",,,,,,"The project aims to strengthen institutional capacity to attract and retain sustainable and inclusive tourism sector investment in target destinations. This will be achieved by regulatory improvement, building institutional framework for investment promotion and supporting development of strong data collection and use on behalf of the Peruvian Government in order to guide strategy moving forward. The intervention is expected to generate jobs directly and indirectly, and generate 20m in investment, plus at least 2 leads on potential infrastructure projects.

The first pillar is the investment lifecycle, which sees FDI as a dynamic relationship with the host economy, and not merely as a one-time transaction. This view corresponds to an investment policy and promotion framework capable of addressing issues along various stages of the relationship between foreign investors and the host economy, including FDI attraction, entry and establishment, expansion, and linkages with the domestic economy. The second pillar is the investment typology, which sees FDI as a heterogenous phenomenon, which can be broadly categorized along four types (natural resource-seeking, efficiency-seeking, domestic market-seeking and strategic asset-seeking).",,,,,,"The Objective of Peru Investment Policy and Promotion project is to assist the National Government, through its implementing agency PROMPERU, in creating and strengthening the institutional framework by means of creating a Direction of Foreign Investments which will identify private investment barriers and better understanding the role of existing investment incentives in attracting and retaining foreign investors. The assistance on this area, in close coordination with existing IFC projects, will enable private investment growth in new markets and sectors, diversifying FDI inflows away from traditional sectors/locations and generating an overall increase in investments materializing in Peru.

The project will work with all relevant stakeholders comprising the entities involved in issuing the construction permit, in addition to other indirectly involved entities. The project will consist of three main components:

1-	Legal and Regulatory Reforms
The project will support legal reforms needed to streamline the regulatory framework and institutional setup for building controlin line with international good practices and taking into consideration the local context. This will entail streamlining the roles of GAM and relevant stakeholders and providing the end-to-end process for granting building and occupancy permits for all building types. It will also introduce risk-based approaches in building control, ensure proper governance and transparency of the process, and ensure clarity and availability of all information on the permitting process. 

2-	Institutional and Operational Improvements
The project will support introducing and implementing an improved institutional framework for building control ensures more predictability in the issuance of building and occupancy permits. It will also support the design and application of risk-based approaches in order to ensure that the level of controls is proportional to the level of risk of each risk class. 

Additionally, the project will support improving operational efficiency by streamlining building control activities at GAM to minimize the number of steps and time needed to issue the permit, and setting time limits for granting approvals that are mutually agreed and enforced by the involved stakeholders. Information on procedural, legal, and technical requirements will be published in an easily accessible manner.

3-	ICT Solutions 
The project will also be introducing a virtual one-stop-shop for construction permitting, which will integrate all referral agencies in one platform and provide end users with a single online window for all construction related procedures. The aim is to ensure that applicants will not have to physically visit each applicable law agency separately to obtain permits, save for exceptional cases. 
",,,,,,"The foreseen impact of the project is to improve the investment climate and minimize the burden on the private sector in relation to the construction permitting process by strengthening accountability, enhancing transparency, improving efficiency of different relevant entities, lowering compliance costs and improving predictability of the building control system. This will be achieved through collaboration between all involved entities and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to improve the legal and regulatory framework for building control and encourage the implementation of more efficient practices and ICT solutions at the local authority level.

IFC will provide technical assistance to GoJ in improving regulatory requirements and procedures for business registration and licensing, which will be achieved by supporting legal and institutional reforms for business registration and selected business licenses and implementing an integrated regulatory delivery system. 

This system will entail an integrated business registry with a streamlined and transparent business registration process. The integrated business registry will facilitate further reforms in business licensing and other regulatory procedures as it will provide the platform for integrating and combining regulatory requirements and procedures through the same point of single contact, which would help achieve major cuts in regulatory procedures. The initial costs for establishing the integrated registry and interoperability framework will be offset by the ability to re-use the same platform to streamline and automate as many licensing, permitting, and other regulatory procedures at minimal costs. 

This project is designed to focus on reforming business registration at the foundation phase, as well as support streamlining and automation of up to five licenses (using the same integrated platform) which will be selected based on readiness and in agreement with GoJ priorities, taking into account GoJ's Licensing Reform Policy Paper and its implementation progress. 

The main client for this project is the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Supply (MoITS) which oversees the Investor Journey program in Jordan. The main stakeholders include the Commercial Registry Department at MoITS and the Companies Control Department, which are the entities responsible for registering sole-proprietors and companies, respectively. The project will also be coordinating with all relevant stakeholders involved in the business registration process, as well as the stakeholders involved in the pilot licenses. During the first year of the project, two pilot licenses have been identified, namely the licensing of private schools and KGs, and licensing of nurseries providing childcare.
The project will be designating a single business registration authority for all types of business using an integrated and interoperable business registry as the official repository of data for all businesses in Jordan. This will involve a complete transition of businesses into the new integrated registry and promote the Companies Control Department as the single business registration authority for Jordan.
",,,,,,"The foreseen impact of the project is to create an enabling regulatory environment for investments and business, by improving the predictability and reducing compliance costs and time in business registration and licensing. The project will also enable the Government of Jordan set a foundation for integrated regulatory delivery based on an accurate and updated business registry and other data. A complete, transparent and accurate data business is an important building block of a good business environment, because:

	It gives the government the tools to produce business statistics and design policies, as well as to implement regulatory policy;
	It gives market participants the information they need to value their risks in investing and trading or access a market;
	It is linked to other important areas such as access to finance, financial inclusion, capital markets, collateral registries; and
	It is the foundation for integrated service delivery in government to business services.

The results will be measured by: 

- Time required to register and license a business.
- Procedures required to register and license a business.
- Compliance cost savings for the private sector as a result of improving business registration and licensing.

Approximately 86% of the agriculture GDP comes from food crops coming almost exclusively from small scale farmers. Despite the good progress in agriculture production, there are still gaps along the supply chain creating a disconnect between production and the industry which has growing demand for quality raw material. This is particularly an issue in the maintenance of quality and in the prevention of aflatoxin in maize due to the wet conditions of harvest in Rwanda.

Significant efforts have been made by other donors (including WFP, USAID,CDI,CHAI) to train farmers on better post-harvest practices, yet the most significant aflatoxin risks in the supply chain occur in Rwanda at the aggregation stage. To optimize throughput of stock and reduce aflatoxin risk, better knowledge and upgrades are needed throughout the supply chain from farm to coops, traders and stock keepers. 
In 2015, the government of Rwanda entered a $66 million JV with Royal DSM (NL) as majority shareholder to form AIFL along with IFCs individual investment of $26 million, a food processing plant manufacturing fortified food for young children and mothers.
The Rwanda Grain Markets Advisory project will take a demand-driven and market-led approach to most of the activities and provide technical assistance to aggregators, traders, off-takers, and a few select coops.  
The IBRD's Rwanda Agriculture team and IFC have identified activities that will allow for complementarity and an appreciation of IFC's market-led approach by graduating some cooperatives to a more commercial model and supporting market linkages. The project is planning close collaboration with IBRD's SAIP project in concrete areas: i) facilitating market linkages for SAIP-supported cooperatives, ii) sharing information on cooperatives to ensure that equipment that will be provided under the SAIP matching grant program will go to the candidates with the most sustainable business plans in place, including rural traders, iii) building on the current IFC AIFL Rwanda project (600717) to continue increasing bankability for the cooperatives that went through the Scope Insight program, approaching financial institutions together aligning efforts to increase access to finance for cooperatives, iv) leveraging the ICT solutions that will be developed by SAIP with project activities to improve efficiencies and market access,  v) Sharing of information and embarking on joint missions and a one-WBG team approach.

A renewed skills agenda is particularly relevant as Ghana's population continues to expand rapidly from 27.5 million in 2015 to more than 50 million by 2050, with more than 57% of the population under the age of 25 and the working-age population at 75.1%. Leveraging this demographic dividend to build a skilled workforce will be critical for realizing Ghana's development potential. Improving the employability of Ghanaians and attaining greater competitiveness in the labor and markets will produce greater participation of young women and men in the economy.

IFC is the largest multilateral investor in private education in emerging markets and has invested nearly US$2 billion in this sector globally since 2000. IFC has now developed an advisory offer to complement its investment activity in education. IFC's Employability Tool is an innovative appraisal instrument which assesses tertiary education providers, including vocational training institutions, on delivery of employability outcomes in a systematic manner. The assessment provides a 360 degree view of an institution's approach to student employability, including employability strategy and governance, the relevance of teaching and learning to labor market developments, approaches to career services and alumni management, as well as incorporation of employer engagement and information technology.

The Objective of the Skills in Ghana Project is to improve employability-related processes and operations in tertiary level education institutions (TVET, colleges, and universities) in Ghana and thus help institutions to provide improved employability services to students. The Project is implemented in partnership with the National Council for Tertiary Education (NCTE), the regulator, and  it takes a programmatic sector level approach by engaging both public and private institutions to develop a sector level 'language' and data-driven understanding of employability.

As a follow up to the assessment, institutions will be able to request advisory services to implement recommended changes and improvements.

The assessment drives data-driven decision making at institutions, complemented with institutional capacity building designed to reorient processes, operations, and systems to incorporate employability into instruction and services. The project will also seek to create knowledge and raise awareness on good practice regarding employability and digital skills, as analysis derived from the Employability Tool assessments can be aggregated to provide a valuable sector-wide snap shot of the strength of the overall employability proposition in Ghana.

1221,Water Innovation Platform Africa,Advisory Services,,Completed,Africa,Cote D'Ivoire,,,2020-10-06T04:00:00Z,,,,"Enormous geographic disparities in basic water supply and sanitation leave many populations underserved. Many African water utilities are not creditworthy. So despite the need, private investors struggle to finance large projects that could make a significant impact. New technologies and practices to improve operations, service and efficiency, are constantly being brought to market. However, African utilities are chronically underfunded and often lack the internal capacity to assess these new offers. 

IFC, in collaboration with the African Water Association (AfWA), set up a water innovation platform for Africa (WIPA). Through this approach, experts consult with senior staff at the utilities to identify the issues which would benefit from a technical solution. They collaboratively sort through both proven and innovative technologies which could address the problem. The companies, utilities, and development partners then seek to pilot and transfer the technologies to the utilities. This approach deploys technologies to enhance and upgrade the existing asset base. This thus begins the process of addressing core issues such as non-revenue water, and can lead to subsequent investment for large greenfield investments. 

In 2016, IFC helped set up the first phase of the innovation platform, called WIPA 1, which worked with technical leads at African water utilities to understand their challenges, and then helped them to assess and select proven technologies that best addressed their needs. This second phase of the platform - WIPA 2 - will focus on expansion of the platform by identifying and selecting more technologies, that would be piloted by the utilities. 
",,,,,,"The aim of the Water Innovation Platform for Africa (WIPA 2) is to bring robust, new (to Africa) technologies to African water utilities to make them more efficient and effective in the services they provide, as well as more resilient to shocks. The key element of this approach is bringing water utilities together in a supportive forum (at the WIPA meetings) to review pre-screened technology solutions and share experiences. Success of the program will be measured by the number of technologies screened and presented at the WIPA meetings, and the number of trials implemented by African water utilities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,602917,,,Infrastructure,,2019-08-13T04:00:00Z,2019-07-19T04:00:00Z

1.	Onerous Business Environment: Business environment in Afghanistan is burdensome resulting in daunting challenges faced by the Private Sector. Business environment is negatively affected by political instability, corruption, limited access to land, electricity, finance and lack of trust between government and the Private Sector. Complex government regulations, tax rates and tax administration are also major constraints on business activities. 

2.	Low investment and capital flight: Domestic and Foreign Investment are affected by unfavorable investment, regulatory and political conditions in the country. Attraction of new investment in a fragile country like Afghanistan can be very challenging, but it is necessary to retain existing investments. However, Afghanistan lacks a clear retention strategy that makes it difficult to retain current investments and results in capital flight.

3.	Legal barriers on economic participation of women: Conducting business in Afghanistan is particularly difficult for women. The share of women among business owners in Afghanistan is the lowest in the world. There is lack of evidence-based research whether legal text limits women's equal access to entrepreneurship opportunities or if legislative text translates into gender biased implementation.

4.	Low institutional capacity: Institutional capacity in Afghanistan is a key challenge that results in bureaucracy, a complex regulatory framework, and widespread corruption.

The overall objective of the project is to catalyze doing business reforms in Afghanistan. Project specific objectives are:

1.	Streamline the legal and regulatory framework for doing business in select Doing Business Indicators. These will likely be: Dealing with Construction permits, Trading Across Border, Paying Taxes, Getting Electricity and Getting Credit. 

2.	Strengthen inter-agency coordination mechanisms on investment climate reforms and establish effective public-private dialogue mechanisms    

The implementation of the project started in January 2018. Since then, the project achieved significant milestones that contributed in improvement of business climate in Afghanistan:

I.	Drafted Doing Business Reform Memorandum for 10 Doing Business Indicators. It provides short, medium and long-term recommendations for GoIRA. The recommendations of the Memo have been imbedded in the 5-year national priority program on private sector development in Afghanistan as a roadmap to improve investment climate.

II.	The project supported Government of Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GoIRA) in drafting a 5-year National Priority Program and short-term action plans for Private Sector Development in the country. 

III.	The project helped the GoIRA in implementation of some of the recommendations under the DB reform memo. the project team reviewed and provided inputs in the revision of Limited Liability Company and new Insolvency laws.  As a result of the recommendations, the country moved up in the ranking of countries in the Doing Business report from 183 in 2018 to 167 in 2019. 

IV.	To strengthen coordination efforts, the project is providing technical support to Executive Committee on Private Sector development (PriSEC) to undertake coordination and monitor progress of reforms' implementation. PriSEC is a high-level platform that coordinates and monitors reforms for private sector development.


",,,,,,"The overall objective of the project is to catalyze doing business reforms in Afghanistan, with emphasis on areas with the greatest potential to contribute to the improvement of investment climate and investment facilitation. This will be achieved through strategic support from the Doing Business reform team to capacitate GoIRA as reform institution, improvements in interagency coordination and public-private dialogue.

The project aims to achieve the following specific objectives by its completion:

1.	Streamline the legal and regulatory framework for doing business in select Doing Business Indicators. These will likely be: Dealing with Construction permits, Trading Across Border, Paying Taxes, Getting Electricity and Getting Credit. 

2.	Strengthen inter-agency coordination mechanisms on investment climate reforms and establish effective public-private dialogue mechanisms",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,602848,,,Other,,2018-04-04T04:00:00Z,2018-01-01T05:00:00Z

The project aims to enhance overall AMRU supply chain performance and increase revenues for firm and smallholder farmers through improving productivity and efficiency through training and adoption of new practices, technologies and inputs.

Despite the undisputed development taken place over the past years, the Cambodia rice sector still faces some key challenges including insufficient and inadequate supply from farmers, poor process quality, and poor market access. At farm level, challenges lie with still suboptimal farming practices, limited application of respective technologies, relevant know-how, insufficient quantities of improved seed, other quality inputs, and access to finance. Yield is lowest among rice production countries in the Mekong (2.8MT/ha vs 4.5 in Vietnam and 3.2 in Thailand). A lack of strong organizational structures slows productivity gain: Agriculture Cooperatives (AC) can assist their members to obtain quality inputs at more economical condition and facilitate access to finance. In addition, women farmers play important roles in both rice production and post-harvest activities, particularly in managing household incomes and expenditures. However, women farmers have limited knowledge on financial literacy and business management skills, preventing them from making the productive decision and participation in AC leadership roles.  

At mill level, remaining inefficiencies in processing, storage capacity, control over the supply chain and weak or lack of extension services, paired with limited marketing knowledge, result in low value addition and limited growth opportunities. Furthermore, poor market access due to lack of knowledge on potential markets, and product and market diversification limits Cambodia rice sector to fully realize its potential growth.    

In addition, the rice sector's fast devolvement and continued growth come at a price to the environment and cause a variety of challenges on farm, mill and firm levels. To sustain production without depleting & destroying essential natural resources, environmentally-smart production processes are needed. Rice milling must become more cost efficient to gain economic competitiveness. To supply large retailers in high value markets, exporters must improve corporate governance and adopt Environment, Health and Sustainability Management Systems (EHS MS). Meeting such buyers' audit requirements is fundamental and include various product and production quality certification.

Component 1: Advisory work to upgrade quality assurance in healthcare facilities. The project will work with healthcare facilities to increase the quality of care. The team will apply advisory offerings with varying level of depth and interaction with clients. We expect that the three major demanded offerings are (i) rapid quality assessment, (ii) full quality assessment, and (iii) implementation support. 

Component 2: Enhancing awareness of healthcare quality and patient safety issues by medical facilities and capacity to advise healthcare facilities on such issues across the healthcare sector in Egypt by: (a) delivering of awareness events and (b) providing training to local healthcare quality service providers to develop a cadre of experts who can advise healthcare facilities in the future.

IFC's healthcare quality assessments and follow up quality improvement programs will provide clients with clear understanding of the deficiencies in quality and action plans to implement improvements. A knowledge base on health quality assurance will be made available to clinics, hospitals and diagnostic centers. The service will become more accessible to clients in Egypt through development of qualified consultants who can deliver assessments and thus facilitate tangible improvements in processes and quality of care. The project will promote and support good practice that directly contributes to the continued development of health services in Egypt, as health care providers with better quality assurance practices are more likely to attract investment. With improvements in quality assurance processes and practices implemented by medical facilities in the region, more patients in Egypt will receive access to safe and quality health care.",,,,,,"Lack of quality assurance and patient safety in Egypt is a major concern. Even basic safety practices are still not universally implemented. According to a 2018 analysis published by Lancet *, poor quality of care in Egypt results in more preventable deaths (~63k/year) than deaths due to lack of access to healthcare services (~31k/year). Developmental assistance in health area is often targeted towards communicable diseases and maternal and child health. While better quality assurance standards can directly contribute to eliminating those issues, healthcare providers in Egypt are rarely aware how to enhance quality assurance and entailed benefits for safety of its patients. Registration and Accreditation requirements are introduced, but medical facilities lack clarity of the standards, the compliance criteria and the assessment methodology.   

The overall goal of the IFC Egypt Quality Advisory Program is to increase access to safe and quality healthcare by improving the quality assurance processes and practices by healthcare service providers in Egypt. IFC will also enhance awareness and knowledge of quality assurance processes by healthcare providers and other stakeholders. This will contribute among other factors to increased investment in healthcare facilities as healthcare providers with better quality assurance practices can become more attractive investment targets for IFC and other financiers. The program is expected to achieve the following impact targets within 2 years after project completion: 
- 210,000 people receiving access to improved healthcare services from program clients.  
- At least US$50 million financing from all financiers facilitated by project activities.

The project will have two components:  Trade Policy Reform and Enhanced Trade Facilitation.
Component 1:  Trade Policy Reform
1. Tariff Rationalization: Tariff serves the dual purpose of revenue and protection. In an era of progressive trade liberalization, finding that balance is a challenge since all direct and indirect taxes are expected to be designed as such that it ensures maximum revenue mobilization and keeps the business incentive high. To this end, the project will support NBR to develop and implement sector-based roadmap/ timetable for tariff rationalization. 
2. Expansion of the Bonded Warehouse Facility to non-RMG exporting sectors: Bangladesh's customs bonded warehouse regime permits licensed manufacturers to import duty-free parts and materials required for their export production purposes. The project will support NBR to bring necessary regulatory and procedural changes and capacity to offer equitable bonded warehouse access to selected non-RMG priority sectors.  
Component 2: Enhanced Trade Facilitation
1. Implementation support for the New Customs Act: NBR is currently in the process of revising Customs Act 1969 in light of the Revised Kyoto Convention (RKC). The project will support NBR in drafting selected set of rules and regulations, e.g. risk management, valuation etc. The project will conduct awareness program on the new Act and regulations amongst the traders.
2. Policy and operational strategies for National Single Window for Trade:  As Bangladesh aims to have a trade single window, the project will support NBR to secure consensus amongst the key stakeholders, it will help NBR to have a blue-print document covering the key aspects of the single window implementation and to draft the NSW Law, which will be necessary for effective implementation and sustainability of the system.
3. Risk based Customs Control: Customs administrations are increasingly adopting risk management techniques to determine where the greatest areas of exposure to risk exist and how to effectively allocate scarce resources to manage these risks. The project will work closely with the NBR to prepare necessary strategic document for establishment of a dedicated Risk Management Directorate with its own organogram and HR policies, develop the specifications for the RM software along with capacity building of key risk management officials and develop the SRO and SOP on risk-based customs control. 
4. Implementation support for TRS-based reforms:  The project will support NBR to develop a prioritization document which identifies and highlights the reforms and recommendations to reduce time and cost to trade at the four Customs Houses as per TRS. The project will also assist NBR to develop the SOP for System-based TRS for continuous improvement at Customs.
5. WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement Implementation Support: The WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement suggests measures that require compliance by all border clearance agencies and necessary policy reform reflecting on their commitment and practice. Therefore, the project will support the Ministry of Commerce, the ministry responsible for trade, to develop a WTO TFA Implementation Action Plan with clear roles and responsibilities identified for all key implementation agencies. The project will also provide support to implement selected measures to reduce time and cost of trading and to NBR to develop a Customs Modernization Strategic Action Plan and an HR strategy to support the modernization initiatives to align with the WTO TFA.",,,,,,The overall objective of the project is to reduce the time and cost to trade and reduce anti-export bias in trade policy to ensure it supports export growth and diversification.

The Project will include two components:  
1.	Strengthen investors protection mechanism and increase transparency by closing the regulatory implementation gap;
2.	Develop competitive tourism value chain to increase private investments. 

In first component, the work will focus on improving investor retention and protection through strengthening the institutional set up and improve procedures for resolving investors grievances by developing recommendations on relevant changes into existing laws, regulations and procedures. The Project will also conduct a comprehensive legal analysis of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and Treaties with Investment Provisions (TIPs) negotiated by the Kyrgyz Republic and compare them with key elements of new generation of the similar treaties (IIAs). This will be followed by the support in preparing general guiding principles for negotiating effective IIAs and support the development of a checklist and elaboration of the key provisions and components of a model IIAs in line with global best practices.

In tourism component, the work will be organized on the sector level and target specific market segments (resulting from demand side market segmentation analysis) around five strategic pillars which address core obstacles to private sector growth and investment in the sector:
1. Filling the strategic prioritization and market positioning gap: The Project will conduct market research to understand which markets (and sub-segments) hold the most promise in terms of volume and revenue, which source countries generate the highest demand, what needs to be in place to attract these markets and improve local supply. Together with the client, select 1-2 market segments, and work with the client to prepare and implement an action plan to develop these market segments to address national goals. 
2. Enabling better air access and connectivity. 
3. Removing regulatory barriers. 
4. Targeted product development, investment outreach and servicing in the selected market segments (identified as a part of pillar 1 work). 
5. Facilitate access to finance for SMEs in tourism.",,,,,,"The Project objective is to enhance SME resilience and support recovery from COVID-19 crisis.

Hence the topic features prominently in the Sustainable Development Goals, the World Bank Group's (WBG) Gender Strategy, and IFC's 3.0 strategy focused on creating markets where needed the most. 

In addition to governments, parents, and care providers, employers can also play a role in meeting their employees' care needs and supporting their continued employment and the well-being of their families. 

Since 2017, IFC has published a series of global and regional reports on the business case and good practices for employer-supported childcare. Building on this research, IFC's Global Tackling Childcare Advisory Program is a three-year program that works with companies across regions and sectors to facilitate the implementation of good family-friendly practices through advisory engagements and peer learning. The Program has helped companies conduct employee childcare needs assessments, develop and implement action plans, share knowledge, and measure and communicate the business case for investing in childcare so that they can continue making these investments.

The program also focuses on improving the enabling environment for employer-supported childcare in the 26 countries where, according to IFC's research,  employers are legally mandated to provide childcare. The program does this by:
 Conducting research to identify care demand and supply barriers and gauge employer readiness for legal compliance, and by bringing together public and private sector partners to discuss the business case and solutions to increase compliance. In addition, through market research, the program aims to identify investment opportunities in nascent care markets.
 Working with the World Bank, governments, and related entities to inform childcare policies.

The program is being implemented through a network of partners to enable knowledge-sharing, action, collaboration, and creation of new tools. This network includes: 
 An internal WBG-wide working group that meets regularly to collaborate, coordinate efforts, and develop joint public-private sector solutions for advancing childcare.
 The IFC-led peer-learning collaboration in Pakistan with 14 companies that have made commitments to become family-friendly employers by implementing policies such as childcare, flex work, paid parental leave, safe transport, and breastfeeding facilities. Many of these companies have already met their commitments. 
 The IFC-led Global Tackling Childcare Working Group of more than 30 organizations (for e.g., Goldman Sachs, the ILO, LEGO, OECD, Patagonia, UN Global Compact, UN Women, and UNICEF) and the Government of Paraguay. The group has developed a first-of-its-kind global guide for employer-supported childcare, covering topics such as childcare demand assessments, quality, hygiene, nutrition, safety, financial sustainability, and results measurement. The guide is available at www.ifc.org/tacklingchildcareguide

The program's regional scope includes ongoing work in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Egypt, Fiji, India, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Romania, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam.

This can also lead to skill shortages and recruitment and retention challenges for employers, now and in future, which can negatively impact business and economic growth. The WBG Gender Strategy and the SDGs also highlight lack of childcare as a major barrier to women's access to more and better jobs. By tackling employer-supported childcare globally through this project and its five components, IFC aims to contribute to:

1) Enabling more companies in emerging markets to understand and meet their employees' childcare needs, become family-friendly employers, and realize better business outcomes. This can help advance employment opportunities for parents, particularly women, in the formal workforce and support their access to better, paid jobs by supporting their access to good quality and affordable employer-sponsored childcare. 
2) Helping companies to better measure and communicate the business case for their family-friendly policies so that they can continue investing in such policies, including childcare.
3) Strengthening markets for childcare by identifying investing potential in care and providing insights into care demand, supply, and policy frameworks in emerging markets, especially where employer-supported childcare is legally mandated.
4) Improving the enabling environment for childcare by advising governments and informing and improving policies that impact employer-supported childcare.
5) Providing global and regional platforms for companies to exchange knowledge of the business case and good practices for employer-supported childcare and inspire other companies to follow suit.

The childcare triple win - good for families, businesses, and economies - can help close gender gaps in employment and realize the WBG's twin goals of ending extreme poverty and increasing shared prosperity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,603007,,,Other,,2019-03-16T04:00:00Z,2019-02-28T05:00:00Z

The project covers 4 components and has been designed to cover current gaps in achieving financial inclusion, complementing many projects related to financial inclusion being carried out by the WBG. 

COMPONENT 1: Support development of the NFIS 

Advancement of full financial inclusion requires a clear strategy that considers diverse needs of various population segments, as well as an effective implementation plan to manage a broad range of financial inclusion activities in the country. National Financial Inclusion Strategies (NFIS) are usually developed by National Banks to serve as key tools in achievement of these objectives. The project will support the National Banks of both Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in developing and rolling out their respective NFIS.

COMPONENT 2: Support local financial institutions in the development of innovative products informed by behavioral finance and build internal capacity through trainings.

The project will work with FIs at the sectoral level, using different approaches to develop better financial products, and improve their internal capability. Activities under this component go hand in hand with the work under component 3 with individuals, being mutually beneficial.

COMPONENT 3: The project will strengthen financial capability of clients and help them to make responsible financial decisions. This component is closely aligned to component 2 and will contribute to product innovations with partner FIs. 

COMPONENT 4: The project will strengthen and assess financial capability in Uzbekistan

To improve financial inclusion and behavior, people need to become financially more capable. There is a need to improve the skills, attitudes, and motivation of stakeholders. The classical process of knowledge-skills-behavior activities has proven to be ill equipped to tackle these issues.

-	Development of training modules, manuals, principles and tools that can be used to promote quality of care, such as ethics, patient and family rights, medication management and use, quality improvement and patient safety, infection control, facility management and safety.
-	Development of case studies and/or reports. These knowledge management products will be based on client-level work undertaken in this project or experiences of the clients related to the effects of improvements in quality standards. 
-	Events (e.g., workshops, BBLs, webinars, etc.) and other dissemination activities to share case studies, best practices and lessons learned with IFC staff, clients, and other interested stakeholders to promote knowledge transfer and greater awareness of the tool and the broader quality agenda for the health sector.

Under the program IFC will forge long-term partnerships with municipalities, development partners and commercial institutions to support the implementation of municipalities' capital investment programs, including through advisory services and capacity building. Specifically, the Africa Cities Platform aims to apply the Cascade/Maximizing Finance for Development approach to urban infrastructure, thereby increase the total investment in sustainable urban infrastructure projects. The Platform will support municipalities in their planning and implementation of sustainable infrastructure projects, make them bankable and finance them by leveraging commercial capital, thereby complementing scarce public-sector resources. The Africa Cities Platform will focus on supporting municipalities across the full range of urban infrastructure sectors, including transport, municipal solid waste, water and waste water, green buildings, municipal finance, as well as smart city technologies. Entities eligible to receive support are municipalities and other relevant government organizations, municipally-owned companies, and private sector companies providing urban infrastructure services. In terms of sectors, the program will support cities in their priority areas, including urban mobility, water, waste, and energy.

Component 1: Strengthening Investment Policy framework 

This component will support Pakistan's and Federal BOI's strategic direction regarding FDI for the coming years. While the investment framework is generally open in Pakistan, there are regulatory obstacles related to investment entry requirements and investment guarantees. These barriers create procedural impediments to investors slowing down entry and impeding the creation of markets that can have a significant impact in terms of economic development for the country. Similarly, the 2013-2017 Investment strategy has expired and the BOI will develop a new strategic framework to guide its overall FDI policy and promotion efforts.

a) Development of an overarching strategic framework for investment 
b) Support for implementation of legal and regulatory reforms related to investment
c) Support development of investment finance for the private sector

Component 2: Strengthening Investment Attraction and Investment Assistance Framework

Under this component the project will support the Federal BOI and provincial BOIs to strengthen their ability to provide services to investors and enhance the country's external image and counter perceptions of conflict and insecurity. The project will support the Federal and Provincial BOIs to improve and better target their investment promotion activities and provide services to investors (investor aftercare). It will also strengthen the coordination between Federal and Provincial BOIs to ensure that investor needs are addressed and investment attraction strategies are implemented effectively. This component will support the development and implementation of an effective client management system and improved investment promotion materials, including support for investment promotion website. 

Component 3: Supporting Investment in Priority Sectors 

This component will support investments in priority sectors by conducting several in-depth diagnostics aimed at identifying opportunities for creating markets through FDI attraction. The program will conduct a sector scan which is designed to identify the priority sectors to guide Pakistan's promotional efforts and to identify opportunities to create and develop new markets in the medium to long term. The sector scan will help evaluate the competitiveness for investment attraction of different economic sectors leveraging on private and public-sector inputs and existing data and studies. The sector scan will also identify regulatory constraints that affect Pakistan's potential for creating markets and hamper sectoral competitiveness and FDI.

The market study will include a catalogue of main challenges to the feasibility of these projects and identify measures to address the challenges. The goal is not to carry out a detailed analysis of each flare site but to identify priority commercialization pathways and possible measures to reduce barriers. 

The scope of the study would include the following:
(i)	Current and future demand for, and prices of, end-products (electricity, methanol, fertilizers, other petrochemicals) or fuels that could be substituted (diesel, fuel oil, gasoline);
(ii)	Suitability in the Nigerian context of different proven technologies in commercial application that can convert flare gas into end products;
(iii)	Costs and other considerations at different stages along the supply chain, such as economies of scale, willingness and ability of potential consumers to pay, distance to and availability of large infrastructure, and risks that will reduce the commercial viability of projects;
(iv)	Net-back calculations based on end-product prices and costs incurred along the supply chain estimated in (iii) up to the custody transfer point; and
(v)	Market sounding with a range of stakeholders to obtain, amongst others, the following information: a) general perception among industry players regarding the NGFCP; b)  general feedback from the finance community regarding appetite to fund NGFCP projects and identify/quantify the main gaps that need to be mitigated; and c) input from original equipment manufacturers.

The study will prioritize projects based on the findings and calculate the financial rate of return and the maximum price of gas that can be offered, together with sensitivity analysis changing key assumptions (capital and operating expenditures, prices of gas or end-products being sold, the Nigerian/dollar exchange rate, and prices of competing goods and services where applicable).

As part of the market assessment, the consultant will undertake a consultation process with key stakeholders in the market first to collect data and information that will feed into their analysis.  A validation workshop will be organized by the consultant to share the preliminary findings with the various stakeholders and to gather feedback on the key findings. The consultant will use the feedback to revise and finalize the report.",,,,,,"The expected development impact of this activity will be reduced gas flaring in Nigeria and economic development enabled by use of natural gas and natural gas liquids to meet currently unmet demand. Reduced flaring will contribute to local and global environmental improvement by reducing the emissions of harmful local air pollutants and greenhouse gases. Possibilities for economic use of natural gas benefitting Nigeria include distributed electricity generation for local communities, use of natural gas liquids to market liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for household use, and manufacture of fertilizers for agriculture. Extending access to electricity and LPG to those who are currently without these sources of energy, creating new jobs, and improving the air quality will enhance the welfare of Nigerians.

The study will support the commercialization of flare gas in Nigeria under the Nigeria Gas Flare Commercialization Program (NGFCP) recently launched by the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN), which targets elimination of routine gas flaring in Nigeria. It will catalyze the development of bankable projects for private-sector investors and project developers, and contribute to flare gas auctions to be carried out by the FGN, by filling knowledge and information gaps, focusing particularly on market solutions outside of the grid-based power sector.

Farmers struggle to find proper off takers and often accept low paddy prices due to their inability to effectively engage in their supply chain, and overall export levels remain below the country's potential.  

At the smallholder level, yields and farm practices are generally poor if compared to neighboring countries. Farmers lack access to technology, inputs, knowledge and finance. E&S performance is generally low and market dynamics are poorly understood, and generally farmers have poor business and financial management skills. At the industry level, millers and exporters still faces poor and inconsistent paddy quality from farmers, attributable to (i) limited access to improved quality seeds, (ii) a highly-fragmented rice industry with too many intermediaries leading to a significant loss in value and quality across the value chain; (iii) ineffective supply chain development of high value varieties and iv) limited access to affordable inputs services. These combined constraints prove a great challenge for commercial investors and regional and international rice players to provide long term funding and enter into the Cambodia rice market. 

The project aims to address these challenges through a combined lead firm approaches in partnership with international players and their key domestic partners. The project has two specific objectives: (1) Increase access to SRP verified rice, including strengthening farmer groups/cooperatives and traceability; and (2) Improve farmers' adoption of technology climate smart agriculture practices including improve access to planting seeds and services. To achieve these objectives, the project has designed and implemented various interventions include: (i) SRP training; (ii) seed multiplication; (iii) introduction of technologies and mechanization; (iv) farmers financial literacy; (v) farmer group/cooperative strengthening; and (vi) traceability.

A number of studies have been prepared in the past, but the project never advanced beyond preliminary studies due to its cost and complexity and general disengagement of financiers from large-scale irrigation in the region in the 1980s. 
The Government requested support for the development from donors who responded with a joint AfDB/World Bank/IFC project identification mission in January 2011. The mission established several key principles to guide the design and implementation of the project, including that: the project would focus on commercial production, including smallholders in high value chains; professional management and PPPs to be pursued.
In cooperation with other donors the World Bank is now preparing a US$265.9 million project, of which IDA will fund US$160 million, for the development of SVIP.  The SVIP will fund the phased development of up to 42,500 ha of irrigation and drainage services associated with the proposed agricultural development.  The SVIP will initially cover 22,000 ha, of which over 12,000 ha are already developed and under commercial sugar cane production, mainly by Illovo where expensive electric-powered pumped irrigation will be replaced by gravity fed water from SVIP.  An additional 9,300 ha will be developed for new for irrigated agriculture.  Other components of the SVIP will fund smallholder-based agriculture modernization and commercialization and value chain support.
The SVIP as proposed by the WB is a 15-year program (2017-2032) structured around three coordinated pillars: (i) Providing reliable, professionally managed and sustainably-financed irrigation services to a large number of farmers in a phased construction, (ii) Supporting farmer organizations within a comprehensive land use plan; supporting land tenure strengthening and consolidation as well as natural resources management; and (iii) Establishing smallholder-owned commercial farm enterprises, supporting the transition from subsistence farming to commercial agriculture, and supporting the development of supply chains and access to markets.  IFCs involvement is with the first pillar only, the initial development and operation of the main irrigation infrastructure with a capital cost of approximately US$170 million.
The irrigation infrastructure will be located in the south of Malawi on the west bank of the Shire River. The first component is the development of the bulk water infrastructure through a gravity-fed network of over 60 km of primary canals. The primary canals will start at the intake at the existing Kapichira hydropower dam, which is operated by Escom, Malawis state-owned power utility. In order to ensure water availability for the SVIP, there will be no further development of the power generation capacity of Kapichira.  The primary canals will deliver bulk water to drinking-water treatment plants, to green-field irrigation projects (approximately 9,300 ha) and to the existing sugar cane farms: Illovo (about 10,000 ha); Kasinthula, Sande Ranch and Phata (about 2,180 ha in total).  Secondary canals will distribute water from the main canals to the different farms.

The proposed advisory project will be structured in two Components, each in two phases, the first phase providing advice on structural issues and the second phase assisting with implementing the agreed structure.   The scope of IFCs work will cover:
 - Component A: Commercial and legal structuring of the SVIP and associated WPAs.
 - Component B: Procurement of an incentive-based Management and Operations contract.",,,,,,"The Government of Malawi (""GoM"") intends to develop the Shire Valley Irrigation Project (""SVIP"") with the support of the World Bank and other donors.

Component I: Industrial parks sustainability and textile/ footwear sector reforms  The project will leverage the World Bank Groups ongoing engagements and dialogue on the Government's industrial parks and industrialization programs and carry out analysis to further drill down into the emerging challenges on environmental sustainability of the IPs and the selected sectors and identify regulatory and administrative gaps and constraints.  This component will have 4 areas of intervention:

1. Technical sector analysis of current environmental performance of selected industries The project will conduct research and survey existing investors in the industrial parks and assess the main challenges and concerns on competitiveness highlighting environmental and resource factors. This will include data on environmental performance and compliance, resource efficiency and common green infrastructure opportunities. The main focus will be on industrial parks, but solutions will also consider industries outside of industrial parks. This analysis will identify regulatory challenges, but also cost effective operating and technology solutions that sectors and industrial park operators can use to improve sustainability. 
2. Identify regulatory gaps for current status of regulations and performance of sector and suggestions for future changes - The country doesn't have a green manufacturing policy in place yet, even though there are new initiatives to develop green manufacturing strategy and policy. On the other hand, there are binding/stringent constraints in the current environmental strategy of Ethiopia at the Ministry of Environment which were enacted 20 years ago. These regulations are not adequate to respond to current realities and the Government's ambitious industrialization strategy. The project will assist GoE in the formulation of a structured policy for sustainable industrialization and help formulate compliance standards for sustainable manufacturing within industrial parks while still maintaining the sectors' global competitiveness. 
3. Development of sustainability action plan for industrial parks  Based on the technical analysis, the project will design sustainability action plans for selected industrial parks. GIZ has been developing a project to set up Environmental Social Management Framework at IPs. The project will coordinate with GIZ to give a comprehensive approach to GoE on addressing E&S related issues in IPs.
4. Sector sustainability roadmap Lastly, based on the technical analysis and benchmarking exercise and in consultation with private sector actors, the team will develop sector specific sustainability action plans for the textile and footwear sectors. This action plan will provide further details and prioritization of actions for the growth of these sectors. It will provide guidance on how these may be implemented in the industrial parks framework, and will be aligned with the sustainability action plan for the IPs.

Based on engagement and consultations with the key stakeholders and counterparts, the program comprises 4 components each of which addresses a critical challenge:
1. Business Regulation/Delivering Business Environment Reforms: 
South Africa's business environment, as measured by the annual DB Report has progressively worsened over the last few years [currently ranked 82/190 countries, South Africa was ranked 29 in 2007]. The continued retrogression, while making the creation of new businesses difficult, also feeds a narrative of poor Government to Business service and contributes to the private sector's reticence to invest and create jobs. 
Under this component, the program will support South Africa to achieve reforms in indicators that it has prioritized - Starting a Business, Trading Across Borders and Paying Taxes. 

2. Investment Policy & Promotion: 
In order to meet the objectives of the inter-Ministerial Committee (created by the Government to generate FDI), South Africa requires additional support to boost its ability to attract and retain FDI and to tap into supply and value chains in South Africa and elsewhere. InvestSA, which is South Africa's investment promotion agency does not presently have the requisite capacity and has requested technical support to lead South Africa's drive to reshape its economy.

Further to a request from DTI, technical support rendered under this component will include:
(a) Development of an Investment Reform Map (IRM) and a Systematic Investment Retention Mechanism (SIRM). The IRM process helps countries clarify their investment objectives and yields a comprehensive review of policy, institutional, legal and regulatory barriers to FDI that generates a blue print for reform. 
(b) Strengthening of Capacity for Investment Promotion: A fundamental factor for the success of the IPP component would be strengthening of the Investment Promotion and aftercare services capacity of InvestSA. 
(c) Technical Support for Investment Generation into Industrial Parks.
(d) Review of Government Policy on linkages and local supplier development with particular reference to BBBEE: The team will work closely with the DTI at the national level as well as with 1-2 provincial/city level counterparts focusing on specific Industrial Park initiatives in order to meet the objectives of the Industrial Policy Action Plan 2017/18 - 2019/20. 

3. Competition Policy/Market Regulation Reform: 
This component supports the development of a holistic approach to competition policy in SA which aims to support the alignment of government interventions in markets (laws and regulations, broader public policies and direct state participation) with principles that strengthen market competition. The program will support the development of tools to strengthen the enforcement of the competition law to allow competition authorities to use their resources to detect and sanction anticompetitive behavior more effectively. It will also focus on broadening of the scope of competition policy in South Africa and equip policy makers with mechanisms to identify and reform distortions to competition caused by government interventions in markets in order to support entry and competition in key sectors of the economy. 

4. Private Sector Diagnostics and Analysis: 
The program will undertake a Country Private Sector Diagnostic and sector scans to identify key private sector investment opportunities to develop backwards and forward linkages. The said diagnostic and sector scans will also be undertaken with an analytical lens that will seek to identify the principal growth constraints of small and young businesses.",,,,,,"The 4-year Program aims at addressing key investment and growth challenges facing the South African economy such as poor regulation, anti-competitive practices and negative investor perceptions. It will focus on a range of horizontal and vertical sectoral reforms with special attention to SMEs. The Program seeks to contribute to addressing the unemployment and poor economic growth that the South Africa National Development Plan (NDP) 2030 identifies as key development challenges. The Project will be further calibrated to reflect findings from Country Private Sector Diagnostics and an Enterprise Survey both of which will identify sector specific investment opportunities and obstacles. 

Projected impact under the Program components are:

1. Business Regulation: 
(a) 10% reduction in compliance costs and time to comply for Starting a Business, Paying Taxes and Trading across Borders Doing Business indicators; 
(b) Sector specific regulatory reforms in sectors identified by Private Sector Diagnostic/Sector Scans and Enterprise Survey (due in 2018) where RSA has competitive advantages in generating investment.

2. Investment Policy and Promotion:
(a) A blueprint for reform and at least one reform each to address current policy, institutional, legal and regulatory barriers to FDI; 
(b) Design and deployment of an institutional reform strategy for investment promotion; 
(c) Design and deployment of an investor-State conflict management mechanism that will enable the GoSA and investors to address any grievances well before they escalate into full blown legal disputes; 
(d) A national strategy on investment promotion, including generation of investment into Industrial Parks; 
(e) Review of Government Policy on linkages and local supplier development.

3. Competition Policy/Market Regulation: 
(a) Identification of policy and regulatory obstacles to entry and competition in 2 sectors; 
(b) Design tools to strengthen competition law enforcement and advocacy by the Competition Authorities; 
(c) Deployment of an evidence-based engagement framework on competition issues in order to support advocacy to address barriers to competition

4. Private Sector Diagnostics and Analysis: 
(a) Identification of key opportunities for promoting private sector investment through the Country Private Sector Diagnostic and Sectors Scans.

IFC will help maintain and develop market based approaches for off-grid lighting and energy products globally through provision of market information, targeted advisory services to Pay As You Go (PAYGO) companies, and select off grid manufacturers and distributors. In partnerships with the Off-Grid Lighting Association (GOGLA) and CGAP, IFC will work with industry and investors towards a PAYGO performance, reporting and measurement framework to increase transparency and eventually unlock capital for the sector.  
IFC will help sustain adoption of off-grid quality standards (IEC 62257-9-5), which IFC helped create. It will do so by promoting these standards with Chinese manufacturers. It will preserve the standards through its partnership with CLASP, the leading resource for appliance energy efficiency policies, which is implementing the standards across several governments globally. The program will also continue to provide market insights and intelligence through its research activities to inform the industry's strategy and business plans.
IFC will leverage its ten-year experience in the private sector off-grid markets to endorse market-based approaches to development partners related to the design and implementation of their off-grid programs. 
Expected Development Impact for Public Disclosure
The objective of this project is to support and maintain the development of market-based approaches for off-grid lighting and energy to ultimately increase access for households across off-grid markets. The key outcome of this project will be:

-  adoption of off-grid quality standards (IEC 62257-9-5), especially by manufacturers in China
-  Provide a range of market insights and intelligence within the off-grid lighting and energy sector and including emerging opportunities in related productive use appliances using solar.
- develop industry performance and measurement framework in conjunction with investors and companies to mobilize investment",,,,,,"The project is expected to contribute to the following: 

- Increased adoption of quality standards (IEC 62257-9-5) globally and especially by Chinese manufacturers 
- Increased transparency in reporting by and to investors and PAYGO companies ultimately unlocking commercial funding
- Incorporation of recommendations, made by IFC to development partners, into the design and implementation of their off-grid lighting and energy programs to follow a market-based and sustainable approach to energy access",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,602073,,,Infrastructure and Natural Resources,,2018-01-30T05:00:00Z,2018-02-01T05:00:00Z
